0,Keeping the world's longest railroad tunnel safe,"The Gotthard Base Tunnel is the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world, 57 kilometers through the Alps. Around the turn of the century, there were two devastating fires in road tunnels under those mountains, and the authorities here in Switzerland want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again. We're going to see the control center that watches over the tunnel, and also visit one of the intervention centers, with the firefighters and first responders that'll step in if the worst were to happen. And then I want to show you what I reckon is the most important bit of safety equipment, and most people will probably never notice it. It isn't anywhere near the tunnel. But before that, we start at the control centers, just over there. There are different sections to control the traffic. The signal box controls the track. The movement authority is given by the signal box, and by the traffic controller. If there is a disturbance in one of these thirds, the train can be diverted to bypass the disturbed section. We have to be able to evacuate the entire tunnel within 90 minutes. If a train has a technical problem, first of all the train driver tries to reboot the train system. If it's not successful, we have the firefighting train, which goes into the tunnel to tow out the broken train."
1,Why do YouTubers clap at the start of videos?,"To make it easy to sychronise the audio and video later. But that's not really an answer to the question, is it? If the question was ""why do YouTubers clap at the start of their recordings"", then yes, that's the answer, it's to help with synchronisation. When I'm filming on my own with a static camera, it can sometimes look like I'm just stood against a green-screen. But clapping, walking into frame, letting the focus settle, showing that behind-the-scenes moment... it proves I'm here, it makes me seem more trustworthy. For someone vlogging from their bedroom, keeping those claps and the slip-ups helps make them relatable. I don't really want to be relatable? But Trustworthy is good, and leaving the clap and video in the video establishes that I'm one person with one person. Showing that clap is all about fitting the message to the medium, not just what you want to say, but the subtext of how you say it. It's all about the aesthetics, not about the camera setup, but how you handle it. I've done that plenty of times before. I'll leave that in when I actually do have a crew."
2,This massive truck makes artificial earthquakes,"The University of Texas has a machine designed to shake the ground itself. It can go up to about 60,000 pounds force vertically, and about half horizontally. We have sensors that we've designed and we will push in because there are pushing rams on the back of Liquidator and T-Rex. We were out there in Wyoming and the darn cows walked by. Fortunately, they didn't break any cables, but we had to stop testing because they made more noise. They were right out there and we were half a mile away. Oh, my goodness. Every time we go someplace, we'll make sure the level won't damage structures. We just came back from Wyoming, where they're going to build new power plants, and the earthquake design is critical. We generated a 6000-foot-long wave. Now we generated a two foot long wave, too, but going through the range. So that means we could evaluate the stiffness profile down to half amile. With no boreholes! That is really a true accomplishment and a very, very cost effective addition to the design of the plant. So this is a sensor. It's a big magnet with a coil. The coil is going through a magnetic field. And that's what's going on here."
3,How the US Postal Service reads terrible handwriting,"Almost all the letters that get sent in the United States are processed automatically. The postal service sends the picture of the envelope here to the Remote Encoding Center, the REC, in Salt Lake City, Utah. It's the job of the folks here to turn scrawl and blurred ink into actual addresses. If the machine can't read your handwriting, one of the keyers here will type in the missing information, and the information goes right back to the plant, which is a whole lot cheaper than having somebody physically sort that piece by hand. If it matches a couple of good addresses, then you'll get a list and you'll choose out of that list. If there's not a good address, you've got to clear it out with a space, and those flats and packages are sitting on a conveyor belt. Those pieces are live, and if we don't key them in 90 seconds, they get buffered and get back in the machine. That will be a lot of fun. We're in the last RemoteEncoding Center in the U.S. Back in 1997, when we had 55 RECs open, all of those RECs combined keyed 19 billion images. The OCR technology is so good that, in 2021, as the last REC remaining, we only keyed 1.2 billion images, and we have about 810 employees here."
4,"This clock was famous, but the internet ruined it.","The Dutch flower market is one of the largest commercial buildings in the world. Every weekday, millions of fresh flowers are being bought and sold inside. The auction room used to be full of buyers, frantically pushing buttons to bid. But the internet enabled remote buying, so the seating got emptier over the years. By the mid-2010s, those auction rooms weren’t being pushed through the auction rooms, and by the end of the decade, the rooms were closed down. It's basically a reenactment of what gets kept alive as a tourist attraction, or preserved by a group of volunteers. It turns over billions of euros every year, if they keep running. The replacement is many auctioneers running many different clocks, all at the same time, sitting in cubicles with microphones. The Dutch Flower Auction Clock is no more, but the flower market that it was once part of is still there, and it runs on an almost incomprehensible scale. It’s a giant, high-speed, hyper-optimised clearing-house: growers deliver flowers in the early morning and by lunchtime they’re sold and on their way to buyers, either via the warehouses next door or in trucks that ship them onwards. The famous part is how the flowers are sold there. If you’ve heard of a Dutch auction? This is oneof those auctions, I think the biggest one anywhere."
5,The massive Fatigue Carousel helps keep roads safe,"The fatigue carousel is one of only a few of its kind in the world. It can simulate, in a few months, 10 or 20 years of traffic on the real road. Testing on this carousel doesn't mean just for a few hours or a few days. A test here can last months, the carousel constantly rotating, with the wheels travelling at anything up to 100km/h. There are actually three different circular test tracks here. The carousel can be taken apart and moved between them, to run several different tests at once. One of the tracks is also watertight, for testing how pavements behave on wet or soaked ground. And I really hope that the size and scale of this thing is coming across on camera, because I've had to change my microphone to the windproof one, because of how much turbulent air this thing generates. Those arms are massive. It is genuinely unnerving to be standing here, not able to see this massive machine behind me. They are just twice as big as I am. And then there is the ageing of the materials. They become more brittle. And obviously we cannot simulate that, because we have to do the test in several months. You can't build those models without real-world data. And when you're grounded in truth, you're not going to be able to test them."
6,How does Britain know what time it is?,"National Physical Laboratory, NPL, broadcasts a time signal to the UK in a simple enough format that the cheap electronics inside this clock can understand it. We steer from NPL based on measuring what Anthorn is broadcasting at the level of nanoseconds. There's a light-speed delay, a latency, of about a thousandth of a second between the transmitter here and the base in London. It's a very low frequency, 60 kilohertz, it has very low susceptibility to atmospheric effects. Things like the Square Kilometre Array, a planet-wide array of telescopes that's being planned and built now have to be synchronised with radio waves around the globe. When they're listening for incredibly faint radio waves from space, the whole experiment could fall apart. So when the public can get time that's more than accurate for almost every purpose from satellites in space: why is this signal still important? And the team at NPL had a rather serious answer. Time is really an invisible utility. It underpins our digital infrastructure, whether it's the grid, or the telecom networks, or finance or high-frequency trading. We are so dependent on GPS and other constellations, and if those signals are disrupted easily, we are easily easily disrupted."
7,Reopening an airport terminal is harder than you might think,"South Terminal at London's Gatwick Airport will reopen to the public on Sunday. It has been closed for nearly two years due to a downturn in traffic. The first flight from the South Terminal is scheduled to leave on Sunday in the early hours of the morning. The scale of what we're doing here is... we've often likened it to opening a smaller airport, completely from scratch. It is a huge task that we're undertaking. I'm feeling really confident, actually. I think we're in a really good place to do it. And they probably won't know or care that the terminal's only just opened again. They'll just want to get to their destination. If everything goes to plan, they likely won't even know that theTerminal was ever closed. We're reopening 85% of it straight away. We've got a phased plan for our airlines moving back over from North Terminal over three days, but all the infrastructure will come online more or less from day one. In terms of a challenge? Yeah, it's the biggest one I've done at Gatwick airport. It's been open for 60-odd years, that's now being closed for the best part of two years. You know, buildings don't react too well to that sort of thing."
8,The top secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire,"Report was written in June 1969, a month before Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. It was about Peaceful Nuclear Explosions, an idea that was in fashion at the time. The theory was that we could create artificial harbours and canals using nuclear bombs. The US and the Soviets would work out that it was a bad idea by the 1970s. But it turns out at least some people in the UK were interested as well. They commissioned a full study, laying out the pros and cons, comparing the cost to other methods of storage. They had picked a site. The plan was: buy all the land for about a mile around. Drill down 2,000 feet, about 600 metres, with a special extra-wide drill bit, big enough so they could drop a 25 kiloton nuclear bomb down to the bottom of the hole. Plug up the hole, cover the top so nothing comes out, hopefully. Evacuate the thousand or so people who live nearby, just in case. Not much would happen on the surface. There'd be a bit of a jolt and a rumble, a few birds startled into the air. The local towns of Pickering and Whitby, about ten miles away each, they'd feel a minor earthquake, and maybe a couple of buildings would get small cracks in them."
9,"There's a £100,000 coin buried under this London building","In 1933, Britain didn't need any more pennies. The Royal Mint decided they wouldn't make any one-pence coins that year. Trouble is, King George V needed some. It was tradition for the King to bury a full set of new coins from that year in the foundations of new and important buildings as they were constructed. So the Royal Mint did make some 1933 coins. No-one actually kept the records of how many there were, but it was probably... seven. While the face value of those seven coins is a penny, they're so rare that the price at auction these days is easily more than £100,000. The last sold in 2016 for a hammer price of around £140,000 - it's the first time one's been sold for many, many years. So there are probably seven 1933 pennies - three are in private collections. Two are in museums. And the others...   ...well, that's the possible heist movie. Because remember, the king buried some of the coins. One of them was buried under this church in Middleton, West Yorkshire. In 1970, it was stolen. Whereabouts still unknown, although presumably if someone in Yorkshire finds a 1933 penny in their grandparents' coin collection, there'll be a bit of suspicion."
10,The hidden background noise that can catch criminals,"The National Grid have recently released their data, seven years recorded right at the source. The whole grid runs at the same, slightly wobbling, almost-50 hertz, no matter where you are. That mains hum can be really annoying for people recording audio. But if you were to log what that wobbling grid frequency was, every second of every day, then in theory, you'd have a perfect watermark to prove the time when anything was recorded. Does it work? Well to find out, I asked some friends of mine who make videos to send me over some of their raw footage, unprocessed, unfiltered. And I asked the forensic team: can you timestamp it? First up, footage from Taha,  one of the team behind educational channel Answer in Progress. There's a quite strong component here, and you can see it's got a bit of a wobble. But we can be fairly confident this is an ENF trace. Next up, Hannah Witton, sex and relationships educator. There wasn't a component at around 50 hertz. So there's a possibility that it's just ambient noise. And there's no strong component at all at all for the next step to look for. So he sent B-roll from his channel, because he's not talking to thermostat."
11,The world's most expensive object by weight,"The British Guiana one cent magenta stamp is worth $8.3 million. It was first discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old schoolboy. It is the only stamp in British Commonwealth history where no other examples have ever turned up. Stanley Gibbons was lucky enough to purchase the stamp at auction in New York. It's on display to the public here, at least in part, because the company is selling shares in it and more fame will help it keep or raise its value. If you want to challenge this for ""the most expensive object in the world by weight"", and take the very, very tiny crown, the first step would be to find something even lighter and just as non-fungible. Good luck, you'll have to watch the video to find out what the answer to the question in the title, it's this stamp. The video will be shown every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, just for conservation and light reasons, but indefinitely here in an oxygen-free conservation case.

12,"An actual, real-world use for robot dogs","Energy Robotics is putting software on robots to make them smart. The robot has built-in navigation and obstacle avoidance. We need to have more robots on the ground, because we have not enough engineers. The goal is to replace certain parts in the long run, especially those where humans need to be sent in hazardous environments. In Germany, we have about 8,000 substations that need inspections, and the number of substations is growing due to the change to renewable energy. We are using a robot to continuously do inspection tasks, and therefore testing if this is plausible in the middle of the Alps. This trial will succeed or fail based on two questions:  does it work, or does it fail? And if so, will it be cheaper overall than sending out people, particularly when there might be a shortage of engineers in the future? The robot is not remote controlled. It's doing that task autonomously.  That means we teach it a certain mission,  and the robot does the repetition of the mission. But it'll also be able to do something called ""click and inspect"", which means we have a digital twin of the environment, and then we're just saying what the robot needs to inspect. And the robot plans a path towards the inspection point and gets the information. It then autonomously extracts that information and reacts based on the results."
13,The Islands With Too Much Power,"The Orkney Islands, in the far north east of Scotland, have a huge surplus of renewable energy. The islands need between 7 and 46 megawatts of power, depending on the time of day and year. Solution number one is to turn off the turbines, but that's a waste. Solution two is to build a new interconnector that could carry enough power for the islands away from the mainland. Solution three is that the islands could start using more electricity for heating, ferries and heating. But most vehicles still use petrol or diesel, and getting around with ferries could change things for a lot of people around the country, including the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands. And solution four is to find a better way to get power from all the wind turbines that could reasonably put power all the way to the highlands of Scotland. But that will cost a quarter of a billion pounds, and it's all still politically in the balance in the Scottish National government to make sure it's going to be used, before it's approved. It's all a bit of a mess, but it's the only way we're going to get the power that we need in the long term, so we're not going to give up on it just yet."
14,The Shocking New Use for Red Telephone Boxes,"Community Heartbeat Trust provides community defibrillators in disused phone boxes. When a community contacts us, we'll let the local ambulance service know that a defibrilator is going in. When somebody phones 999, the ambulance service will be able to say ""It's located at the phone box, on the corner of X and Y roads"" The box is connected to the national grid so the light and the phone could work back when it was an actual phone box. It doesn't have an electricity meter, but it's never needed one. The electricity is there to provide electricity for the cabinet because there's a heater in the cabinet. It's not for thedefibrillator, the defibillators all work off batteries. And the heater is important because batteries do degrade in cold weather. The electrodes are water gel so they will freeze. There are concerns over maintaining dignity... life comes before dignity. We just need to use it on a dummy. It is as realistic a simulation as it's possible to get. So here's the story. Someone has collapsed, someone else is doing CPR, and I've been sent by the emergency operator to get this. I have to assume here's someone here doing CPR. It will tell you to take this... On/Off/Adult mode. Okay, we've done that now."" ""Call Emergency Medical Services now."""
15,History forgot these old fireworks. We recreated them.,"There are more than 200 rock cannon around Wales and they were used for all sorts of events. They more or less faded out in the mid-20th century. Most of the mines have closed and far fewer people have ready access to explosives these days. Back in the day, the Welsh miners would use goose quill. It was the only sort of natural tube you could find. So they'd chop a piece of goose. quill, fill it full of gunpowder, and then when you light one end of. it, it'll burn incrementally from that end down and then squirt a. bit of flame out of the other end. This is an exact replica of the cannon at Betws-y-Coed and we're going to fire it. It should be pretty much what a visiting dignitary would hear echoing round the Welsh valleys. I mean, that lovely. Like, the steady glow as it went through each one and then boom, boom for a while. Yeah. One of things I really want to stress is that building rock cannon takes skill. For a rock cannon, you want something that is going to maintain the hole and keep it and reuse it. Let's say you got this rockary in the next layer and that you can't get it out. That could be disastrous."
16,The world's last turntable ferry has a really clever design,"There's only one turntable ferry left in the world, and it's on Skye in western Scotland. The ferry has been operated by a man called Roddy MacLeod since the 1980s. When the tolls were removed from the Skye Bridge, he felt that the ferry's time was up. So, the local community banded together and thought, ""We can't have this"" The ferry is very seldom pointing in the direction it's actually going. Because of the wind and because of the tide, we often have to set the boat going in a different direction to allow us to get to where we want to go. The water here is tidal and the current is fast. There is quite a strong current. Even if you could line up straight reliably, you can only tie the boat off at the front, so the back's probably going to swing out a bit. Great for people, not so useful for cars. And that's where the Turntable comes in. The turntability is a remarkable piece of Victorian engineering. It was based on the old railway turntables system. Usually, it's two, but one person can turn it. A lot of oil and grease is expended in keeping it as smooth as we can. Very, very rare indeed that we can't work it."
17,The long-forgotten history of the British moon spacesuit,"In the 1940s, 15 years before Kennedy said that America ""chose to go to the moon"", the British Interplanetary Society did have similar plans. One of their number, illustrator Ralph Smith, drew up plans for a spacesuit. It looks wonderful, but no one ever built it... until a few years ago. So, I get a call, and where do you start? You've got two drawings basically. Rather than just say, ""Well, I'll make a replica, a facsimile of it,"" I thought ""Let's look at the materials that were available at the time."" Cotton and rubber, much like a modern space suit is made out of beta fabric and a rubber pressure layer inside. And the pressure's inside it. It can't expand out any further. And that means there's no physical transfer of heat from the suit out into the vacuum of space. You have to have an airlock on the front of his chest, he's got this rather strange device on the surface of the moon. And it gives you a walking stick-cum-seat on the lunar surface. But you also notice there is a shooting stick on the part of the seat of the suit that you open the airlock and shoot down the rock."
18,I promise this story about microwaves is interesting.,"A well-known story about the engineer who ""invented the microwave"" is wrong. The first microwave as we'd know it today, a cheap box that you plug in, was from the late 1960s. At no point in that well-referenced story does anyone mention heating hamsters in laboratories in the 1950s. Those papers were written by scientists at the National Institute for Medical Research. They used ice and a glycol bath of glycol, which is a propylene glycol de-icer, held at 1°C. At that point, the animal is dead and will not recover on its own. No breathing rate, no breathing core, no heart rate. No heart and no breathing rate. The technical term is ""diathermic heating"" The first commercial microwave, called the Radarange, was the size of a fridge. It had to be actively cooled. It was incredibly expensive and it was designed for big commercial kitchens. But inside here is... Inside here in the bit you can't access, there's a microwave generator called a magnetron. It moves electric current past a big magnet with a hole in it. And because... physics, that produces electromagnetic radiation. The best analogy I've found is that it's like blowing air over glass bottles and changing the pitch by changing the amount of water inside."
19,Why Hollywood explosions don't look like real explosions,"The film industry has a lot of tricks to make the explosions in movies look like the audience expects them to, all fire and flame and devastation. For a Hollywood effect, we don't actually use the Semtex because it's designed to do damage for its military purpose. We want something that looks nice but does the minimum amount of damage possible. The explosive charge is just there to propel the fuel out, vaporise it, make a big cloud of it, which can then be ignited. So the visual effect is from the cloud of fuel igniting. And the explosive is just used to create that cloud. With all the explosives in place, the second trick is how you film it. By moving the camera back and zooming in, you make it look like your actor is much, much closer to the explosion and it means the whole frame is filled up while everyone's still at a safe distance. Then, you shoot in slow motion. You make the explosion seem even longer by shooting from multiple angles and repeating it several times. And you tell your actor not to flinch. Also, you hope he doesn't give a cheesy grin. Like, sort of give down the camera a cold steel glare. I just had a thing on my face. Did that work? I'm looking this way at the explosion."
20,Why 18th-Century Firefighters Let Some Buildings Burn,"The Great Fire of London in 1666 lasted for four days. The idea of ""firefighters"" hadn't really been invented at that point. After the Great Fire, the job of fire protection in London was taken up by insurance companies. Building owners would pay a fee for a few years' coverage, and the insurance company would attach a metal ""fire mark"" to the front of the building. In 1866, the government finally took over and created the London Fire Engine Establishment as a public service. But that was only after another major fire. It took disaster, it took death and destruction, to move things forward to the point where you can call the fire service to save lives, not just property, and without having to worry about the bill. If firefighters standing aside while a building burns seems immoral to you... well, there are lots of places where that's still the case today. Or where firefighting companies will send a bill afterwards, assuming that an insurance company will pay it. In places where there aren't enough people, or there's not enough political will for a government-funded fire service, that may still be the only option. In London, it wasn't until 1833 that ten of those insurance companies joined their fire brigades together to create a single fire service......still private."
21,"Hill Hill Hill Hill, debunked, debunked","There is no Torpenhow Hill marked on any official map. The name's almost certainly a modern invention. It's not really ""hill hill hill"", that village, you can plausibly translate ""torpenhow"" as a small rise jutting out from a much bigger incline. The land around this point is lower, and it sits right next to Trepenna-slash-Torpenhow. In reality, there's just the village of ""Trepenna"". Tor-pen-how Hill doesn't exist. And so now, I'm going to debunk the debunk. Because if that's true, why am I out  of breath? What did I just climb? I came up here from the village, it's  a slow steady climb on a country road. The only thing stopping this  officially being ""Torpen how Hill""   is that there's not enough consensus. Sure, the village is ""T repenna"",  but this can be TorpenHow Hill, if enough people want it to be. And as I record this, if you  type ""TorPenhow Hill"" into online maps... quite a few of them point you here. Actually, just over there, I'll CG in a giant map marker just to make my point. That one is being slowly destroyed by tourism and by vandals."
22,Five Things You Can't Do On British Television,"When a medium has that much power, it gets regulated heavily. Any demonstrations of hypnosis on stage  must be licensed: and that's still true. A fine for unlicensed  stage hypnosis can be £1,000. There's a list of sporting events, defined by Parliament, that must be available on free-to-air television. Governments do not want those events of national importance to become irrelevant because they're only available to pay-for television services. You can't risk someone flipping through channels only to land on fictional news story and think there's been a disaster ahead. Command-of-the-time reporting does have a modern sense of fake news, although the fake news in the War of the Worlds does have over here as well, but fake news is over there as well. It's complicated and it's messy, and there are all sorts of rules to try and establish some sort of level playing field. But better safe than sorry, I think. I really Do Not Get It. I mean that literally, I  checked a hypnosis textbook. And there's almost two minutes of it, complete with slow-eye contact zoom! But he didn't say it was hypnosis. He never claimed to be hypnotizing people. He's just influencing with  some words and some wavy lines."
23,My unlicensed hovercraft bar is technically legal,"In England, if you want to sell alcohol to the public, you need a licence. The law about that is set down in the Licensing Act 2003. There are a lot of details in there, including some exceptions. For example, as long as you're ""on a journey"", you do not need an alcohol licence to sell on a train, a plane.....or a hovercraft. So, why does this law exist? Why is there a ridiculous exemption by local authorities in England? And while these days, there's only one hovercraft service, we used to have massive hovercraft racetracks that'd cross the Channel to France. After all this, who's gonna be ridiculous enough to sell enough alcohol from a moving hovercraft? After all these years, it doesn't need to be updated, because the law hasn't been updated. But yes, the contactless card reader really did work. And yes, that is a terrible half pint of beer. Most of the foam from it got pulled onto me. Oh, and watch the plastic glass between my knees there. Yeah, we picked that up later too.​ Note that I'm using a thimble measure for the gin there. Free pour of spirits for drinks like that isn't legal in the UK.​ You're fine if it's a complicated cocktail, but for something simple like gin and tonic, legally, you have to measure it out."
24,The tiny monorails that once carried James Bond,"The Roadmachines Mono-Rail was invented in a small town just outside London in the 1940s. It was intended for construction sites, and it was in competition with tractors and dump trucks. The track is made of prefab parts, so it could be set up just by clamping bits together like a giant toy train set. By 1966, there were 800 of these monorails in the UK. They were in use until at least the 1990s. Most were scrapped, but enthusiasts keep a few of them running: this one is at the Amberley Museum in southern England. There are also dozens in a collection at Nantmawr in north Wales, including one that's been modified to allow passenger rides. And, sure, yes, the diesel engine is quite noisy, but it's designed forConstruction sites. Oh, and yeah, it's automated. At the end of the track, there's an automatic stop built in, where it stops, and waits to be sent on its way again. It's not that monorail are inherently a bad thing. It is just that in most cases, there are better solutions. Sometimes, like here, they're the right tool for the job, much to the amusement of the passengers."
25,Would you swim in power plant wastewater?,"Iceland has a massive supply of hot water, which can be used to generate electricity. The water comes from geothermal power plants, which use it to heat up cold water. Reykjavík has an artificial hot water lagoon, but there are also hot springs elsewhere in the world. Iceland also has quite a lot of fresh air, and when it's snowing, the pavements are heated up by hot water pipes under the ground. The two end-pressure steam that comes up from the boreholes at the power plants is undrinkable. So there's one end that's loose after that, and there's a loose end after that that you can get out of the tap in your home, just like you'd get out the cold tap in a regular home. But this isn't power plant wastewater. It's wastewater from a power plant that's been boiled to spin the turbines and then cooled back down again. It doesn't actually feel warm, if it did the pipe wouldn't be doing its job, because the water only loses a couple of degrees over dozens of kilometres, but yes, hot water speeding through that. If your home is connected to that grid you don't need a water heater. So, okay, that's hot water. If you want electricity instead, you can spin a turbine using the high- pressure steam that's coming up, and generate clean power that way."
26,The Part Of Britain That Rises And Falls Twice A Day,"The Newlyn Datum is the zero point from which all heights in Britain are measured. The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon that are what's causing the ocean to move, and the tides, just happened to synchronise more or less in their timescale with the way in which the North Atlantic is able to move. On some days, Cornwall might only move up and down by three or four centimetres compared to its average position. Whereas on other days the movement might be seven or eight centimetre. The reason it doesn't start causing big things like earthquakes is because these movements add up to something appreciable and measurable by our modern, accurate techniques. But the most accurate engineering to need to worry about this problem is with GPS, the global positioning system. It's just a little bit like if you have a glass of juice, but if you swirl it around at just the right speed, you can build up quite a big slosh around the edges of the glass. If you swirl the glass at the wrong speed, as it were, for that glass, then you get a much smaller amount of motion. But what we can do is we can make huge numbers of measurements of this. And we can measure that distance very precisely indeed at something like the two or three millimetre level of precision."
27,Britain once forgot how long an inch is,"The international standard for length is the meter, and it's based on unchanging physical constants. But before metric, Britain had physical standards for the old imperial units, too, dating back centuries. The first prototype that could be called a British national standard was a brassrod that was created in 1760. In 1825, the yard, so three feet, 36 inches, was defined as being the distance between the marks on that one object, stored with the Clerk of the House of Commons, in Parliament. Nine years after that law was passed, Parliament burned down. All the standards for imperial units were also destroyed in that fire. Which meant Britain didn't have any legal standard of measurement. But that was fine! Because  the law also had a provision for what to do in that case:  you make a new Standard Yard, defined by the length of a pendulum that takes a certain amount of time to swing. But the law later put it, ""by the Researches of scientific Men  Doubts were thrown on the Accuracy"". So instead, the standard was reconstructed based on the versions that had been made over all the years, not like tape measures, or anything like that, but the things that were one step down that step down."
28,The Village That The Luftwaffe Bombed By Mistake,"In 1941, the Luftwaffe bombed Linby Docks in Nottinghamshire. But the streams that run through the village were not strategic bombing targets. The bombs missed and no one was even slightly hurt, although one farmer's field had some unexpected and rather violent ploughing done to it. It's part of the local mythos here in Linby. But there's nothing from the time that backs it up, just folklore and stories told from parent to child, from elder to youth, for maybe the last 80 years. The only people who know for sure are over 90 years old and, look, no one should bother them trying to disprove or prove one bit of local folklore. One is not a story, not at least not in 1941; it would be today. We call them urban legends or eventually just legends? Probably not. Over a long period of time, no. Does it really burn cakes? Over no matter how long of a time, it's not a matter of time. I am expected to provide evidence for claims, so rightly so. I'm only completely clear of things I have had completely clear memories of that evidence later showed me wrong. No one might not have mentioned it back then because Newspapers back then may not have been mentioned it."
29,How England's Oldest Road Was Nearly Lost Forever,"The Icknield Way is one of Britain's oldest still-surviving paths. It stretches more than 100 miles across southeast England. Landowners do not get a say in who walks along those paths and it's a criminal offence to block them. England has until January 1st, 2026 to find and log all its footpaths. But with five years to go, the Ramblers charity decided to try and solve the problem. They asked thousands of people to check one bit of the map each. They were shown that square on the current OS map and a couple of historic maps from about 120 years ago. We think we've found tens of thousands of miles of lost rights of way. The real work starts now and that's about proving that these public paths were historically right of way and can be put back on the map. They can't object on the basis of the historical evidence. They don't want that path or that path's going to be inconvenient, but really want to work with landowners. There's no point, from a walker's perspective, just going through somebody's garden if there's a path that's just a garden round the corner. It started with the first concept of owning land, which was absolutely not some universal human idea. Then, ultimately, the feudal system and the idea of all belonging to the monarch, which is a very rare point in history."
30,Why some remastered music videos look awful,"In 2019, a load of music videos that had been uploaded to YouTube in the early days of the platform were remastered. YouTube let the music labels keep the same video IDs, along with all the views and comments, so suddenly, all those old videos were in HD! And they look... well, it depends on the video. Smash Mouth's All Star looks awful. Now, there are some brilliant remasters out there. Wham!'s Last Christmas is now in 4K, and it looks spectacular. And that's because it was shot on film, full cinema quality, the sort of thing you can literally project on the side of a building and it will look great. Same with Freddie Mercury's Living On My Own, the remaster looks stunning. In fact, I think that looks better, because they haven't converted it to widescreen: they've kept it at the ""aspect ratio"" of old '80s television. And look, I can see why record companies would want an HD version of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's iconic. It has over a billion views on YouTube. But this was not shot onFilm. It was recorded on TV cameras, edited on videotape. And by the look of the effects, these effects required live feedback to the camera. There was never any high-quality film version, this was only ever in standard definition."
31,Why this British crossroads was so dangerous,"Two cyclists have died in the last ten years in near-identical crashes. Both times, a driver failed to stop and hit a cyclist who had right-of-way. This junction is at the worst possible angle. Speed bumps or a chicane on the approach would solve the problem. But it's not legal to have those unless you also have street lighting. The best solution is to stagger the crossing, to curve the two side roads so they meet the main road at right angles, force the drivers to slow down. But locals, and a budget estimated at around £100,000, would be the cheapest and easiest way to solve it. But road safety shouldn't require faith in human nature, and anyone's safety,  should be based on nature. The research for this article started with this video, so I've put a link in the description, please do go and read it. Thank you to Bez, whoever you are for this research!

32,Why dark video is a terrible mess,"In most modern digital video, there is a grand total of about 16.7 million possible colours. For a modern screen, you need eight bits for each pixel, so you've got 256 shades each of red, green, and blue. But at full resolution, this video is 1,920 pixels wide, and there are only 256 shades of green. Even if I have a green gradient across the whole video, even if you use every single shade of pure green that's possible on this format, then you're still going to have a colour band every seven or eight pixels. And if everything's much darker than that.. suddenly you only might have half a dozen different shades of Green available across the entire picture. And the third reason is that raw HD video needs compression, then that will happen in a real-life scene, and the natural light and noise in the sensor will do that for you. Instead of going from one colour to another at a line, you can use dithering, which can make the other boundary appear fuzzy, so that from a distance the other colour doesn't look like that. And finally, we have colour banding. If we take a sample of the bright gradient behind me and massively increase the contrast, we can see it's there… but normally, it's invisible. And that’s because while the absolute difference between two bands is still the same, the relative difference is tiny."
33,Why you can't buy Dasani water in Britain,"Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water was launched in the UK in 2004. It was the first and last time that you could ever buy Dasani water in Britain. The story of why it failed here is one of the greatest marketing disaster stories in history. But the story is a little more complicated than a lot of the world thought. And it starts years earlier, with an episode of 'Only Fools and Horses' In 1992, Del Boy tried to sell tap water from South London as ""Peckham Spring"" bottled water. Now, under UK law, ""mineral water"" is a protected term. Mineral water must come from a certified underground spring, it must not be chemically treated in any way, and is generally under heavy regulation. Back in 2004, the perception was that bottled water meant mineral water. Why else would you buy it? It's something you can't get at home. In fact, Coca-Cola never said they had done taste-testing and refining the mineral balance and flavour of the water, making a version of Dasani that was ideal for the British palate. There were occasional rough patches for the launch, like shopkeepers in Buxton complaining about being forced by their local water-Cola contracts to replace their local bottles of mineral water with Dasani."
34,How Neurosurgeons Navigate Inside The Brain,"The brain is packed with almost 100 billion neurons compartmentalised into complex bundles of nerves and other structures that make you who you are. Small parts of your brain are vital for allowing you to speak, move, think, learn and love. Neurosurgeons can use infrared and electromagnetic image guidance systems to show us exactly where we are in the brain during critical operations like brain tumour surgery, or inserting biopsy needles deep into the brain. The system can track instruments either optically using an infrared camera or electromagnetically. With optical tracking, this camera sends out and then detects infrared light that's reflected from these silver balls. With electromagnetic tracking, the emitter emits a low energy magnetic field with unique characteristics at every point. The software then displays the instrument's position on either the CT or MRI scan of that patient. We're going to be using a pre made hole or trapdoor in the skull that's going to allow us to just access the tumour away from the skull. In real life, this is a 45 minute operation that would take about 45 minutes to an hour, having drilled through the skin and drilled off this bone and operate around this tumour. This is quite cool because it actually has fluid systems within it and you can actually see it and move it."
35,I visited the US National Helium Reserve,"Helium is not a renewable resource, at least not on any human timescale. It's not a fossil fuel, but it is made very slowly by radioactive decay deep down in the ground. Once it's pulled up from the ground, used, and dispersed into the atmosphere, it is ludicrously expensive to recover. But there's still approximately 80 to 100 years' worth of known helium reserves in the United States, in Wyoming. There's still a lot of helium available and new helium sources are being found. With the price of helium, there's so much conservation going on now that there's actually a very small market for party balloons. I'm a real fan of party balloons, but I am glad that we have my preference for my balloons, so much so that I'm not using them now that the price is so much higher than it was a few years ago. And researchers are often having trouble finding enough money to keep their experiments going. And yes, it's why filling party balloons is getting really expensive. We are now in the final two years of our program and facing the last part of our privatization effort. By the year 2021, we will be stepping out of the helium activity and transferring it to private entities. Surprisingly enough, the question comes up whether or not we should be using party balloons at all."
36,The elevator shaft was invented before the elevator,"The world's first elevator shaft was installed in the Cooper Union Foundation Building in New York City in 1855. The shaft was the first time a building was constructed to have a space for an elevator top to bottom. The only thing nobody knew was what would be the shape of the elevator cab, and Peter Cooper bet on circular. Given what hassle a round elevator shaft turned out to be, was it worth it? Or would it have been better to wait and then retrofit a regular elevator in later, like every other building from that era? And here's a bigger question: What should we be designing for now? What's the thing that is going to seem obvious in 20 or 30 years but no one can see coming now? Maybe. I don't know. Maybe we should do it now, says architect John Hejduk, who designed the shaft in the 1950s and '60s for the Foundation Building, a radical, progressive institution. The building was renovated, really, from top tobottom on the inside in 1975. It was literally a square peg in a round hole. Always thought that that was a beautiful way to allow architecture to speak across time. And so, we think, worldwide, certainly in the city, but it was not the first functioning elevator."
37,Why Helsinki's library robots aren't important,"Oodi, the new Helsinki Central Library, has three mobile robots that move books around. The library also has 3D printers and laser cutters, music studios and a kitchen. It has been said that it's like a living room for citizens, with a movie theatre and VR classes. Most libraries don't have robots, but every library does have librarians.

38,What counts as the world's shortest river?,"The Roe River in Montana is the shortest river in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. It runs from a crystal-clear spring in Giant Springs State Park, flowing down 61 metres until it joins the Missouri River flowing to the ocean. There have been long-documented arguments about whether this river is even the shortest in the United States......and there are international claims too, like this short channel between two lakes near Jyväskylä in Finland. It is a large, natural channel flowing in one direction to a lake. Fits all the dictionary definitions, unless you want to argue that it's not large enough, but frankly if it's large enough to drown in, I think it should count. You could try adding more specifics. All the categories that we try to put the natural world into, to fit everything into maps and databases, all those categories have to be fuzzy. Mapmakers have known for years that, as with so many things in the real world, ""is it a river"" is not always a question that can be answered with a binary 'yes' or 'no' There is almost always an exception to the  rule. The 'river' is whatever humans agree it is. The exact definition probably differs between languages and cultures anyway."
39,Flying a plane with fireworks on the wings,"Aerosparx attach pyrotechnics to planes so they can produce a fireworks show in mid-flight. They can display from up to 300,000 people, to a million people. Planning is in our display, so we go in circles, mimicking our mind and physically mimicking the manoeuvres that we're then going to do in the sky. One of the big wows is flying in extremely close formation, so your peripheral vision is just full of aeroplane. Our choice of fireworks was a Grob 109 motorglider, as far as we could go and we needed as far and we could not find one that was as good as the one we were using in the UK. We can fire 24 separate fireworks in our show. You can't get 24 right in a sequence. So we've actually had a bespoke computer system designed, and not only does it fire our fireworks for us, but it also controls the LED light system on the aeroplanes. And that means I now have only one button. So once I've pressed it once, it then auto-sequences onto the next part of the programmes. My imagination, I've found over the years, has always been a leapfrog ahead of the authorities' regulation. Not trying to stop what we're doing, but finding out where it fits into regulations that were written, quite genuinely, not for aerplanes."
40,How to stop a colossal bridge corroding,"The Humber Bridge opened in 1981 and is the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Nearly 40 years after it opened, this bridge is about a third of the way through its design lifespan. Inspections in the United States demonstrated that moisture was still penetrating and gathering in the main cables and causing significant corrosion. So, the Humberside Bridge Board first inspected their main cables in 2009, and then deployed dehumidification the following year, 2010. Here we are, 10 years later in 2019, reinspecting the main cable to ascertain the effectiveness of that de Humidification system. With 100-ton hydraulic jacks in each corner, we compress the cable back to its original diameter. The idea that the wires are slightly corroded could be worrying, but it's well, well within design tolerances, and it's been noticed early and dealt with, and they're keeping a watch on them just in case. We're for the drone shot? We're going to go for a little drone shot right now! We're right for the shot! We should be able to make it to the other side of the world in a few years, and we'll be back to show you how it all works. We'll be on the ground in a matter of hours."
41,Mr Olds' remarkable elevator,"The Olds Elevator is a vertical screw conveyor used in factories around the world for lifting and moving bulk powder or grain or sand. It's a more accurate volumetric feeder than a lot of the devices that are being used. The clearance between the inside of the rotating tube and the screw allows product to go through it and not be damaged, not crushed. With this elevator, it's a full flow. And there's no movement of air, virtually, except what might be between the particles of sand. Only where it falls back through the open air. This is also a very important thing where you're handling dusty explosive materials. Corn dust is highly explosive. Sugar. Big explosion in the USA a few years back and it demolished a refinery. The Olds is a good way of lifting bulk stuff through the 20th century, through automation and automation. It did no one earlier, how one spot of industrialization and automation did this one earlier? I don't understand, how this one spot did this earlier, but I am trying to not make this be infomercial. And yeah, this is being used all over the world now, from food handling to solar power towers, from solar power to food handling. And I checked, and yeah, the next one, and the next ones do the same thing."
42,The brain-eating amoebas of Kerosene Creek,"The brain-eating amoeba can be found in hot pools and things like that. The organisms enter the nose if you put your head under or you snort the water in. They can then go from the nose through the olfactory nerves to the brain. Once in the brain they start to eat the neurons and astrocytes. The last case we had in New Zealand was, I think, in 2000. It starts sometimes with a change in your sense of smell, sense of taste. And then that can progress to headaches, vomiting, fever, and then ultimately to seizures and death. But despite the terrifying name, the grisly stories, and the 90-something percent chance of death if you're infected, infection is really rare. There will be things that we're doing in our daily lives that are way more dangerous than this, even from a microbial point of view. We are covered in microbes. Maybe one in three, one in four people will have staph aureus living up their nose. Pretty fine up there, but if you get that in your bloodstream you can end up with horrible infection. You're more at risk, frankly, from shoving your finger up your nose and then touching a cut accidentally than you are from having your brain eaten."
43,"Where two oceans meet, debunked","Cape Reinga, at the very northern tip of New Zealand's North Island, is one of the few places in the world where you can watch two oceans collide. Here, at least, you can see the waves from the Tasman Sea coming in from the west and clashing with the Pacific Ocean waves. But this is just one very, very small bit of the ocean with waves that look messy on a human scale because of the land nearby. The official limits of oceans and seas are defined by the International Hydrographic Organisation, and those standards are arbitrary lines designed to make sure that everyone can agree on what’s where. Those lines are nothing to do with the position of any ocean currents. And according to those standards, the Tasmania Sea meets the Pacific at North Cape, a closed nature reserve about two kilometres that way. This is just a windy bit of rock with a lighthouse and a road. That doesn’t mean you shouldn't come here, though. Cape ReingA is beautiful, it’ll be part of the local mythology, and it�’re worth the trip. But when they say it”s where two oceans meet… that just isn’ts quite true. It's not even where the Tasmansea ends and the Pacific begins."
44,How Auto-Tune Works,"A pure tone is a vibration of air back and forth at a certain frequency. Pitch correction, or auto-tune, is clever. When it changes a note that someone's not quite sung correctly, it changes the speed of the vibrations, but it also adds or removes some vibrations so the duration stays the same. Because musical notes don't sound like this: [tone] They sound like   ♫ Hello! ♫ ♫Hello... ♉ ♉ Hello~ ♉ Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between, the Gregory Brothers.

45,How to slow down a stock exchange,"High-frequency trading sees computers trading on a stock exchange faster than any human ever could. The faster they react, the more money they can make, so companies have spent billions on moving their equipment closer to or even inside the exchange. When everyone's bought the same expensive advantage, no one's in the lead. IEX is now a fully-fledged stock exchange, so a lot of people obviously know names like New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. We're regulated and established the exact same way as those stock exchanges. We can take in all that data, we can make a determination on what the fairest price is, and as long as someone is not 350 microseconds faster than us, we will always have the clearest snapshot of what the true price is in the market. The biggest proponent of delay is something called propagation delay. Just means the further away you are from the signal, the longer it takes you to get it. So we said, why don't we introduce distance? 350 micro seconds is 61 kilometres. We called up a fiber-optic provider, and we asked them to coil cable for us. This is actually 38 miles of cable. It looks like three big fishing spools, so anyone who wants to trade on our exchange has to come in and traverse this distance. The high-frequency guys can be fast, and that's totally fine with them being fast, but because physics is physics, they'll never be 350 micro Seconds faster than me."
46,This Is Your Brain On Stale Air,"Kurtis Baute is filmed from inside his homemade, airtight biodome. Carbon dioxide levels are going to go up. They could even reach 6,95 parts per million by the end of the century. The good news is that we have the ability to change the environments that we live in in terms of the climate and the air we breathe. You can get some plants in your house that are up-to-date and functioning, and then you can use that air to breath and then use that breath to make a difference to your overall health and well-being. If you want to make your own biodome, you can go out and open a window in your office or your home and fill it up with air from the plants. You don't have to be rich to do it, but you don't want to live in an environment that is too toxic for you or your family to survive in, either. Do not try this at home. It is... Just don't try it at home, [laughing] I wanna step back 60 years ago to when carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere were around 300. Modern day, because of industrialization and burning fossil fuels, those levels are now around 400. And in urban environments, it's more like 500. But the thing is, we spend most of our time indoors."
47,How Knot To Hang A Painting,"Jade Tan-Holmes shows you the same puzzle and then solves it with maths. You have a painting, a piece of string, and two pins stuck in a wall. Can you hang the painting in such a way so that if you remove either one of the pins the painting falls? The thing to focus on here is how to tie the string around the pins, not any of the physics of the objects. So there are a few different ways to solve this puzzle. But we're going to do the one which takes us through knot theory. Knot theory is the mathematical study of tangled systems. As this is a problem about tangling things together, chances are knot theory will come in handy. The crossings are the only things we have control over and are the key to unlocking the puzzle. If we organise the crossings we can reason much more clearly about the knot. We keep coming back to where we started until we've got the puzzle solved. We just created something called a braid diagram to keep track of the crossings while getting rid of all the unnecessary information. When the lines representing our strings are called strands, the lines represent the positions when the strand in one position crosses over the one in the other. When two strands in two positions in one, one, and three, when the strands are in two, and one, we can label the position."
48,The Fishermen That Hold Their Breath For 10 Minutes,"Diving world champions can stay underwater for one or two hours. How do they do it? Some you can actually take advantage of by channelling your inner dolphin. The reason that this steak is red is a protein called myoglobin, which is found in the muscles of pretty much every mammal and it's responsible for storing oxygen. If we were tucking into a steak that came from a seal it would be almost black in appearance because they've got ten times more myoglobin than humans or cows. This is not a human steak. The problem with proteins is that when they g[child burbles] The problem With proteins is th[child drums] That's the wrong video. I've not tried this. I don't know how long I was under water.

49,"Why NASA Spun Astronauts Around, But Doesn't Any More","The Multi-Axis Trainer is a spinny thing that astronauts get strapped into. It spins on three different axes and three different rings. While you're riding the MAT, you don't spin in more than one direction twice in a row. It's based off of something called the MASTIF, which was used during the Mercury programme. The MAT was never used to actually train astronauts. We only use it as a simulator here at Space Camp. I like to say that most people don't get dizzy, because there are some people who do. I'm one of them! I completely forgot to do the outro. Could we go again, please? If you're good. [groans] Oh, there we go. Thank you very much to all the team at Space camp. You can find out more about them at the links on screen or in the description. [laughs] Yeah, I'm done. I am very much done. For me, it's a little bit easier. For the rest of you, you can read more about the MAT at the link on the screen or the description at the bottom of the page. It looks really fun, or really terrifying, depending on how close you are to it. But what does it actually do? You ready? No! Eyes open."
50,The other tree that owns itself,"The Tree That Owns Itself has had a Wikipedia article since 2006. In the city of Eufaula, just over the border into Alabama, there is another oak tree with a nearly-identical story. The tree in Georgia is in a big college town, home to the University of Georgia, and home to students who will arrive from out of town, learn the story, and then leave. While it's a really pretty city, it has a fraction of the population and no big reason for out-of-towners to visit. Stories don't tend to spread as well from places like this. But if you want a metaphor for how success on the internet and, heck, anywhere works, then these trees are it: it's not always about how good your story is. It's about how many people are willing and able to pass it on. The original one fell in the 1940s and was replaced. And when the tree eventually fell in a storm, a new one was put here, and everyone just agreed that it counted as the same tree. For some reason, that one has better publicity. Maybe it's because that one was first, by about a century, but given that both of them were deeded decades before the internet, I'm not sure that's too much of an advantage."
51,Britain's largest battery is actually a lake,"Dinorwig Power Station is one of the largest power stations of its type in the world. At full load, we can be meeting the demand of around about two million homes. It was built to take advantage of the peaks and troughs in the electricity market. It has the capacity to be able to go from zero up to its full capacity, maybe 2,000 megawatts, within 10 to 30 seconds. The importance of pumped storage is that we can use it to help the National Grid balance supply and demand instantaneously on a second-by-second basis. The current environment that we're in means that having storage is an important component of the modern grid system.

52,Why do London's manholes keep exploding?,"About once or twice a month on average, somewhere in London, a bit of pavement just goes... boomf. The easy answer to why London's pavements keep exploding... well, it would be ""electrical faults"" But an electrical fault won't make an explosion. If electricity goes somewhere it shouldn't, then the circuit breakers that control the grid will detect that and shut it off right away. A steady, slow gas leak in a pipe might not be detected for a while, and in that time the gas can spread a long distance through narrow underground tunnels. So if you've got gas in a tight underground space where it can't expand, and an electrical spark to set it off... well that's all we're doing here: under that cover there is a fuel source, not enough room for it to expand and something to make a spark. That's all you need for an explosion, and it looks like it could do serious damage. But even this dramatised explosion, made with the help of a pyrotechnician, ""this worst-case-scenario... is actually not that bad. ""I tried to do the 'cool guys don't look at explosions' shot, ""and when you take away all this style..."" Fire in the hole."
53,᚛ᚈᚑᚋ ᚄᚉᚑᚈᚈ᚜ and ᚛ᚑᚌᚐᚋ᚜,"Ogham is a way of writing down the early Irish language with marks like these. Each character is made of one to five markings, which will all be on one side of the line. Ogham became the only language in Unicode where a space is not a space. It can be replaced with a line break, the same as in English. There's been an actual argument about it, down in one of the mailing lists for linguists and computer science nerds at the Unicode Consortium. The Irish contingent had some very strong opinions. And the final ruling: yep, that's a space that's also a line. It's also an exception to a rule that I never even realised there was even a. A rule is an ancient script carved into stones more than a millennium ago, and it's a rule I love about linguistics: I never realised that there was a rule to be a space, even though I knew it was there. I love it. I'm a linguist, and I love the rules of linguistics. I just love the exceptions to the rules. I like to be able to make up my own mind about things. I don't like it when people try to force me to accept what I think I'm already comfortable with. I.e. the rule that a space must be empty had never been broken."
54,Wingwalking used to be a lot more dangerous,"In the 1920s, wing-walking was an incredibly dangerous stunt. Now there are still a very small number of folks in the world who do it. The main difference when having someone on the wing is that there is a significant amount of drag from that person. It's a bit like flying an aircraft with your gear and flaps down. You'll need more power to fly and you need to check the trim as well, because the people on the Wing provide a forward centre of gravity. That is exhausting. That's one of the most physically strenuous things I think I've ever done. It is like resistance training, it's really hard work. You have about a month of intense training. You practise everything on the ground first and then you just go up in the air and do it repetitively. You fly everyday, all day, so it's absolutely knackering. At Eastbourne Airshow, we take off from an airfield near Brighton and we fly along the coast for 20 minutes and then they climb up onto the wing, so they climbed up in flight. Usually, we do the rolls and we go upside down because they can't quite believe that we're strapped on. From the air, you can't see our wire. So it's all a bit of an illusion, and they're like, ""Oh my gosh!"""
55,Your private messages travel under this beach,"Under the Porthcurno Beach ran the original telegraph cables linking Britain with her Empire. These cables were fearsomely expensive to make and to lay and the last thing you needed is some idiot dropping an anchor on them or snagging them in their nets. So, 15,000 tonnes of granite was blasted out from the cliff and the whole thing was moved underground. One of those cables, called FLAG, goes all the way from under this beach here to Japan. It can carry up to 100 gigabytes of data every second. And it's just one of many that land somewhere in this part of Britain. The fact that there's also several buildings owned by the British Intelligence Services around here is not a coincidence. So the next time you're in a group chat with people all over the world or video calling someone on another continent, just take a moment and remember that there is a beach with your conversation literally flashing underneath it. It's a good idea to remember that when they're sending a message to someone in another country, it's getting bounced up to a satellite and back down. It takes half a second for a signal to get beamed up to them and backdown. The route around the surface of the earth is much shorter and much faster and it doesn't involve blasting something into orbit."
56,How the 90s VHS look works,"VHS has very muted colour because more information is dedicated to the black-and-white information or the luminance part of the image. VHS is an analog format, it's storing patterns on a magnetic tape, and that means that copies aren't bit-perfect. There are things like what we call the pop lines, when you are recording tape and you get pieces of dust or debris or whatever stuck to the tape and it rolls across the scan head, that one line will create a streak across the screen, and then there's also a scrolling wrinkle. ""Coming up later, Captain Disillusion is going around in circles, ""but next, a programme chosen for you by the Algorithm. ""And there's more from Tom at the same time next week.

57,We Should Let Some Wildfires Burn,"British Columbia has had record-breaking temperatures, droughts, and fire seasons. The Elaho wildfire in 2015 burned an area the size of Manhattan over 10 weeks. In 2017, 19 wildfires combined together to burn an area 130km end-to-end. In absence of fires, the fuels have built up in the forests and now, when we have fires, they're even more intense than they were in the past. The idea that fire could be a good thing is counterintuitive. But it turns out that having a professional set a precise fire at a precise time and place could actually be aGood idea. And you're starting a channel soon called? Destruction by Gravity. There's not much there yet, but check it out. I think there's gonna be some fun stuff. Thank you to you, thank you also to Dr. Lori Daniels at UBC. A lot of fun, I liked it. I'm sorry, I didn't get to meet you all in person, but I'll be back in a week or so with a new episode of Stargate SG-1, which is set to air on Sunday, September 16. I hope you'll join me.

58,The sourtoe cocktail has a human toe in it,"The Sourtoe Cocktail is a shot of liquor, at least 40%, and a human toe in it. The toe must not enter the mouth or be bitten, chewed, or God forbid, swallowed, or it's a $2,500 fine. The toes we receive from donors, mostly anonymous, but we actually have a gentleman over in the UK right now who ran the Yukon ultra-marathon over the winter, got frostbite, and decided, you know what? Might as well put these frostbitten, removed toes to good use. The health inspector gives us the okay to do it. It used to be that it could be done in anything from milk to pop to champagne to beer. Now that summer's coming on, it can get pretty busy. We can do upwards of 50, 60, 70 a night. Up to now, we are at 77,888, but that's since June 11, 1995. This toe started in 1973, so the number could be 100,000. It's just like having a bit of beef jerky in there that's being used as a garnish. But, I know what you're here for. Yes? Are you ready? I am ready. You better be. Here goes, pour out the liquor."
59,How planes stay safe over the Atlantic,"North Atlantic tracks are the airways that we develop each day for our eastbound aircraft who fly across from us over to the UK area. The westbound tracks are produced by our counterpart over in Scotland via Prestwick Centre. The tracks can look curved and inefficient on the flat map projections we're used to but you've got to remember, they're great circle routes. They're the shortest, and cheapest way around the globe of the earth. And also, the tracks are three dimensional. As soon as an aircraft gets too tight to another aircraft, we interject and say, okay, we need to slow you down, or speed you up, traffic permitting obviously, right? If a plane has an emergency, they have contingency procedures. They have their TCAS. TCAS is their Traffic Collision Avoidance System. You can find out more about the tracks and the description of them at the Gander Area Control Centre. Thank you very much to everyone at Nav Canada, for being the number one thing that being here is one of the most important things we can do to keep you all safe and well. We're looking forward to working with you again in the coming months and years, and I hope to see you all again in a year or two. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from."
60,Making an international standard cup of tea," ISO 3103 is meant to make an okay but reproducible cup of tea. You measure out 2g of tea per 100ml of water, plus or minus 2%. So for this, that means 2.8g, plus and minus.05g. You combine that with either local or standardised water depending on what you're testing. And then you drink it not from the traditional cup, but from the bowl. There is a separate standard, ISO 1839, on how you actually sample it, and what you report. And it tastes, er... (slurps) Tastes okay. It's just okay. But as far as I can tell, this is the first International Standard Cup of Tea on the internet. But it doesn't matter: there is no perfect cup of Tea: there's only the right one for you. This here? This isn't perfect, it definitely isn'tperfect, but as faras I can tells, this isn't Perfect. But close enough. It tastes okay, but close enough, so I'm not getting involved in that debate. And if you're adding milk, you should put it in first, but this is green tea, so... No, I can't. I don't actually like tea. But hey, that's the standard."
61,How formation flying works,"The Red Arrows are the best aerobatic team anywhere in the world. They fly at hundreds of miles an hour just metres apart from each other. How is it possible to safely fly this close and perform manoeuvres this precise? Part of it is training, trust, and talent, but part is a skill that you probably already know, keeping your distance from the car in front when you're driving on a highway. It's just that instead of working in one dimension, these pilots are working in three. Or, if you count time, maybe even four. The actual art of formation flying, in itself, is reasonably straight forward. But it's also about timing. So we're trying to, as the Red Arrows, make it look like we're one wing that's moving beautifully in graceful formation. And to do that, the guys who are furthest away from me as the leader need to know when I'm going to turn. I expect them to have already started putting their inputs if they're along way away. If they don't, they're behind the time and it's going to look like a broken chair. Every formation shape and every formation position has a different route to get out of that formation quickly and safely enough. They're what we call the escape strategies, but every manoeuvre is different."
62,European clocks ran slow for a bit. British clocks didn't.,"Clocks over in Europe have lost six minutes over the last month. The problem is politics. Serbia and Kosovo have fallen out with each other. Kosovo is low on power, Serbia isn't helping manage it, and as a result the entire European grid has been slightly underpowered since the middle of January. So clocks like this, who are expecting 50... okay, it doesn't sound like much, but it works out to them losing six minutes. Fortunately for me, I don't have to worry about it. As I'm sure 52% of Britons will be ecstatic to hear, the mainland European grid is not synchronised to the British National Grid here. It is connected, through two undersea cables, one under the English Channel from France, and the other one from the Netherlands, landing right here, on the Isle of Grain, which is near... nowhere. But these cables are direct current cables, not alternating current. They doesn't require grid synchronisation. So while mainland Europe's grid is slow, our British grid is going at 50 British cycles a second, as Her Majesty intended. [Music stops] The clocks may be going slow all over Europe, but here in Britain, our teasmades are boiling precisely on schedule. And god help us all."
63,The moiré effect lights that guide ships home,"This light is based on moiré patterns, which are the extra lines and patches that seem to appear when you have two similar but slightly different patterns overlaid on each other. If you're looking straight at that light, dead on, you see parallel lines. But if you're to either side, the arrows tell you which way to go to be straight-on to it. You can have five different boats in five different locations out there, all looking at the same sign, and they will all see arrows pointing the right way for them, without any computers or fancy tracking. This seems like such a good idea that I couldn't believe it wasn't well-known. It looked like a bit of weird maritime history that had been a brief fad and then died out, leaving no trace. It's a really weird use for a very expensive light. So if anyone out there knows, for sure, with evidence... do get in touch with me. I don't know why it here? I don’t know. But it's genius and, yeah, I wanted to understand it. I kept coming back, I kept searching. And eventually, I started looking through patent databases. And after a few minutes, I found it. It was patented by Lars Bergkvist and Ivan Forsen, from Sweden, in the late 1970s."
64,Canada's Most Successful King,"On Rare Earth, we like to take symbols from a country that maybe you've not been to yet and show how they fit into the bigger picture of your own life. This week we look at Canada's 10th Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. He was a sexually repressed, hypocritical, guilt-ridden, prostitute-visiting mama's boy. But despite his faults, King was a political mastermind. He's a good example of how you don't have to be great at being a person to be a great politician. What drives someone to become a politician? To me it always seemed like such a terrible job. Nobody likes you, and it really doesn't   make as much money as it seems. It's kind of like being a dentist with bad pay. But there is something you get as a politician that you can get unlike almost anywhere else, and that's a legacy. He believed that his dreams were divine and he followed them with his life. And if it took ruling the entire country to do so, that's what he was gonna do. In the mid-1800s, Mackenzie was obsessed with his grandfather, also named William Lyon King, just without the King, which is a joke in itself. So you get it, you know no name in the mid-'1800s with the name Mackenzie, no name for the monarchy."
65,A Language Made Of Music,"Solresol was invented in the mid-19th century by a French musician named Jean-François Sudre. His goal was to create a language that was bound to no particular country. He broke all the words up into seven groups, called keys, based on their first syllable. At four syllables, he takes this concept to a whole new level. Solresol went up to 4 syllables with less than 3000 total words, but the main set is related to the main theme of the channel. To quote Paul Collins, ""SolresOL is at the heart of an idealic effort – an idealist and philanthropicist – at least in certain circles"" 12tone is a channel about music theory that uses pen and paper, and piano notes, and doodles of elephants, but today they are also talking about language. For the first time ever, this week's guest video uses art and animation. 12tone: [beeps]! Hey, welcome to 12tone! Or, to put that another way: [piano notes]! Ok, that may have sounded like a nice but strange melody, but it was actually a sentence in La Langue Musicale Universelle, or the Universal Musical Language, also known as SolresOL."
66,Sign Language Isn't Universal,"This week's guest is Rikki Poynter, a deaf vlogger who makes videos in both English and American Sign Language. There are about more than 300 sign languages in the entire world. While sign language isn’t exactly universal, there is this thing called  International Sign or IS. This is typically used in big events where deaf people from all over gather. Go subscribe to Rikki's channel! And remember, she's a vloggers: that is a channel about her life, not just ""all your sign language questions answered""! I figure I should set expectations there. Next week, a video that's a little bit related but also a littlebit musical. I hope you all learned something new today.

67,The null hypothesis,"Fly Your Thesis program aims to see if brain-computer interfaces can be used for very extreme situations, such as space. In the flights, the participants are going to play a game called ""shoot-the-alien"" and they'll do so with their brain activity. We're not actually reading someone's mind but we're measuring their brain signals. In a few decades, could astronauts doing space walks use their minds to control equipment? I'm not going to tell you. You can look it up when they all publish their papers because the achievement is the same, regardless of the results. If you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and you want to be one of the people behind me, then have a look at the Fly Your Theses program. The link is in the description of the program, or you can go to flyyourthesis.org.uk to find out more about the program and how you can get a share of the proceeds. For more information, visit flyyourthesis.org or go to www.flyyourthesiope.com. For the BrainFly team, that is: is our brain activity comparable in zero G? Can you still use a brain- computer interface if you're in orbit?"
68,Batman's village of fools,"In the early 13th century, King John wanted to travel through this town. The locals were worried that if the King travelled on a road, it would become a public highway, and they didn’t want that. So the full legend tells the tale of a wily group of people who outwitted the King… but who also became known as a village of fools in the process. They were both the Wise Men of Gotham and the Mad men of Gotham. Centuries later, in the early 1800s, there was an American writer called Washington Irving. He was a satirist, and in one of his early works he refers to New York City as Gotham. More than a century after that, when comic book writer Bill Finger was looking for a name for Batman’s fictional town, he spotted “Gotham Jewellers”, and thought: that’S perfect. So now we have Gotham City. If one link in that chain had broken, through 13th-century legend, to 16th- century insult book, to 19th- Century writer, to 20th- centuries phone book flip, if one of those small events hadn”t happened, Batman would live somewhere else. Back then, ""madness"" was thought to be contagious. The king stayed away, and the locals won."
69,Hold music used to sound better. Here's why.,"Early telephone calls were put through by a human operator. Any sound at one end, whether it's speech, music, whatever, would be converted to an electrical signal, sent down the wire, and converted back at the other end. Phone companies realised that they could save on setting up thousands of wires between exchanges miles apart if they were able to put several conversations down one wire at the same time. So rather than transmit every frequency of sound in the original signal, they would cut off the high and low frequencies, and then they would shift each call into a different frequency band. But music can't survive that chain. It's already been compressed by a completely different system as your call bounces around a company’s internal phone network. The standards for phone calls, even today, rely on quick-and-dirty compression built decades ago, designed to run on very little computing power, and optimised for speech. That compression is great at encoding one clear voice -but chuck a load of complicated music at it, with all its instruments and it's going to sound bad. But not quite enough to break down into static. There is one last piece of the puzzle. Someone else cutting corners. And in a really badly designed system, maybe there’t an entire third layer of terrible compression from whichever other company runs the call centre that you're actually talking to, off in some other country."
70,"What Is Sea Level, Anyway?","Calipatria has the lowest elevation in the western hemisphere, 55 metres below sea level. If it wasn't for all the mountains and hills between here and the Pacific Ocean, then we'd be wet, but that flag would stay dry. We're dry because no rivers drain into this basin. The Salton Sea over there only exists because some engineers screwed up in 1905 and diverted a good bit of the Colorado River in there for a couple of years. That water is steadily getting saltier and more polluted as it slowly evaporates, and California's got to deal with that over the next couple of decades. But how do we know we're 55 metresbelow sea level? What isSea level? In theory, it is the average height of the sea around the Earth. But there are some problems with that. The Earth isn't one uniform lump of rock. Bits of the mantle are more dense than others, so gravity isn't quite the same everywhere on Earth's surface. And by a bit more, I mean anything up to 80 metres more. And to complicate things even more, mountains are big enough that their gravity attracts the ocean, just a little. These aren't small amounts, that could be the difference between this city being above and below sealevel."
71,The centuries-old debt that's still paying interest,"In 1648, the Water Board of Lekdijk Bovendams needed to repair embankments to make sure that this bit of the Netherlands didn't flood. For that, they needed money, so they sold a bearer bond. Unlike modern bonds, they didn't set a time limit on that. 3½ centuries later, that original bond ended up.... here, at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, and it's still paying interest. Now, the Dutch water authority could probably default on the debt if they wanted to. It costs more than the bond is worth to fly someone over every couple of decades. And let's face it, Yale would be unlikely to launch an international lawsuit. But, for about one Euro a month, the water Authority gets to be part of a weird bit of living financial history, and get a bit of good publicity out of it too. It might not be a subscription they'd take out deliberately, but apparently, for them, it's worth it. I think they have a pretty good track record. They sound like a triple-A organisation to me, and I think we're going to be good for a while. The value of this bond, obviously, is in the fact that it's live. It's probably just as exciting for them as it is for us to be able to present the bond and have an opportunity to pay interest."
72,The US government will sell you freeze-dried urine,"The National Institute of Standards and Technology produces Standard Reference Materials. SRMs are characterised materials that customers use to make sure their measurements on their materials and processes are accurate and reliable. NIST has more than 1,000 reference materials, including freeze-dried urine, whale blubber and space beads. They are used by people around the world to calibrate and test machinery, including machines that test for drugs and toxic elements. The Institute will sell you urine laced with exact amounts of the metabolites of cannabis or cocaine, or they're testing for poisons and toxic Elements. It takes us years to procure a new material that becomes an SRM a couple of years later. We buy industrial products directly. It comes from a different source each time, but we make it the same way, and we characterise it in the same fashion. We have to store some of our more sensitive materials in cryocooled conditions. It's just that everything in this warehouse has the US Government stamp of approval on it. It’s just that all of the materials here have to be exactly the same, to an incredibly precise margin, to ensure that what we're measuring is the true value in that particular material. The material itself is not precise. The measurements that characterise the material are precise."
73,What counts as a mountain?,"Mount Evans is the 41st highest mountain in North America. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation defines a mountain as needing 300m of prominence, which is only the height of the Eiffel Tower. Prominence works like this: imagine if you could raise sea level up to where I'm sitting now. How many meters would it have to drop before you could connect this mountain to another, taller one and walk there without getting your feet wet? For Mount Evans, that is 839m down, or about one-fifth of its height above sea level. That observatory summit? It's not prominent. Sure, you have to walk downhill from it, but after a few meters you're going uphill again. It's a mess. Even after researching this, I'm not sure about it. Even the folks I asked to check my script went, ""eh, well, I guess, basically, but technically..."" This is one of those times that the human need to categorise and catalogue everything runs up against messy reality. There are always edge cases, and pretty much every mountain is an edge case. I'm going to go back down now before I get altitude sickness(!) And that's a mountain. And that isn't. But in formal terms, we solve it by measuring prominence."
74,I can't show you how pink this pink is.,"Artist Stuart Semple has created what he calls the Pinkest Pink. The colour is so intense your screen can't display it properly. Semple created the pinkest pink, the greenest green, the loveliest blue, and the yellowest yellow. He also created the world's most glittery natural glitter and the mattest blackest art material in the world. In a few years' time, technology will move on. It's already possible to buy expensive equipment with a wider colour gamut. But in the meantime, I can try and simulate what being here is like. In this shot, this one here, I've digitally adjusted the saturation of this pink so it's not quite as intense. Now if I turn it back up... Imagine that change, but more so. That's how pink this pink is. It is ridiculously pink. Thank you to StuartSemple and all the team at his workshop: pull down the description for more about them, their pigments, and this pink. This pink is gorgeous! I cannot get over how luminous this is. I started out, ""well this isn't doing anything, this is just powder"" and then it just went well. I've been painting since I was five years old, and I've seen a lot of pink. And thousands and thousands of people have used the pink, and nobody's said they'veseen a pinker pink."
75,Why old screens make a ʰᶦᵍʰ ᵖᶦᵗᶜʰᵉᵈ noise,"Video was filmed at the Cambridge Centre for Computing History. There was a subtle high-pitched noise in the background of the video, and I hadn't noticed it before uploading. As you get older, your range of hearing starts to narrow. It starts to get more difficult to hear high frequencies. I can't hear anything higher than 17,000Hz any more. That video I made, was a reminder than I'm getting older. So the next time someone forgets to check for a high pitched noise, and next time it annoys you... well, at least you can still hear it. I have to strain to even notice it, even as some folks in the comments said it was loud enough to stop them watching. And for a while, I was angry with myself, because it was an unforced error. I wasn't under time pressure, I checked through half a dozen times, I just didn't think to check the sound with my eyes. That mistake might have stopped the message getting as far as it could. But it also turns out these headphones that I use to check audio aren't great at high frequencies, and so with my voice drowning it out I didn't notice the sound. Until now, I've been removing it from this video, but let me tell you: it's here, and in this room, with all these monitors on."
76,The Runways of Fire That Let WW2 Planes Land In Fog: FIDO,"RAF used to set up huge lines of petrol burners to heat up the air. The system was called FIDO. “Fog, Intensive, Dispersal Of.” It was never used in peacetime: aircraft could just not take off instead. But for the war effort, to let planes take off for battle in any weather and to save thousands of air crew lives who needed to land right now: it was worth it. A small Fido system burne 70,000 gallons of fuel an hour. One estimate says that in one foggy night over England, all the Fido systems in use would burn 20 million gallons offuel. There's even a report all the extra heat pumped into the atmosphere triggered a thunderstorm. At the current price of jet fuel, as I record this, running a FidoSystem would cost about $200,000 per hour per runway. It was a huge expense, but it was well worth it in the 1940s when planes could take off from RAF Graveley and land safely in the UK. The glow from the fires was visible for miles. There was a bit of smoke when they started the system up, but once it got hot, the air could be so clear that people on the ground could see the stars. There are demonstration films taken by the RAF on clear days, showing how big and how visible this was."
77,Why sci-fi alien planets all look the same,"Hollywood is a union town, and long ago, it was negotiated that thirty miles was ""local"" and anything outside wasn't. The headquarters of pretty much all the movie studios are inside the zone. Griffith Park and Bronson Canyon are well within the zone, close to the centre of Hollywood. Vasquez Rocks, which have been used in so many TV shows, films and music videos that there is a separate Wikipedia page just listing them. If those rocks were slightly further away from Hollywood, then who knows? Perhaps Bill and Ted would have been killed by their evil robot doubles somewhere else. But in summary: this thirty-mile zone, this TMZ, and yes, that's where the gossip site got its name from, this border is why, sometimes, it looks like the crew of the Enterprise are boldly going where quite a lot of people have gone before. The rules are complicated, and I couldn't explain them all if I tried. But if I just walk a few paces this way, inside the studio zone, then cast and crew get paid from when they arrive here, from their call time. Filming inside thezone is significantly cheaper. It's where Adam West's Batcave was, along with where the walls fell for Captain Picard, and along with pretty much any American TV show that's ever needed that sort of landscape."
78,Voyager 1's Getting Closer to Earth Right Now,"The Voyager 1 space probe is the furthest man-made object from Earth. But right now, it is moving towards us. Relatively speaking. This is the control room for NASA’s Deep Space Network. Scientists here still listen for the signals that Voyager is sending. Voyager 1 is carrying radioisotope thermoelectric generators, RTGs. It's powered by radioactive decay and will last until around 2025. After that, the craft will go dark, carrying a message forward into interstellar space for… well, we don’t know where, or when, or even who. If there was enough light being bounced off of it, you might be able to see it with a telescope, but it's so far away, and so dim, without a radio signal coming from Voyager at all. And so I think that's pretty much the end, once it goes dark. Thank you very much to all the team at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and here at the Deepspace Network. Pull down the description for more about them, and about their missions. The most important reason for sending the thing out there is to get the science data back. We need to get that data back down and distribute it to the scientists. In terms of checking in with spacecraft, I think with Voyager for example, we probably downlink from them almost every day."
79,Why This “Zero Calorie Sweetener” Isn’t Zero Calories,"Splenda is marketed as a zero-calorie sweetener or a healthy replacement for sugar. To find out if there’s any calories in this packet of Splenda, we have to find out whether there is any glucose in it. Splenda has more glucose in the Splenda than the actual sugar. So, how many calories are in these packets? Four. How do we know that? Well, I emailed Splenda Customer Service. And they wrote back that there are four calories in each single packet. Side note here, one gram of sugar has four calories and each packet is about a gram. But wait a sec, why is Splenda allowed to say they have none? That seems pretty sketchy, but it might seem, but that makes sense here, because that makessense because that is no calorie sweetener because it has no calorieSweetener. Can any food have zero calories? Can any even have that? well, yes. Think of it this way. If you, say, eat plastic, nothing really will happen. Plastic has zero usable calories if you eat it, you can’t take energy from it. This is just an example. It's theoretically possible. But it's not very practical. It’ll take a lot of work."
80,Why Song Translations Usually Suck,"Alex from Play the Mind takes on song translations. There’s a conflict between the meaning of the lyrics and the way they sound when spoken. The phonology of a language is like its musical DNA. It has a primordial influence on how the melody of a song gets written. A song translation can either sound good, but be inaccurate in meaning, or it can be accurate, but sound bad. Next time, we have something in the popular genre of ""that thing you’re eating isn’t what you think it is"". See you then for the next episode of Play The Mind, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4.

81,The Foil That Went To The Moon And Back,"A tiny piece of Kapton foil from Apollo 11 has been put on to a piece of paper. But if you look closely at the piece, you’ll notice that it’s sort of silvery and it looks like it's been scratched off and there’t gold underneath. It’S all part of the thermal protection system. Thermal protection was a huge engineering challenge for the men and woman who designed and built the Apollo spacecraft. It protected the spacecraft from the heat associated with launching through the atmosphere, but it didn't last very long. As it went through the re-entry phase of the mission, a little bit of the golden tape was burned away revealing the golden underside of the spacecraft. But how is it that I’m able to actually own a piece. of Apollo 11? Well, it turns out that recovery crews and pretty much anybody who could get within. within the spacecraft could take a tiny piece off that souvenir as a souvenir. It's all yours. Amy, it's all your. Amy at Vintage Space, who has brought along one of the greatest and also the tiniest props that I have ever seen that I've ever seen, it is Apollo 11's thermal protection shield. It was made of coded aluminium and oxidized silicon monoxide."
82,The Disaster That Changed Engineering: The Hyatt Regency Collapse,"In 1981, the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, hosted a large party in the multi-story atrium area. During the event, suspended walkways on the second and fourth floors collapsed, killing over 100 people and injuring over 200 more. At the time, the accident was the worst structural failure in US history. In the wake of the disaster, investigators discovered a change to the original design of the walkways that was proposed by the fabricator and mistakenly approved by the structural engineer. What, at first glance, seemed like a subtle adjustment to the design, turned out to be the root cause of the failure. There is an implicit handshake between a society and its engineers. We hardly have a choice but to trust that the constructed environment that we live in is safe and sound. When an engineer seals a design, he or she takes responsibility for its accuracy and safety to the general public. But the err is human and that includes engineers. So, we try to develop conventions and processes that can catch and correct from mistakes before they get too far. And that includes studying and learning from errors made in the past. Next time, a guest video with a prop that has been to the moon. Also, he made his own props. Grady, take it away."
83,You Can Hear The Difference Between Hot and Cold Water,"Science presenter Steve Mould shows you how to distinguish between hot and cold water using your sense of hearing. He pours water from identical jugs into identical mugs and it’s your job to figure out which is which. The reason they sound different is because of the fact that the water is viscous and the viscosity of water goes down when you heat it. It should have been quite easy to tell which was which, but here's the answer: the first pour was cold and the second pour was hot. And like many things, this is something that you knew intuitively, even though it wasn’t something you were aware of consciously. Next time, the tale of an engineering disaster.

84,"One Town, Four Elements: Ytterby","In 1792, a chemist named Gadolin received a sample of a mysterious black rock from this now-closed Swedish mine. Gadolin and other chemists found that the black rocks from this mine had not one, but four new elements that were completely unknown to science. And they were all named after here: yttrium, terbium, erbium and ytterbium. This small town in Sweden is the only place in the world with four elements named after it. Canada, Norway, Russia, unlucky. Here, though? Ah, there were discoveries to be made. We've named all the natural elements and we've made our own. But back then, it wasn't just that there were gaps in the periodic table, it's that there wasn't a periodic table at all. Back then, chemists had to work out: was that a new element that they were looking at, or just a combination of known ones? So papers were published that turned out later to be completely wrong, and were corrected by others. That's how science works, but it also means that a lot of people and places that might have had elementsnamed after them were disappointed. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.."
85,The World Is Slowly Running Out Of Sand,"US Army Corps of Engineers have just finished rebuilding a beach in New Jersey. Engineers dredge sand from offshore and pump it back onto beaches. Beach erosion is happening faster and faster as sea levels rise. Construction industry uses billions of tons of sand every year. No-one's considering stripmining the Jersey shore any time soon. But in a hundred years, who knows? Maybe New Jersey will get a better offer for this sand. It's not a renewable resource, not on any human timescale. And if it's not there to protect the coast: then the folks who live nearby should start getting worried. It just means that as supply goes down, the price of construction will go up... and there are going to be some rough market forces. It has to be this kind of sand: sand that's been created by moving water and waves over aeons. Hundreds of people have been killed over sand. Now, here, the Corps of engineers are keeping a community safe, some birds safe, and making sure there'll still be a beach here for tourists this summer. It was first completed in 1990, and we've come back numerous times over the years to renourish and pump additional sand onto the beach. If we didn't pump this sand into this area and built an engineered system, the communities would be at higher risk of damages from hurricanes, nor'easters and other storm events."
86,ᚼᛒ: Harald Bluetooth and Your Phone,"A thousand years ago, a Danish king ordered those stones to be carved and raised. And now, his name is on our phones. It's called Denmark's birth certificate, it's part of this World Heritage Site. The inscription honours his parents, and then it says: ""Harald, who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian"" A thousand years later, an engineer at Intel called Jim Kardach was working on short-range radio technology. He heard the story of Harald Bluetooth from a Swedish person that he was working alongside, and he figured, huh, that'd make a good codename for the technology. The official name that was decided later was Personal Area Networking, or PAN, a name that stuck until three weeks before launch when the lawyers said that they couldn't possibly trademark something so generic. And that logo? HaraldBluetooth. HB in the runes of the time, more or less. Combine those two characters into what's called a ""bind rune"", sort of kind of like a signature... and there's the Bluetooth logo. It was used for the first time on the iPhone 5, and later the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 7, and even the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 5."
87,The Little-Known Patterns on British Streets,"All around Britain, you will find this: tactile paving. It’s to help blind and partially sighted people find their way around. There are different patterns for different situations. Dots in a grid, like this, mean a dropped kerb for crossing the road. Stripes along the path mean a safe route to follow. Offset dots mean a train platform ahead, a big chasm you could fall into. Lozenge shapes mean a tram platform, something closer to street level that could run you over. Boroughs in London, councils outside of London, seem to be moving more towards aesthetic considerations, i.e. they’re changing the colour to darker greys so it blends in more. By definition if it blending in more, it’ll be harder for people such as myself to actually see. It helps a lot if clues are consistent, so confusion can certainly occur when that isn’t the case. The design standards for how this is laid down are literally a hundred pages long. But so are the design Standards for everything about public infrastructure. Having reliable rules that everyone understands is important when there are tons of metal speeding past you. You can check out their YouTube channel here, and yes, I have linked the full hundred-page design document in the description!"
88,Fallout Shelters and Zurich's Water: Swiss Resilience,"Switzerland is the only country in the world with enough nuclear fallout shelters for the entire population. There is an entire backup water system, fed by nothing more than gravity from a spring on a nearby mountain. It runs through 150 kilometres of pipes to taps in hospitals and fallout shelters, and special drinking fountains like this. These can all be adapted so they can fill a lot of buckets in a very short amount of time withNothing more than some hoses and scaffolding. This water isn't being wasted, by the way. No-one's drinking it, but if it wasn't going through these pipes it'd just be joining a river and heading straight to the ocean by a different path. But Zurich? They have two systems, constantly tested, always running together. Just in case the world ends. It's not likely, because the electricity supply is just as secure as the water supply. But in the event of an emergency: let's say the lake was contaminated somehow, or there's a days-long power cut that shuts all the pumps down: not that that's likely. But if it happens: Zurich is still prepared. It is, of course, some of the safest drinking water in theworld. Because Switzerland. It has a reputation for being precise and reliable."
89,Why YouTube Streams Don't Count For Christmas № 1,"The UK music industry’s official charts are based purely on music sales, not on airplay. Every pop music radio station in Britain could play a track every hour, on the hour. But it wouldn’t make a bit of difference if no one walked into a music shop, opened their wallets, and actually bought the physical single – or, later, paid to download a digital file. For the last 2½ years, we've been not just counting sales, but also adding streams in there as well. We convert the streams to sales by dividing the streams by 100, and then we put it all together. At 5:40pm on December 23rd, BBC Radio 1 will make the announcement, and – at least for this year – someone will still be entering the history books. The official UK chart doesn't count YouTube views, but it's a big debate within the industry, about whether it should or it shouldn't count. That may change at some point in the future, but not quite for now. I don't know who's going to be Christmas number one this year. And neither do the folks here, at the official UK charts company, at least as I record this, although I suspect probably they’ve got a pretty good idea by now."
90,"In Old Movies, Why The Dial Tone After Someone Hangs Up?","In old Hollywood films, when someone is on a phone call and they got hung up on, why did they hear a dial tone? Back in the days of celluloid film, southern California was one of the few places in America with independent telephone companies. So in Hollywood, where all of the movies were being written and filmed, their experience on the telephone was actually different from most of the rest of America, and the world. As I dial a number, various elements of the step connect me through the system from start to finish. And that's where it got the name step-by-step. And as I finish dialling, the call will connect... [ringing]...and it can be answered. But if the calling party hangs up... [dial tone]...the called party will get hit with dial tone right away because the system doesn't know whether I've been hung up. Or they picked whichever option worked best for the scene. If it's still happening when a character uses a cell phone, though? That's just lazy. Thank you to all the team at Seattle's wonderful Museum of Communications! You can check out their YouTube channel over here or pull down the description for a link to the Museum and to see their opening hours and a list of all the incredible equipment they've got."
91,"Wheels, Bombs, and Perpetual Motion Machines","A true perpetual motion machine doesn't just keep spinning forever. It would give out more energy than is put in. And like a wind turbine, it’d let you take some of that extra energy for your own use. The laws of thermodynamics always hold true. This here is a device made by Thomas Young in 1807. It is the original, two centuries old from the archives of the Royal Institution in London. It’s an unbalanced wheel, and there have been many perpetual motion machines like it. There was a giant one in Los Angeles in the early 20th century, advertising a café: and according to Popular Mechanics, it kept going until there was a city-wide power cut. And there was an inventor in 1829 who was sure that a carriage with conical wheels would roll around the world ‘till time shall be no more’ They all work on the same principle: cheat the centre of gravity so it's always on one side, constantly unbalanced in the same direction. This doesn’t work, obviously. No matter how much you complicate it, this wheel will just rock back and forth and eventually settle where the center of gravity is lowest, or where friction stops it. If you have something that multiplies the energy you put in... then after a few seconds, you’ve got a bomb."
92,"The City of the Dead: Colma, California","In the first decades of the 20th century, all the 150,000 bodies buried in San Francisco were moved to one town. Many of those moved here were placed in mass graves, their tombstones sold to be used for construction material or dumped in the Bay as breakwaters. With no-one to pay for new funeral plots and more than a hundred thousand bodies to move, the folks doing the job took shortcuts. Sometimes, modern construction work will exhume dozens of bodies that the movers missed. So why go to the trouble of moving them at all, then? Well, it was either move the bodies immediately, or deal with them while you're digging foundations for new buildings anyway. What else were they going to do? Almost everyone has a fear and disgust response to death, for good reasons: and religion and tradition in America, then, dictated that the dead must be buried. The Catholic Church wouldn't allow cremation until decades later, and, well, there wasn't another option. Most people figure that cemetery plots are forever. That's not true: already, some areas of Europe are re-using graves, and eventually every headstone's going to be weathered away. So here's my question: when does moving a body stop being disrespect for the dead and start being archaeology?"
93,The World's Most Famous Teapot: The Utah Teapot,"The Utah Teapot was the first realistic, complex object to be widely used in computer graphics. Back in the seventies, computer graphics involved a lot of working by hand. It's said that it was used so much for early graphics experiments that some people could remember all of its data in their head and just type it in when they needed it. And at some point, the teapot got squished a bit: some people claim that it's because of old displays with non-square pixels, and some claim it's just because it looked better that way. This is a artifact of the digital era that's got urban legends around it. But whether they're true or not, there's now a canonical version of the teepot: a digital object that's been copied and copied and copying into all sorts of modern culture. Literally billions of people have seen -well, not this teapOT -but a version of it that can be described in one page of numbers. Thanks very much to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California! Pull down the description for links to them and the amazing exhibits they've got here. Pull down to the description to see the amazing displays they'veGot here. Or at least, a digital version of them."
94,3D Printing Stainless Steel with Giant Robot Arms,"Autodesk's Pier 9 lab in San Francisco is working on a robotic 3D printer. Called 'Ash', it can print a piece of stainless steel on a metal plate. The robot is controlled by a person using a 'teach pendant' system. This allows the robot to know where it is, and how it should point. Autodesk is also developing a vision system to monitor and supervise the status of the prints. This would be great for self-driving cars, for example, where the robot can know when it is close to a person, and then avoid that person and continue doing what it’s doing. It would also be a great way to monitor the quality of a 3D print, so that it can correct itself in real time, in order to avoid an actual failure. If the welder runs out of wire, or if something else happens, the robot would traditionally have no way of knowing. If it goes wrong, a bit different error message pop up. This arm here weighs two tonnes, and when it wants to, it moves fast. The only reason I'm allowed to hold the emergency button is because I'm literally holding the button in my hand, just in case. Our robot has no Way of sensing. What currently happens is that when a person shouldn’t be near the robot, a robot shuts down everything."
95,The Spider Dress That Reacts To Personal Space Invaders,"Anouk Wipprecht has created a robotic spider dress. It is 3D printed in nylon in a technique called ‘selective laser sintering’ The dress is on display at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco until March 2017. Pull down the description for more links about her, the dress and the gallery and the exhibition. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.. The robot spider dress is a robotic dress that has mechanical limbs that are reacting on you coming closer, so you coming near. There are two proximity sensors here. They are in the balls of the design and are sensing when you come too close. They’re deciding between 1 of those 12 states in order to create one of these animations. In his book, Edward T. Hall proposes four distance zones: the public, the social, the personal and the intimate. But in Hall’s own words, the zones were only a first approximation. They were based on a tiny sample of university educated Americans. They weren’t representative of human behaviour in general. And visualising something that isn't just invisible, but is actually an abstract concept? That can be a really powerful way to help understand yourself. But despite what some hyper-rationalist people might think, those have value too."
96,The Grave of the Man Who Never Was: Operation Mincemeat,"In 1943, the body of Major William Martin, of the British Royal Marines, was discovered floating off the coast of Huelva, southern Spain. Chained to him was a briefcase, and in it: a letter with details about the Allied armies' plans to attack Greece across the Mediterranean Sea. British Intelligence raced to recover the briefcase before German spies could look through it, but they were too late. Yes, Britain got its documents back: but not before a copy of them was on its way to Hitler, who then moved huge numbers of troops, tanks and boats to Greece, ready to repel the British attack. Hitler was probably quite surprised, then, when the Allies attacked Sicily, off the southern coast of Italy, and not Greece. And won, with a fraction of the losses that they could have suffered. There never was any Major WilliamMartin. He was fictional. But there was a man called Glyndwr Michael, who was a Welshman in London in World War 2, homeless, penniless, friendless. He died on the streets after eating poison; perhaps deliberately, perhaps by desperately eating food that was left out for rats. The truth was still top secret. It wasn't until decades later that his real identity was revealed: and so the grave was corrected."
97,The Bizarre Plan to Drain the Mediterranean: Atlantropa,"In the 1920s, a German architect named Herman Sörgel came up with a plan to drain the Mediterranean Sea. The project was called Atlantropa, and it is one of the most ambitious plans that has even been announced. It would have needed to be 300 metres high, and the foundations would be two and a half kilometres wide. Some meteorologists now reckon that the project might have diverted the Gulf Stream, sending temperatures plunging in most of Europe and ending local agriculture as we knew it. But those are practicalities, right? Humanity could probably overcome that with enough effort and enough political will. But the people on the Mediterranean coast would be, let's say, rather disappointed that they now lived inland, perhaps hundreds of miles from the sea. The plan was popular in his native Germany but not particularly outside. And as for Africa: well, it was the early 20th century, their opinion apparently didn't matter. It wasn't so much a merging of Europe. and Africa as an attempt at assimilation. But let's assume that, somehow, over decades, the Atlantopa project was built. It'd have taken an effort on the scale of the Apollo moon shot. But it would have been worth it, if it ever happened."
98,The Solar Power Towers of Southern Spain,"Two of the first solar towers were built in southern Spain. Almost 2,000 heliostats, movable mirrors, constantly reflect the sun onto the towers. They heat up water into steam, and powering a turbine to generate electricity. When these were built, Spain was in boom times, and heavily subsidising solar power. But then the financial crash hit. The industry got cold feet: Spain had altered the deal, and all the solar companies could do was pray they didn't alter it any further. Or go bankrupt. This might still have been viable, maybe, with some more research and development, and that's what they were trying to do. But now, the cost of regular, everyday solar panels is tumbling. It's already cheaper than building a giant tower, putting in either high pressure water or molten salt for it to heat, and dealing with thousands of moving parts that all have to line up and track the sun perfectly. But right now, this is expensive. It might not have been, if history had taken a different track, if research had poured into these instead of regular solar panels. But as it is, the future probably isn't quite this bright. And there are other plants like it being built: there's one nearly completed in the Atacama Desert in South America."
99,"Cold Wars, Cruise Ships, and the Northwest Passage","In 1953, the Canadian government forcibly resettled Inuit from Northern Quebec here as part of a power play in the Cold War. Climate change means that the Northwest Passage, the once legendary sea route through the north of Canada, is now theoretically open for shipping a few months a year. The idea of more oil being spilled in the Arctic is worrying a lot of people. In a few decades, as the ice melts, more open channels, and drilling for oil and gas becomes possible.

The next relay station is about 40km south of here, in Qasigiannguit. It's an unbroken link. But, of course, there can be some obstructions. There was a whole day where there was no internet up here due to a relay station that had some bad batteries. They can't pull the sea cable away through here, due to these massive icebergs. They scrape along the bottom of the ocean, so for next year they're going to upgrade all the system. They'll pull thesea cable from Nuuk, all the way to Aasiaat, which is about 120km-ish that way. And they're Going to upgrade these cell towers to carry high-speed connections. During the winter, these domes get covered up fully with ice, so they need to go and, er... John, thank you so much! Jakob, holding my microphone. You're welcome. That was not exactly the usual sort of video... Let me turn this camera right. There we go!

102,No-One Knows Who Got To The North Pole First,"No-one is entirely sure who it was who first made it to the North Pole. Frederick Cook claimed to have reached it in 1908, but his records don’t really add up. Robert Peary was widely considered to have led the first expedition that actually reached the North Geographic Pole in 1909. Roald Amundsen led first expedition to provide convincing evidence they reached the pole, by airship. But they didn't land there, they just flew over it. It was after the Second World War, in 1948, when a Soviet expedition finally set foot at the exact geographic North Pole, after flying there. Nowadays, if you have enough money, you can fly to the Pole, or you can take a nuclear-powered icebreaker, and you can send a selfie back via satellite phone. But if all the fancy technology on this bridge fails, we can still use the same technique as explorers centuries ago: and track our position by the stars. At least, where we can see them. I'm on this trip because of Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and so is this man! My name is Ben Brown, and I am so lucky to be here right now!

103,The Front Falls Off: Glaciers Don't Go Backwards,"The Jakobshavn Glacier is one of the fastest and most productive in the world. At the terminus, where the front falls off, it can move at 20 metres a day. From the 1960s to 2000, the actual front of the glacier here barely moved. In ten years, it retreated about the same amount as it had in the entire 20th century. But climate change is about trends, not events, and if you don’t believe the enormous mountain of evidence by now, then someone with no earth science credentials talking into a camera in the Arctic isn't going to convince you either. I'm here with Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and so's she! Hello! That's Elmo Keep, she's writing wonderful profiles of some of the people we meet out here. Follow her on Twitter to see when they're published. Goodbye! And we're only seeing the 10, 20% of these above water. Some glaciers will produce blocks of ice literally the size of Manhattan. And yes, they’ll break up, but like so many processes on our planet, this is on a scale that is pretty much unimaginable to humans. It’s no wonder that the details of climate change are difficult to understand. I’m standing here, watching the ice slowly flow, and I still can't get my head around this. Even standing here in person, my brain is refusing to accept just how massive everything is."

And it's from Inés at draw Curiosity, who's talking about those weird floaty things that you get in your eyes sometimes. So Tom's taken his eyes off his channel and he's invited me to talk to you about 4Visual phenomena and disturbances. You don't have to go particularly far for any of them. For the first one, all you need to do is to look at a blank wall, or up at the sky, and you'll probably notice some dark grey spots floating around. These are floaters and what you're seeing are the shadows cast by bits of debris which have come loose from the back of the eye. And last, but not least, are phospenes."
105,Why Mountain Dew Rots Your Teeth More Than Coca-Cola,"Mountain Dew has a higher titratable acidity than Coca-Cola. This means that it takes longer for the saliva in your mouth to dilute that acid than it would for most cola drinks. Citric acid is an organic acid, meaning that it will be able to break down the calcium in your teeth faster than inorganic acids like the phosphoric acid found in most colas. This ultimately means that Mountain Dew is worse for your teeth than Coca.Cola is way more acidic and that’s something that you might not have known.

It powers the Oxford Electric Bell, and has been running almost continuously for over 176 years. In this time, the bells have run around 10 billion times, give or take. How long can it keep on running for? Well, no one really knows. The people round here reckon that the bell will break from wear and tear long before the battery runs out of power. Next time we have someone with some teeth in soda dissolving the battery. Thank you to the University of Oxford's physics department for letting us film the bell. It's a great channel, check it out — links are or in the description now. I’m off to the Arctic for three weeks, and while I'm gone, some guest presenters are going to be taking over this channel. We start with Sally le Page who has some great videos on her YouTube channel. She has some video clips on her channel, which you can watch here.

107,The Problem With Renewable Energy (and how we're fixing it),"For a few hours in May 2016, for the first time in more than a century, Britain was burning zero coal to generate electricity. All the coal-fired power plants were turned off. And this here is one of the reasons why. Welcome to the Griffin Wind Farm in Scotland. 68 turbines, more than 150 megawatts of capacity. And the turbines rotate and trim the blades to track the wind in real time. At full output, this can power entire cities just from the wind. But as the world moves to renewable energy, we’ve got a little bit of a problem. Because electricity supply has to always match demand, pretty much exactly. There isn't a battery in the world big enough to store power on a national scale. So if a power station suddenly falls off the grid for some reason, then where’s that supply going to come from? And the answer is the kinetic energy in those turbines, in that spinning thousands of tonnes of steel around the country. If the whole grid were running on just wind and solar, there's no rotational mass. There's no grid stability. The minute that supply and demand mismatch, breakers would trip, and the whole thing would fall apart. Now there are some possible solutions to this. Pumped hydro storage has been around for a while. But they’re all experimental at the minute and not particularly efficient."
108,The Mushroom Cloud Over Britain: RAF Fauld and the Hanbury Crater,"RAF Fauld was an old mining operation converted to an underground bomb storage depot for the Royal Air Force. The depot was built in the 1930s for small bombs, the sort that you can move on a conveyor belt. By the end of 1944, the men here at RAF Fauld were storing stacks of high incendiary bombs outside the mine until they could find space inside. The commanding officer was on leave. The officer responsible for the underground stores was also on leave -and it was his deputy's day off too. According to the official inquiry, someone tried to remove a detonator from a live bomb with a brass chisel. And brass chisels cause sparks. 4,000 tonnes of bombs had gone up in one terrible chain reaction, the largest explosion ever in the British Isles. About half the bomb store actually managed to survive the explosion; and while the bombs were removed, there are still tunnels and storage rooms hidden under the crater. But after careless explorers started damaging the site, all the known entrances were filled in. And given the warnings about unexploded bombs still in the crater, I'm not about to climb this fence and go any further. Now slowly, over years, the crater was cleared and reclaimed; decades later, what remains is an odd scar on the landscape."
109,The Fake Vinegar In British Fish and Chip Shops,"This is non-brewed condiment. It's water, ethanoic acid, plus a few colourings and flavourings. In almost the all the chip shops up and down Britain, this is the ""vinegar"" you'll get on the counter. This stuff has been around for a long time, there's a reference to it in a 100-year-old report from Her Majesty's Inspector of Foods. Now legally, it can't be described as vinegar. Trading Standards, the local government agencies that enforce food laws, are really clear on that. It cannot be put in the traditional little bottles that people associate with vinegar. But most people don't know this isn't vinegar. And those of us who do know... actually don't care. No one minds. Up and down the country, everyone agrees: it's fine. This is vinegar. So here's my question: does it matter? [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] It's not like margarine and butter, where the chemical. make-up and health effects are actually different, it's just a slightly different taste and a. slightly different make up. But no one cares. It doesn't matter. And Trading Standards... they could go into every chip shop in the country and get an easy prosecution -but they don't. They've got better things to do, like tracking down food that will actually injure or harm you."
110,"The Man Who Invented, Then Hated, Shopping Malls","Victor Gruen was an architect who came up with the idea for the shopping mall. He wanted it to be a city centre for the suburban sprawl. But money and politics got in the way of his utopian visions. Brent Cross Shopping Centre is described as 'Hell on Earth on a Saturday' But things have changed. Economic downturns and the rise of the internet mean that now a lot of those old malls are closing down. And the new spaces that are popping up in their path? They're a lot more like his original designs. They're pedestrianised high streets, and they're big, open spaces with actual space to sit down that isn't just convincing you to buy. From beyond the grave, Victor Gruen might have the last laugh. Not that that helps me, when that guy just took the last parking space. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

It's just because I'm in a hurry' 'It's probably not, the evidence is shaky, but what matters: it was named after him. And at that point, he was railing against what he called these ""bastard"" offspring of his original idea. Well, this is what we've ended up with'"
111,Nobody's Exactly Sure How Much A Kilogram Is Right Now,"Mass measurement around the world needs to be equivalent. In the next few years, scientists round the world are deciding what the 21st century standard should be. The formal definition will be based on physics, likely Planck's Constant, but how do you make that into a physical thing? There are two options: first, a fixed number of atoms. But there is an alternative which could be cheaper and easier, although it isn't quite as obvious. The watt balance is an electrical way of measuring mass. This is a way of demonstrating simply how a watt balance works. We have a loudspeaker here and if I pass a current through the coil of the loudspeaker, you can see that the cone will move up and move down. If I was to put a mass on here, if I restore the position of the mass, the current I need to do that is a measure of the weight of that mass. The problem I've got is that I don't know the strength of the field of the magnet, or the number of turns on the coil. And I can do a second experiment by moving the cone of the speaker, like that. That would tell me that quantity and allow me to eliminate it from the two experiments. Which, if done accurately, is enough to work out the weight."
112,The Flower That Smells Like Death,"Titan arums bloom for just 48 hours every few years. They use flies and beetles the way many plants use bees: for pollination. These bloom only after it's managed to store enough energy, and that can take anywhere between 7 and 10 years. It's able to send its scent way up above the canopy layer of the rainforest, where it can catch a breeze. And then insects can smell one of these in bloom over 3,000 metres away. It is the same temperature as a dying animal, and the smell is of rotting flesh. And -if you come in here -this colour, we normally see in the butchers' This is the colour of flesh. So by many ways, it's trying to lure in those flies and beetle, thinking that they've found a corpse. Which does just leave us with the question of the smell....yeah. Yeah, okay. That's bad! That's... Thank you very much to the Eden Project for inviting me here! They’ve got a YouTube channel you can check out, and they are open year round in Cornwall, in the south west of England.

113,Why You Can't Advertise Cancer Cures In Britain,"Noel Edmonds endorsed the EMP Pad, a yoga mat that uses electromagnetic fields to help cells in the body function. The company disavowed Noel Edmonds entirely. The reason was: he’d claimed they could help cure cancer. In Britain, there are even stricter laws about cancer treatments. You can’t get away with saying, ""oh, it’s not really a medical device"", or, ""Oh, it's just some herbs"". If you sell something to the public, saying it can help or cure cancer, you can be prosecuted. Even if it does cure cancer,. The idea, back in 1939 when the law was passed, still holds true today. Sell your cure to doctors. If you give them an alternative medicine that works, with evidence to convince them, they’ll start prescribing it, and you, the person who discovered it, you’re probably in line for a Nobel Prize. And if they don't start prescribing. it: well, it probably doesn’n't cure. cancer, does it? And it's almost certainly not a cure. And it”s probably going to hurt people that would otherwise go to the doctor. But the folks who do sell them: they needed to shut down that claim right away, or risk an investigation."
114,"Help, My Fusion Reactor's Making A Weird Noise","JET is a nuclear fusion experiment, a scientific research facility that's hopefully one step on the journey to plentiful, clean fusion power. When it's running, the reactor vessel is literally the hottest place in the solar system, ten times hotter than the core of the sun. If anything goes wrong, power gets cut and the whole system just stops. But if something's more subtly wrong, there's one safety feature you might not expect. Up in the ceiling are surround-sound speakers, hooked up to microphones in the reactor hall, where no human is allowed. Those speakers relay the sound from the experiment to the crew here in the control room in real time, as if they were standing -as if this point where I'm standing right here -was in the middle of the torus. All right. Here goes the pulse. [Five, four, three, two, one, zero...] [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

115,"In Norway, Everyone Can Know How Much You Earn","Tax returns in Norway, Sweden and Finland have been public for years. Knowing for certain you're being paid more than your neighbours makes you more likely to be satisfied with your life. There's also evidence that, although politicians might not like it, public disclosure of tax returns does reduce tax evasion. But there's no strong data on that yet, not that I can find, and it'd be extremely difficult to measure. And because I'm British, because we don't talk about money, you might find out something you don't want to know... or you might hurt someone else. So my reaction to wage transparency is the same as a lot of people's: you first. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

116,Why You Should Write Down Your Goals,"ITV held a telethon in 2000 to get people to promise something. The promises would be held forever, they said, in registers held up and down the country. A few years later, and there's almost no sign that this ever happened. But I'd like to think that all the promises, all the commitments, really did do some good in the world. Even if no-one actually remembers them now. But just the act of committing to something in writing, even if you're the only one to see it, means that your human desire to stay consistent, to stay true to what you think your beliefs are, makes you more likely to achieve it. So I don't know if Kay O'Grady really did overcome OCD, or Susan Moussa really did learn first aid. And perhaps the money that ITV spent on their ill-fated Year of Promise could have been better put to other things. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

117,Unexploded Bombs off the British Coast: the SS Richard Montgomery,"1,400 tonnes of unexploded bombs lie in the Thames Estuary, two miles offshore. If the worst happens, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. No-one knows what the conditions inside the ship are, and there's no research on what seawater does to bombs over more than half a century. The consensus view is that it's safe, but steadily degrading as tide and time take their toll. It's probably fine to do nothing. And trying to clear it, moving all that volatile material, well, that could be a much, much greater risk to life, let alone an enormous expense. And if it did go up, perhaps the water would contain most of the explosion. But no-one's certain. There are risky things like this all over the world, but generally we can quantify them, we can say it's a one-in-a-million chance. But this is a risk that is impossible to put a number on, or say anything other than, yeah, it's probably going to be fine. Doing nothing is probably the right thing to do, and that's what the government's going to do. But we don't know it's the right things to do - not for sure. The only way to know is to wait and see."
118,"Power, Politics and Pragmatism: The British National Grid","In the 1920s, electricity was generated by hundreds of small companies in towns and cities across the country. They were all different and mostly incompatible: London alone had 24 voltages and 10 frequencies. The answer might have been to do what other countries in Europe were doing: set up and enforce standards, regulate prices, maybe even nationalise the power companies. Good plan in theory, but the trouble was that the Prime Minister at the time was Stanley Baldwin, and he led the Conservative party. Politically, he couldn't just assume control of private corporations. That was socialist. So the solution was a very clever and very British compromise: the National Gridiron, later just National Grid. The Central Electricity Board, backed up by the government and run privately, would construct and own the central infrastructure. It would build a network of transmission lines sweeping across the nation. The Grid would reduce the risk for the private generating companies and let them reach a much, much, larger market. If they wanted to connect and reach everyone, they had to meet the Grid's standards for frequency, for voltage, and for reliability. So on the night of 29th October, 1937, without any permission, the engineers in the control rooms quietly decided to connect the whole country together for an hour or two and see what would happen. And it worked. And a year later, even their managers agreed: it was the only way to make sure the lights stayed on everywhere."
119,What Counts as the World's Largest Clock?,"If you ask Google, the largest clock in the world is the one atop the Mecca Clock Tower, in Saudi Arabia. If you ask the Guinness Book of Records, the world's largest clock was a temporary structure made with lasers at the 2011 Burning Man festival. Could we, with a fairly small amount of effort, make a clock as big as the earth? And if so, would it count? Or does a clock need to be something that one person can just look at and actually use to tell the time? [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

120,How To Make Snow,"The Youth Winter Olympic Games have brought Tom Scott over to Lillehammer, in Norway. Here in Hafjell we have about 250 snow guns controlled from a big control room. During a normal season, we use about 30,000 litres a minute. The drier the air is, the more water can evaporate into it. At 100% humidity, the temperature has to be -2 or lower to make snow. And if it's not quite working efficiently enough, then you can buy a kind of protein slurry. You add it, very diluted to the water, and suddenly every droplet is a nucleation site and can form its own snowflake. It's what we need to make this mountain work. Without it we'd be nothing. We need snow! TS: There's a load more videos over on the Olympics channel and on my channel, go check 'em out, go subscribe, and thank you to the Youth Winter Olympics for bringing me out here. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] TS: Much as it'd be great to have a snow gun that works in the middle of summer all you're going to end up with then......is a rainmaker. RH: So, snowmaking is really important for big contests, but it's also really important."
121,Calling The Police Doesn't Charge Your Phone Battery,"There's an urban legend that dialling 999 will charge your phone battery. Some police forces in the UK put out press releases saying it’s not true, don’t do it, it ties up an emergency line. But the weird thing is, it's almost true. When certain types of BlackBerries were really low on battery, they’d go into a locked-down “emergency calls only” mode. It'd let you call the emergency services, just in case, but nothing else. That was a fairly sensible idea by the BlackBerry engineers. But they went about it in a really half-assed way. Because there are emergencies that don't involve calling 999. Being lost or alone or desperate, and just needing to reach one person. [sad music] Mum. I'm sorry. I've made a big mistake. It turned out that on a Blackberry, if you made an emergency call and then hung up immediately... the radios in the phone stayed on. The phone stayed unlocked. With all its connections intact. Except if you locked it, or the screen turned off. Then, depending on the model, you might have to dial 999 again to unlock it. You can see where the myth came from. And mobile phone providers in Britain, they get charged somewhere around a pound every time someone calls 999 through them, even for an instant."
122,Crosswalks Don't Always Make You Safer,"Jaywalking -crossing the road where there isn't a marked crossing -isn't illegal in most of Britain. But there's plenty of research to say that, in some situations, marked crosswalks like this one are actually less safe. On bigger, multi-lane roads? A marked crosswalk is more dangerous, probably because if a car stops in the first lane, pedestrians don't always have a sightline to see any cars still speeding past in the second. Does that mean we should remove all the road markings and let everyone fend for themselves? Well, we can work it out. There are ""shared space"" schemes, based on studies from the Netherlands. The theory is because there aren't strict road markings, everyone is more cautious, cars go a bit slower, and people look both ways. Great in theory, maybe not so good if you're blind or partially sighted. The debate about whether this is a good thing is still going on. And ultimately, the only way to be sure, is for pedestrians to look when they're crossing the road -and drivers to assume that people on foot aren't paying attention to you. 'Cos at Abbey Road? They mostly aren't. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here for credit!]"
123,Why Britain Sucks At Product Placement,"British media has some of the strongest product placement laws in the world. Back in the first years of television, all Britain had was the BBC from Alexandra Palace. In the 60s, strict rules were laid down: advertising and content must never collide. Now, the rules have been relaxed recently. Provided it's flagged up with a tiny symbol at the start of the show, some commercial TV can now include product placements. But for advertisers used to the permissiveness of America, modern-day British TV is still a shock. The Advertising Standards Authority lives behind me, and has all sorts of rules for what we're talking about. But there are two very important sections for us to talk about. Number 1: adverts must be clearly identifiable as adverts. And number 2: you might see why the regulators got a bit annoyed at teen vloggers with cookies in the middle of their regular videos without any warning. They hadn't actually produced any advice for the industry back half a year ago, and then a year and a half ago, they got a lot of advice on how to do it better. It's a good thing they're doing it now, because it's going to get a lot worse in the next few years, I'm sure."
124,The Collapsed Dam That Stopped Los Angeles,"St Francis Dam, outside Los Angeles, collapsed in 1928. Chief engineer William Mulholland declared: ""there it is, take it"" He was in charge of projects that diverted a river, and caused what became known as the California Water Wars. Cities that hadn't been eaten up by LA yet decided that Los Angeles couldn't be trusted with its water projects. They all refused to join, and instead they formed what was called a ""Water District"" with LA - they took joint control of any projects like that in future. And that might have continued, perhaps Burbank, Pasadena, Anaheim, other cities that have separate local government today might all be part of one enormous city... if it wasn't for the St Francis Dam. The leading theory for the collapse is that the foundations were unsound: on solid bedrock, the dam would have been perfectly safe. But it was built on permeable ground, so the weight of water held behind the dam started to seep through and soften the ground under it. The incredible drone shots in this video came from these guys: Ed from Media Giraffes and Alex from Drone Gear. You can see all the 4K footage from this shoot and a few others besides on his channel.

And that I wouldn't have to settle out of court or risk the cost of defending a very expensive lawsuit? No. Am I likely to get sued if I actually show you it? Probably not. But am I willing to risk it when there are lawsuits from the trademark owner and out-of-court settlements going back decades? I'm on vacation. That's the reason that there's just a blur of pixels behind him."
126,"Risk, Immortality, and the Terrifying Pulpit Rock","Pulpit Rock, in the south of Norway, has been called one of the world's scariest tourist attractions. Only one person has ever fallen off it in living memory. An average, modern, healthy, western person has about a 1 in 2500 chance of dying from an accident every year. If you really had literal immortality, if you thought you'd survive into eternity, would you live like this, knowing that, at some point, your number will come up? Or do you hide yourself away, never leave a safe bunker, knowing you'll grow old with it, you will find out what the future holds? Ultimately: which is more human: the desire to experience, or the want to survive? I don't know the answer, and I suspect it's somewhere in the middle, because some old part of my brain, with millions of years of evolution guiding it, has already made the decision for me. Because I am sitting on this bit of the rock, and not out there. That is absolutely terrifying. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] OFF SCREEN: Did you enjoy that? Did I enjoy that?!

127,"Ships, Mines and Magnetism","HMS Defender is one of the new generation of Royal Navy ships. But like all big ships, it has a design flaw that you really can't get around - as long as you're building something out of steel. If you take that much metal, and put it through a big magnetic field -like, say, the Earth's, as it sails around -then it's going to start picking up magnetism. So how do you defend against that? Well, nowadays you use very complicated degaussing equipment on board a ship. But in the past, you used to drag a 2,000 amp electrical cable down the side, or set up an enormous deg aussing coil that is bigger than the ship itself. But what if your ship's job is to get rid of mines, and you need to get close enough to spot them without setting them off? Docked just downriver from Tower Bridge is this: HMS Middleton, a Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel. It's a minesweeper, bascially, which means it can tell how many mines are in adjacent grid squares -no, I'm kidding. It seeks out and destroys mines. But it's able to do that without the mines detecting it and detonating it because this is not made of metal. This ship is made of glass-reinforced plastic. It is able to find and destroy mines that are hunting for magnetic things because, well, it's just a plastic boat."
128,7 Illegal Things To Do In A British Election,"Each candidate can spend no more than about £15,000 on all their campaigning. The parties also have a limit on their national campaigning budget, which is about twenty million pounds. The UK has never allowed political adverts on television.

129,How To Make Something One Atom Thick,"Kate Oliver and Andy Collins from the Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. They show Tom how to make a tip that's one atom thick. They use platinum so that it doesn't conduct oxygen, which would make the tip fatter. But they need a flat, high-contrast background to see the atoms and molecules on the surface of the tip. And for that, they use sellotape, which is stuck to just one of these layers of mica, or maybe a couple. And then: peel it off, and can you see the faint outline of a square on there? TOM: There is. There is -is that just a one-atom thick layer ofmica? KATE: Yep. And that implies that what's left is also entirely flat. Giving us a really good contrast for any atoms, molecules, species -these are some fibres we've got on top of this surface -that we want to have a look at and see what they can do for us that's really useful.

130,Turnpikes and Tolls: What if all major roads were private?,"Almost all the roads out of London at the start of the 19th century were turnpikes, toll roads. Turnpike Trusts did some good: the money paid for a decent road network. But then along came the railways. Suddenly anyone who could afford to pay road tolls could also afford a faster and more comfortable option. The turnpike trusts started to collapse and local government took over. By the time motorways came along, it was accepted that government collected tax, and then used that tax to build new roads. But what if history had turned out slightly differently? If every major route had a toll that went not to government, but to a private company running it? Well, actually, er, we would be in France. Most of the French autoroutes, the motorways there, are run by private companies, collecting tolls, just like the old days. You don't need to visit some bizarre zeppelin-filled alternate reality to find turnpiked -there are always zeppelins in alternate realities -all you need to do is cross the Channel. If every time you drove onto London's Westway, you paid £5 to the Westway Corporation sponsored by McDonalds? well, actually we would have to go to France."

Centre for Quantum Photonics is trying to store that information on single particles. By changing how the waveguides act, you can change the photons -the way the photons pass through the system. It's called Quantum in the Cloud, and it's online now. Jacques Carolan is from the University of Bristol. He joins Tom for a look at the quantum computer in its current form, in a cupboard in the basement of the university. He says: ""It really is just this -you see the very thin black strip in the middle. That's actually the chip. And so it's there, for people to use, it's what we're getting excited about"" He adds: ""We're going to do it with photons, particles of light. And then you start inheriting the beautiful rules of quantum physics. And that's your programming"" The full interview is on BBC Radio 4 at 10.30am on Monday, November 14.

132,Can It Be Too Cold To Snow?,"As air gets colder, it has much less capacity to hold water vapor. The temperature down here while it's quite cold at the minute is not the same as up there. Just because it's cold and dry down here doesn't mean the ice crystals aren't forming up there in the clouds. Clouds are also really good at reflecting the heat from the earth back at the surface. If there's no cloud, sure, there definitely won't be snow, but it's also going to be much colder because the heat isn't trapped below that cloud layer. So the cause and effect is sort of the wrong way round there, but you can see where the old wives' tale comes from. There is some truth to the old saying. It can be too cold to snow. It is very cold here right now, though, and I am going back inside. Aagh! It's down the back of my neck! [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

133,"Ley Lines and Avebury Henge, the Better Version of Stonehenge","Avebury henge, in Wiltshire, is the center of a swirl of energy highways, Ley Lines as they're known. In the 1920's a man called Alfred Watkins brought out a book called ""The Old Straight Track"" The idea that there were dead straight tracks running across Britain that ancient peoples would follow. This is a very real way of having some kind of connection to the ancient humans who were here four and a half, maybe five thousand years ago, and who put these stones up for... Well. We'll never know what reason and if that means we get a little bit of new age beliefs... Well, I can't really begrudge that. Happy winter solstice. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

134,"The Hottest Place in Britain, and the BBC Theme Park","Official Met Office weather station in Swanscombe, east of London, is the warmest point in the UK. It's surrounded by earth on three sides, there's industrial activity, docks, and a sewage plant, all of which could raise the temperature. But there's something more important about this site, this whole peninsula, it doesn't look big on a map but it's big. This will be the site, if all goes well, of the coming Paramount London theme park, the one that, this week, announced it's signed a deal with the BBC in order to license Top Gear, Doctor Who and a load of other TV shows. So, if the temperature in London seems to drop officially in a few years' time, perhaps it has, or, more likely, perhaps they've moved this weather station to make way for The Doctor. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!] It's going to be quite different in 5 or 6 years'Time if it all goesWell, and this weather stations will probably have to be moved. But, nevertheless, nevertheless there's some question as to whether this is actually thewarmest site in Gravesend, as it's known. Or, whether they've just put the weather stations in a slightly wrong place."
135,The Concrete Pillars On Top Of British Hills: Trig Points,"In 1936, Brigadier Martin Hotine, and thousands of people, who worked for the Ordnance Survey, built these pillars, in an attempt to retriangulate Great Britain. Nowadays, GPS has taken over of course, they're little more than a landmark for hill-walkers, but nevertheless, these trig points meant that we had a precise map of the United Kingdom, with nothing more than angles, and a lot of maths. And if you can do that, and you know High School trigonometry, Then you can take one precise baseline measurement across a heath somewhere, the angles you've measured, and work out the distance across the entire United Kingdom. And then, you build these on hills, so that no matter where you are, if you're at a trig point, you can see at least two other trig points. [Translating these videos? Add your name here!

136,Why Four Score and Seven Years Ago?,"""Four score and seven years ago, ""our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation."" Lincoln's Gettysburg Address doesn't sound quite right in a British accent. Why would a great orator choose that, and why does it sound so resonant? Well, the answer goes back to base 20 counting. It's resonant because it's a holdover from much older language. It was used in the Bible, not because of translations from older languages, but because it sounds authoritative. It sounds like the word of God. Something, from Washington DC, that you might not have known. If I say I'm an old mate of Bazza's, do you think they'll let me in? No. No, they... No. If you ever learn French you will know that 87, the number that Lincoln is talking about, is ""quatre-vingt-sept"". Four twenties, and seven. Four score, andSeven. That's a weird way of putting ""87"" isn't it? 'Score' is an archaic term for twenty. There's some European languages who use it, Welsh, traditionally used it. Although decimals have been slipping in lately. There are African languages, American languages that use it all over. And French used it as well."
137,The Floating Lighthouse in New York: The Lightship Ambrose,"The Ambrose is one of very few lightships remaining in the United States, and in the world. It was built in 1908 when there were no rocks to anchor a lighthouse to the sea bed. The Ambrose would sit in the channel, 12 crew at a time, in all weathers. It saved lives as ships would aim for it, which isn't always a good thing. Thank you very much to the  South Street Seaport Museum. Their staff and volunteers are preserving a load of historic ships.

138,The Liquid Nitrogen Tanks of New York,"Two canisters of liquid nitrogen sit undefended on the street. They belong to one of the phone companies. Nitrogen is constantly vented through the tunnels that contain the phone wires in order to keep them dry, and away from oxygen and moistness. The coldness is just a side-effect of how you need to store that much nitrogen. There have apparently never been any incidents with it, and in the event that one. of the many, many vehicles on this busy, busy road crashes into them, apparently it'd just cause a little bit of venting. and outgassing. It seems strange, but there are many things in every city that seem strange, and liquid nitrogen on the streets is one of those minor ones. Welcome to New York. [Translating these subtitles?

139,The Diner Where You Microwaved Your Own Food,"In the 1960s, Tad's Broiled Steaks was one of the first fast food restaurants. You would go in, pick a frozen meal that's been made earlier that day or earlier that week, take it to a microwave oven on your own table and heat it yourself. The guy who opened the restaurant said that in the future, there would be only two types of restaurants: Fancy, upscale ones where someone else did the cooking, and cafeterias like that one, where you went in, picked your frozen meal and set it up in your own microwave oven. And he was nearly right. He failed to predict home microwaves and the ready-meals, and the TV dinners that actually went on to change the world. And the restaurant closed down soon after, but Ray Kroc, the guy who started McDonald's, he took advice from the Townsend family. That McDonald's over there is, in some ways, a descendant of a restaurant that might not have worked out itself, but still left a bit of a mark on history. Who knows, if history had turned out slightly differently, perhaps there'd be microwave Cafeterias all over the world, perhaps. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!]"
140,"There's a Bit of England in New York, Literally","In World War II, American supply ships went to Bristol, found that it was almost completely bombed out and, well, they needed something to help weigh them down on the way back across the Atlantic. They literately took the rubble -the stone, the brick of bombed out Bristol – loaded it onto their ships, took it back here, and then just dumped it in the East River. This entire housing development which has the same 60's and 70's square brick architecture as Bristol because they were built at the same time – is literally built on the rubble of Bristol.

141,What Did Witches Actually Use?,"""Eye of newt"" was actually just mustard seed, something warm and calming to add to a healing broth, something you might not have known. Shakespeare used an actual witches brew and witches suitably angered by that placed a curse on the play, or on him or, if you believe it, on anyone who said that word. It is considered extremely bad luck to use 'that word', 'that name', on an actual set. It could have been a code word, designed to keep magic within the... well, the ""magic circle"". Or it might just have beena dialectal thing, we don't know but what we do know is that it's a bad idea to say 'M...th' on a sound stage. STUPIFY! EXPELLIARMUS!...amateurs. I'm currently at the Harry Potter Studios tour and this is most definitely a soundstage, which means it would be very bad luck... for me to say... the...hi. I am currently very much on the stage, on a set, here at the Warner Brothers Studio tour. This is the potions classroom from Harry Potter. and well, it's considered extremelybad luck to using 'thatword','that name' on anactual set. That doesn't really make sense, not the curse part."

The road is 14 miles long and connects the villages of Kelston and a dozen others besides to the picturesque city of Bath. In the U.K., not getting planning permission is not a crime in itself. You're only breaking the law when the council notices, files an enforcement order against you, and then you refuse to undo what you've done. The public's reaction has been [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] it has been astonishing. So there you go. The Kelston toll Road.

143,Why Britain Uses Separate Hot and Cold Taps,"The mixer tap, brilliant invention, and yet something that seems to have passed Britain by. In most old British houses there's a cold water storage tank up in the attic. But the trouble is that might not be entirely safe drinking water. In the worst case scenario, when there is a backwash valve failure and the mains turns off, that unsafe water could go back, backwash through all the systems, and go out to contaminate the rest of the street. That's not legal, therefor no mixer tap. You don't cross the streams. Even now old habits die hard. And sometimes these things just feel a bit safer. [Translating this video?

144,How To (Appear To) Snap Someone's Neck (On Stage),"The key to doing a stage fighting'snapping of the neck' is -much like the previous type -is the person who's doing the snapping doesn't do anything. If you do this with someone you don't trust implicitly to do stage fighting... It's dangerous. And that is how you break someone's neck on stage. This is Norm, and that -I haven't said this in ages! -is something you might not have known. And obviously, try and sell the ""huaaah!"" And kind of a [choking] noise? -Yeah.......... I'm over there... I hope that looked good! I don't know why I'm doing this. It doesn't hurt! I'm instinctively going like this! If it does hurt, I'm really sorry. It's not supposed to!

145,Ultrasonically Vaporized Vodka!,"The BarBot is a device for turning alcohol and spirits into a nice inhalable mist. In a column  of this, you get about two or three teaspoonfuls of booze. Take the lid off and you can inhale it in, as I just did, and you get a bit of a head rush. Once you've got a few drinks in you, it'll make you go, ""Ooh, hello,"" and be a little bit drunker than you were beforehand. It's not a very good idea in the first place, but if you're under 18, it's illegal. If you inhale too much, you can't breathe it back out. You can't throw it up. There's no body safety mechanism. Your body's not designed to go ""Oh yeah, I can throw this stuff up."" It just goes, ""Oh god, I've-.."" and then, you know, liver poisoning. It just feels like it's a lot more of aYou said ""relatively safe""? Yeah, you are inhaling alcohol -you're inhaling droplets of vodka into your lungs. That's kind of a bad idea.

146,YouTube Doesn't Know Your Password,"Youtube doesn't know your password. Neither does Facebook, or Twitter, or any decent web service, literally. Your password is not stored in their database. It's safer that way. A hacker or a rogue employee can't find out what your password is. So, how do they know that you've typed the right password in when you go back to log in? Well, there are certain types of maths operations that are really easy to do one way, but really difficult to reverse. Multiplying two prime numbers together is relatively easy: 17×11 is 187. There are a few shortcuts that computers and good mathematicians can use to make the operation a bit faster. But, in summary, particularity for huge numbers, there is no efficient way to reverse that operation. It is maths that is easy todo one way and difficult toreverse. If that was interesting, I've done a couple of longer videos over at Computerphile about hashing and password security. If it wasn't, well, well – The stunts you are about to see were performed by trained drivers on a closed course. Do not try this at home. [Translating these subtitles?

147,Gravity Doesn't Always Point Straight To The Earth's Core,"Gravity doesn't always point straight down towards Earth. If you're next to a massive mountain, then the mountain will exert its own gravitational pull. This means that gravity sometimes doesn't point down. Today's lesson is that when it says ""slow down"", it really does mean ""slowdown"". You can come off on an alpine slide! Don't believe the people who say, that you can go down without brakes. You do! And if you don't it hurts! Never mind gravity. THAT is something you might not have known. Road rash in four places, hands stung with nettles, and significant damage to my pride. Chris and Matt, they got down just fine. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]... Wicked!...""Wicked! Wicked! ""Wicked"" is a term used to refer to a film or TV series that has been released in the UK and the U.S. in the last few years.

148,What's The Longest Word In The English Language?,"Longest word in any major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. But that doesn't really count because it's technical. Longest non-technical non-coined word in the English language is antidisestablishmentarianism. Longer word I use: internationalisation, which is a term in technology. That is an unhelpful 20 characters long. That's long enough that it gets abbreviated to i18n when it gets written down. If it's inconvenient, we shorten it. This isn't a real place name this isn't what anyone calls this place. It was a publicity stunt from Victorian times. Even years later, here I am reciting that name to you because it is now a tourist destination. This could never have arisen by anything other than a publicity stunts. Something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] Longest place name in the UK is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. And it took me two weeks to learn that. Long words are there because they're interesting, not because anyone actually uses them in speech. Because they're inconvenient, they're unwieldy, because they slow everyone down."

150,Why Do Flag Emoji Count As Two Characters?,"Unicode Consortium decide what goes into Unicode, they're the reason you have 250 new emojis just gone in. They didn't want to put flags in Unicode, because flags change really often. So instead, they created something called regional indicator symbols. They are characters that are simply A through Z with dots around. That's the official representation. And what that button is doing is it is not typing in a French flag. It's typing in, in reality, behind the scenes, anything that doesn't have a Frenchflag will see... an F and an R FR It's the code for France. You get.fr domain names. That is why it takes two characters to do an emoji flag and not one. And if that was vaguely interesting then I've got a much longer video about what counts a character in my Language Files series. And soon there'll be an upload from Computerphile about emojiis and their history just here. In the mean time, that's why it's two characters for a flag and that is something you might not have known. This really isn't coming off. Is this not whiteboard paint? This is just a wall. I have just drawn on the wall. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
151,The Equation of Time: Clocks Vs Sundials,"There are two different types of time, if you like. There is solar time, that is, the time that means that noon is when the sun is highest in the sky. And then, there is mean time, a kind of averaged, ideal time where noon falls reliably every twenty-four hours. It's a thing that means sundials aren't accurate anymore, even though once upon a time they always were. And you can find from a few centuries ago, things called equation clocks. Perfectly accurate clocks, reliable 24 hours in a day clocks. That would deliberately change their time either by a complicated clockwork mechanism or by the user changing something. So that they were acurate to the sundials and not the other way round. Because sunrise in the east could be 20 minutes, 25 minutes ahead of Sunrise in the west of Britain. So there you go: the equation of time. And the interesting thing about that is that sundials have only been fitted with this in the last couple of centuries. So it went from sundials being accurate and mechanical clocks always being a little bit out. No matter the time of year, and it was noon no matter the country. It went from mechanical clocks being accurate, and sundials always being out, to mechanical clocks not being accurate."
152,"How Do You Make Something Last 1,000 Years?","Longplayer is a music composition for singing bowls, designed to last one thousand years from the start of 2000 to the end of 2999. In order for that to work, it doesn't have to be a person that sees it through, it must be a corporation. In this case a non-profit, a charity something called the Longplayer Trust, whose job it is to keep the composition going. Right now it's being synthesized by a computer. There's a large instrument in there that is in the process of being completed. And the trust's job is this: • Update the computer when it needs updating, • Port the software to another language when it need porting, • Find replacements for the people on the LongPlayer Trust board when they need replacing. That is how you make something last a thousand years. Which is something, you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!] Back to Mail Online home.

153,Fail-Safe vs. Fail-Deadly (with Colin Furze),"I'm with Colin Furze. Dangling upside down with magnetic shoes that he's made. Colin, do you want to explain how these work? Basically, we've got a microwave transformer, you cut it in half, take one of the coils out, and you end up with a super strong electromagnet. If you then put in some shoes, you can make magnet shoes! Which are great aren't they Tom! They are! Surprisingly physically demanding, this. Um, but let's talk about fail-safes. These shoes? Well they may not be fail-deadly, but they're certainly fail-unsafe, because if the electromagnets fail, or if the battery fails or if I, accidentally, push one of these shiny red buttons here, well, then I fall to the ground, neck first, swiftly followed by the incredibly heavy magnetic shoes which, will probably kick me in the face. So with all due respect to your invention Colin, which is marvelous, can I come down now? Yep. That, was take 4, and I am not doing that again. You really appreciate gravity now don't you?

Well, you build a nuclear reactor in the basement of a 17th century building just miles from the centre of London. Despite the words ""nuclear reactor"" being quite scary it was only a tiny reactor. It produced 10 kilowatts that's enough to power about five electric kettles. There would never have been a Chernobyl here. But, well if Thor  had invaded a couple of...

156,Angels Are Actually Pretty Terrifying,"Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite was a Christian writer in the fifth and sixth centuries. Along with Thomas Aquinas, he settled on the modern Christian hierarchy of angels. The ones in the lower orders, they look vaguely humanoid, as the term would be now. But up at the top you have the cherubim. And they're not cherubs in the sense of angelic little children with serene expressions. They have four heads a man, a lion, an eagle and an ox. They look like a wheel within a wheel, covered in eyes. This angel on the other hand is a lot prettier, a lot nicer, and frankly, even though I'm not religious, this is a greater testament to God's work than any wheel. There's as much of that angel below the ground as there is above. 20 meters or so down to the bedrock. Otherwise? Well, the wind might just make it fly away. [Subtitles by Paul Pollard.

When this was built, proper brakes really hadn't been invented. So, the way we'll brake is literally-well we're going backwards at the moment-so we'll stick it in forwards gear. That will put steam into the cylinders on the opposite side and bring us gradually to a nice slow halt, then we'll just saunter off in the opposite direction. And so we comes steadily to a stop, like here, and then once we hit that, it just starts going the other way. That is how you stop Stephenson’s Rocket, that is a train withno brakes.

158,"The Three Types of Twilight, and The Days Without Night","Night doesn't technically start until the sun is 18° below the horizon. Until then, there are three types of twilight: civil twilight, nautical twilight and astronomical twilight. In midsummer, when it's the sun, high in the sky the United Kingdom is north enough, that it never becomes night. From evening to morning we are perpetually in twilight, until finally Autumn rolls around and we dip into night once again. The whole of the UK, and of course a lot of northern Europe, well, we have entire seasons when we never ever technically have night.

They would rise and fall throughout the day, the gas works would spend day and night generating gas steadily the gasometer would rise. In the evening as people turned on most of their cookers, but perhaps their heating as well that gas would be pushed out of it, and it would steadily fall down to the ground. But now, well, they're not needed any more because that's a really inefficient way to store gas with modern technology, all the gas that would be in there can be stored in a 50 meter stretch of high pressure pipeline underground. So, there aren't that many left, they've been steadily demolished ever since the turn of the 20th century, perhaps a little earlier. And now there are very few left. What aren't up for demolition are either listed or protected buildings or aren't long for this world. So they are a bit of Britain's industrial heritage that we will soon be saying goodbye to forever. But in the meantime, if there's still one near you, well,. that's what it used tobe used for."
160,The Level Crossing You Have To Power Yourself,"This is a user operated level crossing in the English countryside near Canterbury. You have to physically pump the barriers to get them to rise. This is a high speed rail line that has Javelin trains on the London to Ramsgate run. The ones that do 140mph are doing about 40, maybe 50mph at most, but all that's stopping me from blocking this line, or worse, being hit by something on this line is -well -this crossing and this little lever down here, that drops the barriers and makes it safe for the trains to cross again. That is something you might not have known. [Subtitles: GC Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!""]""""I'm aware quite how dodgy this movement looks.

161,Is Paris Syndrome A Real Thing?,"The difference between fantasy and reality is the basis of something called Paris syndrome. It is a syndrome that affected mainly Japanese tourists, to the tune of about 20 a year. The symptoms, well, they could be anything from delusions or hallucinations, all the way to tachycardia, which is irregular heartbeat, and other psychosomatic symptoms. Is it a real thing? Well, it's difficult to tell, because it does have journal articles about it, and it does has scholarly references and news articles. Either way, It's Paris syndrome and it's something you might now have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles?

162,Privacy In France: A Lot Of French People Might Be About To Sue Me,"French privacy law is some of the strictest and worst-defined in the world. Just having someone identifiable in the back of my shot might be grounds for someone to sue me. I can take a photo of the Eiffel Tower in daytime, and it's fine, it's not under copyright any more. But, if I take a photos at night, the lighting design on it that is copyrighted. And so, I'd need a license before I were to publish that online. To make matters even more complicated, I am British, and I'll be publishing this when I'm in Britain, to YouTube which is an American company, which has an office in France. It would be a complete mess. Maybe I'd win if someone brought a case against me, maybe I wouldn't. But either way, there'd be a long and costly legal battle.

It is a relic of a past time, a marker that simply says ""this is where we started from"" This is back when we had all the triangulation and manual calculations needed to actually map something, back when it was longhand.

But what you have is a relics of a Past Time, a markers that simply say ""This is where they started from"". This is what Point Zero looks like, and it's a relic from a time when people used to do it in the oldfashioned way, using longhands. It's a marker of the past, but it's no longer used."
164,The 19th Century Channel Tunnel Wasn't Just A Dream,"In 1881 exploratory tunnels were made about a mile out from the UK, and out from France. There was a tunnel started, but then the British press and politicians got cold feet, and thought it might compromise our national security. In the 1970s the British government at the time was all for building a tunnel. But then they gotcold feet when the economy tanked. But just imagine: we might have had a Channel Tunnel a century earlier if it hadn't been for Britain being worried about its sovereignty, although given there was World War II and Hitler really could have invaded through it, perhaps they were onto the right idea. That is something you might not have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!] The Channel Tunnel is one of the wonders of the modern world. It is under the English Channel and runs from France to the UK. The tunnel was built in the 1960s and 1970s by the French government and the French company SNCF. It cost £1.5bn to build. It was completed in the 1990s and is now the world's longest rail tunnel. It runs under the seabed between France and the UK and links the Channel with the French Riviera."

166,The London Railway of the Dead,"The London Necropolis railway was a real thing for nearly a century. The first train ran in 1854, and while the motor car starting to become popular did diminish the service in the 20th century. It ran until World War II. The only thing that stopped it was the bombing out of the railway tracks, and this whole area during the Blitz. If those tracks hadn't been bombed out, theoretically, we could still be seeing 21st century hearse trains going out to Brookwood. And that is something you might not have known.

The World Health Organization has to predict, months in advance, which flu strains will be 'popular' this winter. Because it doesn't generally kill people, just causes some discomfort, there isn't the millions in research funds going towards getting rid of it. So instead we take pain killers, and anti-inflammatories and decongestants, and we accept that we can win this battle on our own. Even though we cannot win the war. Because the enemy will go away, mutate, and just come back a few months later. And that is something you may not have known. And now I am going to stop talking. Closed captions by MM.

There are so few last names in total that you have to index by first name and by occupation. All of those are that Icelandic system, which used to be the English system, it's just changed now. If you're asking for people's names, either on a paper form or online, don't put first and last name. Don't put—the worst-case— Christian name and surname. Just give someone a box to type into—just ask them what their name is.

It is a battleground between humans trying to keep our world working and nature, which very much wants to go its own way. The Old River Control Structure means that the Atchafalaya River is dammed is stopped and 70% of the flow coming into it still moves down the Mississippi. It would be a multi billion dollar, possibly even a trillion dollar disaster for America if the river were to move any further down the river and into the Gulf of Mexico. It's a big problem because here we have all these factories all these container docks built, and relying on this river is a big mistake for the US. It could be a trillion-dollar disaster for the U.S. and for the world if it moved too far. It will be a battle between humans and nature for a long time to come, but it will be worth it in the long run. The battle for the future of America will be fought on the banks of the Mississippi River, and in the waters that lie between us and the rest of the world. The fight for America's future is going to be a long and bloody one, and it's going to take a lot of work to get it to the right place in the first place."

The reason is a decision by the US postal service when they were setting up ZIP codes. Back in 2000, there was a company called AllAdvantage.com that would put adverts permanently in the bottom of your screen. The company died when the dot-com bubble crashed, but you might not have known about it. It was a dodgy pyramid scheme, where people would try to get as much money as possible by using fake accounts to sign up to the service. And they'd get a cut of what they got, and all the people they referred would send some money to you as well. It's a very silly web service, burning through a lot of money, very quickly, and being scammed for all they could take. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!

They apply for planning permission from themselves, they have the ability to build all sorts of things. They have eminent domain, as well, which means that they can seize small amounts of land from around their borders for their own municipality if they need it for the public good. They also have planning permission to build their own nuclear power station. It's in the legislation from the 1960s still. And, while they've never actually built that nuke plant – they have a small oil-fired plant somewhere on property –  they had their own runway briefly. There was gonna be a massive city here and then Walt Disney died, and what we are left with is the Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow, or EPCOT.

The idea was that if you burned in 10 minutes without sunblock, that would multiply that by 50. But sunblock's a lot more complicated than that, depending on skin tone, on all sorts of things. Unless the sunblock is broad-spectrum, as this is, it doesn't cover against the more harmful effects the long-term effects, not just turning red. In Australia no more than 30 is considered confusing to people who might think they can put sunblock on and stay out all day, every day, with no risk of skin cancer. So, there you go.

179,The Datablast: Experimental Interactive TV From The 1990s,"In the early 90s, before the web came along, a couple of British programs on ITV experimented with something called a datablast. Home video recorders were now a thing. So, right at the end of their shows, they would put information in each frame over the credits. So that home viewers could record the whole thing, and then pause through at their leisure. Which was a good idea in theory, in practice it was a bad idea because the web come along. But who knows?

186,Why Is London's Cable Car So Damn High?,"London's Cable Car is 90 metres tall. The height is a compromise to allow ships to pass underneath. It is a bodge job at best, but then that pretty much sums up the Mayor of London. It has to be high enough to let those vessels pass underneath at low tide. If a tall ship needs to come underneath, they will remove all the gondolas and make sure there's no passengers on board. So that the wire, unladen, raises up enough to allow boats to pass. And that is something you might not know. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] It is also available in English, French, Spanish and German. It costs £60 million to run. It was built to provide a view over the city, but it is a boondoggle at best. If you want a cable car with a view of London, you don't need it to be that high. It's a compromise. Every metre you ratchet up the height, you also ratchet. up the cost. But it's a good idea to have a good view of the city from the top of the cable car. It gives you a good vantage point. It also gives you the chance to see the city in all its glory."
187,British Nuclear War from Beyond the Grave: The Letter of Last Resort,"Inside every British nuclear submarine, inside a safe, inside another safe is one of four letters, all identical and handwritten by the Prime Minister. If the submarine surfaces and finds that Britain is destroyed and one of the tests they use is whether Radio 4 is still broadcasting... allegedly... they look in the safe. They open the envelope, they look at the letter, and that tells them whether they kill uncountable numbers of people as retaliation or whether they go the nearest friendly port and do what they can to rebuild. Once it's started, all bets are off. You may as well just give up because the idea was never to launch......it was always to deter. And that is something you may not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add your own name here!""]""""The thing about nuclear war is, it is monumentally stupid.  It involves the deaths of everyone involved and uncountability numbers of civilian casualties.  So the thing is... if you know that there are missiles launching towards the UK and you have four minutes to respond as was quite possible during the 1980's... What do you do? Do you launch?  Do you send yours off in return, knowing that the only thing it can accomplish is killing more innocent civilians? Or... do you accept that all you can do at this point is kill more people and not launch?"""
188,Why Wind Farms Don't Always Turn When It's Windy,"Wind farms aren't built to take extremely high wind speedsabove 50-55 mph. The national grid can't cope with more than enough power being dumped into it. So, if the demand is low, then they will just turn off the ones, that are easy to turn off, like this. And when demand rises again, they will turn on this and hydroelectric power plants, in order to deal with instant demand. Nuclear, coal, gasall much harder to shut down, all much hard to start up. And so, the national grid keeps us balanced at 50 Hertz-50 cycles a second, 60 in America, 50 in Britain-by monitoring the plants like this and turning them on or off, as needs be. And that is something you might now have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!] And that's why, when it's windy wind farms aren’t always on and rotating. And there are a couple of reasons. One, is that wind farms don't always turn on and rotate. And the other reason is that there are no giant storage batteries, that can hold the entire output of a power station. That’s why they stop them running, because the amount of energy they would lose from doing that is much less."

192,"A Zeppelin, A Cat, and The World's First In-Flight Radio Message","In 1910 the airship America made the first ever attempt at a cross Atlantic crossing. One of the engineers scooped up a stray cat, who'd been living in the hangar. They christened the cat Kiddo and said: ""This will be great, we'll take him along, he can be the ship's mascot"" Kiddo was not keen on this idea at all, kicked up a real stink, and so once they got out of the Atlantic they sent a life boat out to fetch the cat. The cat was put in a bag, lowered down to a boat, the cat was furious, the waves were too choppy, they couldn't rescue him. They ended up having to hoist him back on board. And, you know, it settled into the flight. They quickly discovered that he was the perfect companion, because cats are better than barometers: the cat would get grumpy before they hit bad weather, way before any of their instruments could detect it. They eventually spotted a Royal Mail ship out at sea, managed to signal SOS to them, got rescued by it. And I think they made theFirst ever aerial SOS call as well. And they were rescued, along with the cat, and they were never seen again. The airship floated off and was never seen once again."

The Thames to this day still sometimes has raw sewage pumped into it. And that is something you might not know, that the Thames still has a bit of 19th-century stink in to it now and again.

198,The 134-Hour Television Show from the Arctic Circle,"NRK, the National Broadcaster, the equivalent of the BBC or PBS, excels at slow television. In 2011 they took a load of cameras and just attached them to this boat and broadcast its journey 24 hours a day as it went up. It was beautiful all the way, Norwegan fjords, gorgeous sun, well if you want to see it fortunately they released all the footage through Creative Commons, so there's some interesting mashups here on YouTube if you don't want to wait the full 134 hours. But people did watch this. Maybe just for a few minutes, maybe for a a few hours, maybe they just kept it on the television all the time, in the same way as they kept on the train that stayed for 24 hours thorough Norway or the log fire that simply burned. Slow television is an antidote to the reality TV show and the fast cut editing of today. And is it massively popular? Well, no, of course not, that's why you're watching 2 minute videos on YouTube rather than 134 hours of footage of a boat. But don't rule it out because its surprising how many people will just tune in for a little while, to something calming and pleasant and slow. And that is something you might not have known."

200,How To Make An Orange Peel Flamethrower,"Felix Cohen, who runs the Manhattans Project, shows us how to make a drink that we can actually flame. We'll make a Mandarin Sour with half a lemon, sugar syrup and the white of an egg. And we're going to take an orange. You want to get a nice firm peel on the orange So this is not a particularly big one but it's got a good feel to it. And you'll want to keep it as flat as possible. We've got just a little bit of pith on the back of that. And then grab a lighter. I like to use a Zippo for this, 'cos you get a better flame out of it. But matches are also good or even just a petrol lighter. You'regoing to hold the flame between the orange peel and the glass and you're Going to have the orange Peel between first fingers and your thumb. Making sure not to bend it. and you just want to warm it up gently here. and that is just breaking open a whole bunch of vessels in the skin of the orange that hold the orange oil which is what we are going to set on fire. So once you've warmed it, just hold the Flame between it and gently pinch and you'll get anice flame out. and gives the drink a really delicious smell."

202,There Are Special Crossings For Horses In Britain,"In Britain, there are special crossings for horses. The best part is the name, because in Britain we have Pelican crossings.

Add your name here!] And here we have a special button-there's one up there as well for if you're already mounted on your horse-and a special staging area, that I'm currently standing in, in which horses can wait before the lights change and they are able to cross the road that way. Not kidding. Because what I'm on is technically known as a 'bridleway' It's a footpath that horses and riders can use as well. So here we Have a special Button-there’s one upthere as well if you’re already mounted. And here is the best part: the names are Pelican, Toucan, Puffin, Pegasus, Pegasus and Pegasus. And they're the ones with the special cameras and lights, like those up there-that will track pedestrians as they cross and not stop the traffic any more than they have to."
203,I finally found a useful monorail.,"In 2020, I visited one of the last surviving Roadmachines cargo monorails. They were actually useful and practical, but they were temporary constructions designed for having cargo hauled around work sites. And not only is it still in use, new versions of it are being built. So I reached out to the company that makes them and I asked them, ""Can I have a go on one, please?"" This is the Monorack. We build mainly ropeways. That's our main business. Everything with the rope. Aerial tramways, chair lifts, ski lifts. And Monoracks is a Garaventa product since nearly 45 years. They installed mainly in the Alp area. Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Canada, Sweden, Asia. All over the world we have more or less about 800 Monoracked. The invention that makes this thing so useful is down on the track. This is a rack railway, so the track has grooves and the cogs onboard the train lock into it. That means it can climb very steep hills like this and take tight corners with no risk of slipping. Having just one lightweight rail means it doesn't take up much room. It can go around tight corners and it's easy to install. I genuinely can't think of a better solution for regularly, safely, moving things up and down steep, rough terrain."
204,I thought the treadmill crane was fictional.,"Guédelon Castle is experimental archeology and a tourist attraction. The techniques rediscovered here are now helping with the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral. The castle itself will be finished in about another 10 years. It's taking about 35 years in all to finish the castle which is a really long time compared to the Middle Ages. But in terms of health and safety we're clearly in the 21st century. We have hard hats, steel toe capped shoes, protective eyewear, masks when we're working with the sandstone from the quarry. All the scaffolding is heavily reinforced. So obviously we're not trying to discover how many people were killed or injured in the 13th century. So take care of your back. This isn't a royal castle. This is essentially being built as a private home but there will be defensive elements within the castle. There'll be a portcullis, there'll be murder holes, arrow loops, crenelated walling. And all of this even though there's very little chance that the castle would've been attacked in the middle of the 13rd century these features are still in place. There's not any fancy modern pulleys or anything like that, it's just-Diameter of this versus diameter of this. Yes."
205,This is the most interesting roof in London.,"The Royal Albert Hall is one of the most famous and prestigious concert halls in Britain and the world. It's 150 years old, and basically every world famous musician and band has performed here at some point. In the late 1960s, the now-iconic ""mushrooms"" were added to the hall. They are suspended, convex diffusers, and they help cut down the echo tremendously. In 2019, the sound system was replaced completely within the hall, and the reaction from audiences has been absolutely tremendous. This is right at the top of the glass roof, it is 40 meters down to the floor, and just through there is an air vent called the ""corona"", and running across it is a tension steel mesh to let the technicians access it. The weight of the roof, the dead weight ofThe wrought-iron structure is about 340 tonnes. The roof itself in total can take about a thousand tonnes, inclusive of all permanent and imposed loads, such as wind and snow loading. There is approximately a hundred motorized chain hoists which hang from the original wrought iron structure of the Roof, which vary in their load rating, but some can carry up to 1-2 tonnes of show infrastructure. We have lighting rails, which support lighting, sound speakers, as well as the mushrooms which provide the acoustic dampening of the auditorium."
206,Delivering mail by jumping from a moving boat,"""Mail jumping"" is a summer tradition here at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, USA, and it's also a tourist attraction. In 1916, the predecessor of this company got the mail boat, Walworth, and started that daily, seasonal mail delivery around the lake. The mail boat goes out every day at 10am. Even on Sundays, we do the Sunday papers. There are six mail jumpers that do this job. The safety vests that they wear are self-flating. Most of the time when they miss, they miss coming back onto the boat. Every moment they get wet, they get a blow-in-the-face. Every time that we deliver a letter, we have to scoop it up and put it on it on the pier. And then it's just, so it's jump, run, run,. run, running, run. Thing in the mailbox. It's going to be right there for you. We're not postal employees. We had about 15 kids try out for what ends up being about five or six spots. They're a mail jumper and tour guide. They have to be somebody that's pretty athletic, but we let the tryouts pretty much sort that out. So I actually fell in when I tried out for mail jumping, but they let me do it again and get a second chance."
207,A geyser that shoots sparkling mineral water,"Soda Springs, Idaho, has a geyser that shoots soda water up into the sky. Underneath the town, there's a natural reservoir of carbonated mineral water. In 1937, a group of local businessmen started talking about a pool for Soda Springs. When they stopped drilling, they were in a pocket of CO₂ gas and as they stopped, they combined, and that formed the pressure that released it. It's the only one in America, as far as I can tell, where it's only one on a regular timer, where the public can just turn it up and watch for a few minutes.. The first English-language accounts date from the days of the Oregon Trail, which passed through this area, although the springs were used well before European settlers ever got to the area. The pioneers would pick the warm springs out to do laundry, and they would mix their flour to make their bread with the soda springs. They didn't need yeast and their bread would rise. There are five that I know of left that have soda water. The majority of those springs were covered up in 1923 when they built the Alexander Dam. At one time, they bottled the water. Not from any of the springs the city has, but they bottled it and sold it worldwide. If you did that, you'd have a hard time getting that water off."
208,It's a pile of mining waste. Want to go skiing on it?,"Mining byproducts are usually left behind after extraction and processing. But in Hirschau, in Germany, it's a bit different. There is a big pile of mining byproduct here. But it's just sand. Regular sand. Made of quartz, like what you'd find in the desert. These days the sand that the mines produce here is sold off. But for decades there was too much of it, so as it was pretty harmless, the mining companies just piled it up. What do you do with 35 million tons of sand, in a pile that's dominating the landscape? The answer, of course, is make it a tourist attraction. Tourists have a reason to come here, and spend money. There are more jobs for the locals. And every so often, someone will come along and tell the world that, hey, there's a ski slope made of sand in Germany. No, I can't sandboard, I would die. This is not the hill to learn on! I'm going to take the little cable car down. How do I... I'm genuinely terrified I'mGoing to slip off this! HowDo I get out of this? That tightened it! Oh my god, okay. In German, Mount Kaolino is a ski resort and amusement park."
209,Maybe rich people should build weird fountains again,"The Water Games of Bergpark Wilhelmshöhe in Germany is a World Heritage Site. The fountains and water features here are powered by gravity, and controlled on-demand by hidden mechanisms in underground pipelines. The water goes through a series of stations, each a few minutes' walk apart, and at each station the water is released manually. By the time you see this video, the Wasserspiele will be open to the public for the summer season. But today, they are just testing. A few lucky tourists were in the right place at the right time, but the team here didn’t announce this was happening. Except, they sort of did, because first, there was big release of water at the top and the cascades that go half way down the hill. And I really wasn't expecting the noise. The rushing water brings a lot of air with it, and that’s forced through the trumpets that the Herald statues hold. And it all ends here, at the fifty-metre fountain. And the crowds of people who’ll be coming to watch this summer will follow along, walking the path, waiting for the water to be released and for each show to begin. It might be nice if things like this came back into fashion."
210,I rode a giant mechanical elephant. You can too.,"Les Machines de l'île, the island machines, are best known for their giant mechanical elephant. 12 meters high, weighing 48 tons, it regularly ""goes for a walk"" around the city. A ride on this elephant is less than €10, and there are 50 passengers allowed on board. Inside the gallery, we have a caterpillar, a heron, and a spider, all giant machines. The Sea World is a carousel where you can go inside and take a ride on the carousel. A lot of art projects like this struggle to rent and pay for admission. Charging people for rides and admission is a great way to make this art sustainable and big like a big theme park, says the project's founder, Jean-Claude Lecomte. The machines are inspired by real fish or real sea worlds, he says, and they can turn a great deal of water into gold or oil. The most difficult to move is the spider, because it's about 7.5 meters high and about 3 meters wide. It's the same as you move two very complicated, diggers at the same time, Lecommte says, because ""Little"" is a euphemism for ""little"" The project was started in 2004, from 2004 to 2007, about 30 months of construction."
211,You're not allowed in this cave. But there's a copy.,"The Chauvet cave is the oldest painted cave we know of. The cave has been rediscovered the 19th of December 1994. It has been a tremendous discovery. Roughly 1,000 representations, paintings, drawings, engravings. The engravings are white in color, the paintings are red, and the drawings, which are made with charcoal, are black. This isn't the real cave. It's a replica called Chauvet 2. The shapes of the cave walls that it's painted on were laser scanned and recreated. Cavers and historians would be able to pick up things that give it away, like the suspiciously well-maintained lighting. But to a layperson, this is roughly the experience you'd get standing in the original Chauvet Cave if it had been turned into a tourist attraction, complete with a lot of other exhibits outside. There is something about standing there exactly where an ancestor painted on a wall, and this cave can't provide that. But it's pretty accurate, and just a few kilometers away from the original, except you don't have to climb down a big ladder to get here. If the original cave had been open to tourists, maybe it would have been devastated. Would this replica feel the same if someone built it in London or Paris?"
212,Europe's toughest airport landing used to be a lot harder,"Funchal Airport, on the island of Madeira, is one of the most difficult places in Europe to land a commercial plane. Madeira is basically one huge mountain just sticking out of the Atlantic Ocean. There isn't any part of this island flat enough for long enough that it can support a runway. The runway was extended another 200 meters in the '70s, but it still wasn't enough. The only option was to build a bridge: big enough, wide enough and strong enough, somehow, to handle a fully loaded airliner landing on it. So that's what they did. There hasn't been an incident on this runway in nearly half a century. For most passengers, this is just a normal landing at a normal airport. Or at worst, a bit of a bumpy, turbulent landing. And the approach has a late, low turn that requires special training. And pilots aren't even allowed to start that training until they've had 200 hours flying the type of aircraft they'll be landing here. It's unlike any other space I've ever been in. There's a whole boatyard under here, a go kart track. The noise you can hear is industry. The tallest ones are more than 50 metres high. Just the base of each pillar is taller than I am. The foundations go far down into the ground."
213,"Downhill, on a couch, on public roads.","Funchal, the capital of Madeira, has one of Europe's strangest tourist attractions. Wooden toboggans on smooth runners that are powered by people in straw hats. And, uh, there aren't any seatbelts. From the start, they used the sledges to bring some wood from the mountains to the town by the sea. After that, they adapt for tourists. We have about 60 baskets running most of the day. The toboggan is made of wood, normal wood. And if it sticks to the floor, we put some grease under the basket and it slides much better. And we have a workshop where we fix the baskets, and we build new ones. and we keep rotating the baskets. We are 154 men. (IN PORTUGUESE:)    The basket carts in Funchal are operated by 154 men, who are based in the town's harbour. The baskets are made of normal wood, and if they stick to the ground, they put grease under them to make them slide better. and if it is too slippery, we fix it with grease under it to make it slide more easily. And there is a workshop for fixing the baskets and building new ones, so that we can keep rotating them."
214,The bridge that must legally wobble,"Suspension bridge over the River Lee, in Cork, in the south of Ireland, is called ""Daly's Bridge"", after a businessman who helped fund it back in the 1920s. But unofficially, it has a different name: the Shakey Bridge. Because it shakes. In 2017, an inspection looked at the corrosion and damage that had accumulated over the years on the bridge. The goal here was to repair this bridge so that it can survive, and shake for another century to come. But here's the problem. This bridge is on the local Record of Protected Structures. It must be maintained and repaired, but it also can't be changed. It would have been entirely possible, with modern technology and materials, to build an identical bridge that was much more stable. But in this case, their job was to keep the things the same, and fix the shake. It was less than a century earlier, nearly a century ago, when it was brand new. The bridge now goes up and down at 2.2 cycles a second, and it's bouncy! In the early 1700s, there was a ferry boat that brought people from here across to the other side. But unfortunately between 1906 and 1908, the Dooley family retired, retired themselves from the ferry boat industry. And it was through the philanthropy of a man called James Daly, who gave nearly £700 towards the construction of a bridge project."
215,The giant archive hidden under the British countryside,"DeepStore is an archive hidden in a working salt mine in the north of England. Because there's so much space available, it's also an archive for actual physical objects. DeepStore was set up in the 1990s because we've got the perfect atmosphere down here to store items. Laura Ashley is a UK interiors lifestyle and fashion brand. It's a continually growing archive for Laura Ashley. Original artworks and fabric is never thrown away, so this is what Laura Ashley will always keep. We can't keep everything, but preservation and preservation will take skill, time and money. And the more you preserve, the more upkeep it takes. Perhaps the most important decision any archivist has to make is what to keep and what to throw away. We've got almost a hundred thousand items in this archive, but that is by no means everything that was ever manufactured by Laura Ashley, so that is what this core archive is about. The core of the Laura Ashley archive is what would never be thrown away in the first place: the artworks, the fabric, the wallpaper and the hand drawn artworks that Laura Ashley has created over the years. We are 150 metres underground and about a kilometre into that mine... is DeepStore. The area that the mine occupies is around 3.5km east to west, and about 2.5 km north to south."
216,"After 140 years, this old technology still keeps trains safe","140 years ago, the Callander and Oban railway set up a rockfall detection system along four miles of remote hillside railway track. The system was nicknamed Anderson's Piano after its inventor and after the humming noises that the wires sometimes make in high winds. By modern standards, it's a really basic system. There's no electricity. Just these wires along the track, held under tension, mechanically linked to the signals. If a big boulder falls down, it hits a wire, the wire snaps, the tension's released, and the signal at each end of that bit of wire changes to show danger. Repeat for 17 signals over the 4 miles of railway. Scotland's railway is about 3,500 track-miles. So we can't protect that whole length, so we need to look at other ways of keeping the trains safe, which is where the rockfall Detection comes in. It's not perfect detection in terms of screening out. So vegetation can trip it off, animal movements if they do get inside the boundary. Very manual to reset. We are not able to respond someone to the problem when it occurs. We need to wait until after it's occurred, because the first time we know about it is when a driver tells us. Prevention is better than detection, so stopping the rocks is definitely better than detecting them."
217,"The Elie Chainwalk is safe, as long as you follow the signs","The Elie Chainwalk is 500 metres long and made up of eight chains anchored into the cliff face. It was set up in the 1920s to help local fishermen get down the cliffs to their boats. A century later it's maintained as a local attraction and as optional side trip on the local coast path. It's open to the public, completely open access all year round, but it's not for the faint-hearted. It is dangerous enough that the safety signs are justified, so plan ahead and know the tides, and know what the weather's going to be like so that you don't get surprised as you go along the chains. But what I love most about this is the Chain Walk doesn't really lead anywhere important. You go across some cliffs, down a bit, across, up again, and you get access to a couple of beaches that are pretty much like every other beach around here. People do this, people take a small but significant risk and take the Chainwalk for no other reason than... it's there. It does exist, and no-one wants to get rid of it. The Chain Walk was repaired about ten years ago after someone stole the chains, and every six months engineers come out to check that everything is still anchored in, safe and intact."
218,This town forgot to be a city,"Rochester had been a city since the 13th century, when its cathedral was consecrated. By the 1970s, urban expansion had merged the string of towns along this bit of the Medway river. In 1974, all those local governments were merged too, legally becoming the Borough of Medway. In 2002, Rochester was no longer on the list. It hadn't been for four years. And they were now just living in a regular town, not a city. A local council had to appoint ""Charter Trustees"", a group to represent the original city. The cost was estimated at about £60,000. But a Freedom of Information Request pulled the minutes from the public record just a few weeks ago. And as far as I can tell, they're inconclusive: they might be that the council didn't understand the consequences, or that no-one wanted to pay for it and kept being kept passed. But what can be explained by malice can be attributed to what can never be explained to malice. There's a standard rule of thumb called Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice what can only be explained in the sort-of-ambiguous way I would write if I knew it was risky and I wanted to avoid making a risky decision."
219,The giant chainmail box that stops a house dissolving,"The Hill House in south-west Scotland was built in 1902 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The house exterior just soaks up all the heavy Scottish rains, and lets the water in. 120 years after it was built, this whole building is slowly cracking and crumbling and dissolving. The National Trust for Scotland had to build a very big drying room. The walls in this box are made of chainmail. If you go and order a modern armour costume with a chainmail vest, it will be made of this same stuff. It's more than 30 million rings of stainless steel linked together, weighing eight tonnes. The box is made up of 32.4 million individual chain mail links that surround the house, in the worlds largest sheet of chain mail. In terms of construction, it took nine months. It really is one of a kind. It costs around £4,500,000. The Hill House is so important. It is globally known. We attract visitors from all over the world in a pilgrimage to come and visit the Hill House. They didn't need to add the staircases and gantries and ramps here. But if you block this house from public view for the 15 years it'll take to dry out and repair, then there's a chance the public are going to forget about it. It'll look like a construction site, an eyesore."
220,Literally just three minutes where I talk about some rocks,"In 1788 James Hutton, known as the father of modern geology visited Siccar Point, about an hour east of Edinburgh in Scotland. He was looking for two types of rock right next to each other in a way that could only have been made over what we now call ""geological time"" 435 million years ago, a type of grey sandstone called greywacke was laid down at the bottom of what was then the ocean. Over millions of years it was folded tilted and uplifted, millimeter by millimeter, until the layers became almost vertical. and then 370 million years later, red sandstone was laid on top of it. Now, today, above sea level you have something that should have been impossible according to scholars in the 18th century: two completely different ages, types and directions of rock locked to eachOther, clear for the eye to see It's called an ""unconformity"". Hutton had found other unconformities before, and he'd find more afterwards. They're not too rare if you know what you're looking for. But this was the most obvious, the most dramatic and the most convincing. Not that it did convince everyone. It took more than one person and more than a lifetime for the theory to become properly accepted. But now if you've done basic, high-school earth science: none of this is surprising, right? That's how the whole planet works."
221,How one British laboratory protects the world's chocolate,"About 30 to 40% of the entire world's crop of cocoa is lost to pests and diseases every year. Botanists send plant cuttings around the world, so they can cross breed them and see what the results are. The International Cocoa Quarantine Center in southern England quarantines cocoa plants for two years. When a researcher or grower orders a cutting from here, they know that they won't also get something nasty that could infect their existing cocoa crop or even their entire region's cocoa crop. If there does end up being a worldwide cocoa shortage, it doesn't mean that the grocery store shelves will end up empty. It just means that the price of chocolate will rise and rise as supply falls. And the big manufacturers would very much like to make sure that chocolate does not go back to being a luxury, and the folks here at the quarantine center  are doing their bit to makesure that doesn't happen. The reason why it is so long is because viruses can potentially stay latent in the plant for a long period of time. In the UK, we don't grow cocoa. The fact that we're located in a country that does not grow cocoa means there's no risk of pests and disease which are endemic to cocoa entering the facility. So if we were to receive any material which had a nasty disease, that material would be discarded."
222,The meters-high mountain of mannequins in the Midlands,"""Mannequin mountain"" is a mountain of mannequins in the Midlands. 25,000 of them turned up from all over Europe over a period of four months. For £50, you can have a ""drive-through mannequin heist"" to fill up your car. ""I'll be honest, even in daylight, this place feels a little creepy. There is something unsettling about being surrounded by not-quite-human figures in every direction,"" says the owner of COVID, a company that re-hires unwanted manneqins for use in film and TV. The company's name is a deliberate misspelling for the company name, ""manna"", food from heaven, and ""kin"", kindred spirit, because it was almost gifted to me during a time when really I had nothing. They are made in China, but most of the time they're made in the UK, they go into shops, and they do sell them in UK, but they don't do the hire because there's a lot of work involved, but there's no way of knowing how much work is involved in making them. ""It's really bonkers, really, out of this world, so that has attracted quite a different film crews, not just horror films, which is the obvious one, but also music videos,"" says owner of the company."
223,The Thames Barrier must never fail. Here's why it doesn't.,"If the Thames Barrier were to fail when it was needed, the damage would be almost impossible to calculate. The Houses of Parliament, every skyscraper in the city of London, every building near the river would be unusable for weeks. Worst case, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people who'd be forced out of their homes. The barrier has three connections to the UK power grid, for both the north and south of the river. It has three separate diesel generators, any one of which could operate the entire thing. Each gate can be moved by one of four separate motors. There are two of them, a few metres apart, identical, with completely independent power and control systems. The steel gates are protected by what's called a sacrificial Corrosion in water like this. So if you connect a chunk of metal that's more easily corroded to something like the gate, that will take something like a couple of centuries at least to stand up to the test of time. And if the Prime Minister stood in the House of Commons and we said, ""Sorry, PM, we'll get it right next tide,"" that would probably be fairly career-limiting. But we always say that if we need to close when we need it to, we always close it."
224,The town where holding fireworks over your head is a tradition,"Across Britain, a lot of towns and villages have all sorts of strange, old traditions for Bonfire Night, on November the 5th. Most of those traditions involve fire, pyrotechnics, and a significant chance of personal injury to anyone taking part. This is Bridgwater, in southwest England, and today, I'll be holding a terrifying amount of pyrotehnics directly above my head, in a big parade with a couple of hundred other people. This isn't going to be a normal video, because honestly, I'm not really sure what happens next. I have no script beyond this point. They just said, ""Do you want to be in the squibbing display?"" And... I said yes. Well, I've never actually been invited to take part before. It's like, any of these traditional, regional things that it wouldn't be allowed if you were to ask anywhere else in the world to do it now. In England in particular, they would not allow it. How do you keep it safe then? 'Cause obviously, there's a lot. of gunpowder, and there's gonna be crowds around in the street. And once I'm happy that they all in place, you'll see a seam of fire going down through the centre of the road. Then you just pull off the safety cover, and once those wads are lit, you hear the second horn..."
225,The tunnel where people pay to inhale radioactive gas,"Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that's produced naturally by uranium decay. A few places in the world where people go to be exposed to radon deliberately for pain relief. The dose is, per one hour treatment, between 30-60 thousand bequerels. On average you need ten treatments, one hour. At the end, the application will have a dose of around about 2.2 millisieverts. The video should have gone out weeks ago. But despite filming going really well on location, despite being really happy with my script and the interview at the time, I just wasn't comfortable with it when I got back here to the UK. There's just enough evidence here that this unqualified skeptic can't do it immediately, not immediately. And there's all this infrastructure for handling radioactive gas as well as the fact that there's a radon spa in Bad Kreuznach. It's a medical application where you need a prescription. And at the end of the report, 85% of the patients, they helped it worked, at least enough to discuss enough to at least discuss it at the least. Just to make it interesting. We not promise miracles. We do not promise something weird. We're not trying to do something weird, we're just trying to discuss it."
226,This tiny railroad across the sea has an important job,"The Hallig islands in Germany are protected by hundreds of kilometers of sandbars and mudflats that act as a natural wave break and storm defense. People who live on the islands have their own personal trains to get them to and from the mainland. The reason behind it is to stop these islands, and eventually the mainland, being flooded by rising seas. If you're building sea defenses in the 1930s and you need to get a load of heavy material across a tidal flat, well, rail is your most efficient option. But unfortunately  I'm not allowed to fly a drone here because this is a wildlife reserve. But there's a bigger question: why is there a tiny railroad here? Who builds a railroad instead of just... a road? It seems strange to describe an island as something that needs to be kept healthy, but yeah, that's why the railway's here. But one of the reasons that the railway is still in regular use is that it's still helping to build the sea defenses. Manage these islands correctly, you'll protect all the cities on the mainland from flooding. Plus, people have lived on these islands for centuries now. They'll happily take the storm defense for themselves. And the free railroad that comes with it. And it looks quirky and interesting. Very rarely, if they're staying on the island, tourists can ride too."
227,Why this falling rocks sign is more important than most,"A Swiss village has installed a radar that can detect rockfalls and close the road. If the radar detects rockfall in a certain defined area, it triggers an alarm. The traffic lights go red, and then the radar tracks the rockfall. If it stops or it ends up in the dam, then the traffic light switches off, goes back to normal, the road is safe to pass. Since installation, we've detected five and a half thousand events. We've got about 40 seconds from detachment to a rock reaching the road, and this is just enough for the cars to escape the dangerous area. They have to drive a certain velocity, otherwise they can't get away. And this is why cyclists are not allowed on this road. And their logs now have thousands of rockfalls where the lights did turn red. So I'd say: they probably got it about right. I mean, I know it was too much to hope for, I was just hoping  there'd be just a little rock fall as I finished? Just... just like a little one. Not doing any damage. Just a few. Let's do that again without worrying  that a rock's going to hit me. We don't have a lot of false alarms.  It's very rare that we closed the road because of something else, for example, an approaching rain front that could look kind of similar."
228,The shooting range where you fire over a busy road,"Rifle shooting is a national sport in Switzerland. Service in the military is compulsory for men, albeit these days with the choice to take on civilian public service work instead. For those who do choose military service, a lot of them decide to keep their firearm when they finish. They pretty much all have thorough training in how to use them. If you're shooting a rifle here, you're lying down and you cannot see the road. Anything you fire that's traveling fast enough to go over that wall just can't hit the road, that just isn't a possible trajectory for a bullet that can damage anything other than the hill and, of course, the targets. If someone wants to cause harm with a gun,  this is not the way they'd do it. Joining a rifle club, getting all the permits and then deciding to throw all that away to take a potshot at a car just once? I'm not sure there's anyone who's sensible enough to do the first bits of that. And if there is, they've never made it here. And also, breaking the safety rules when you're surrounded by military-trained firearm enthusiasts is...  not a great plan? ""What if you stand up"" is basically the same question as ""what if you decide to point the rifle at someone""?"
229,The world's only float-through McDonalds,"The world's only ""float-through McDonald's"" is on a canal on the Elbe River in Germany. You have to order on the smartphone app. In the winter, we may close, yes. But in summer and in spring, we have 24/7. People are so happy to see this because they read this or saw this on Instagram and they come especially for this. And one person goes on, and brings the bag out and wishes them a good, ""Enjoy your meal"" and a happy ""good day"" The McBoat is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It is located in Hamburg, Germany, but I didn't mention exactly where in Germany we are. Because it is quite apt that the world's Only float- through McDonald's......is in Hamburg. It's quite apt because it isquite apt that it is in Hamburg......and it's called the 'McBoat' It's on a little canal in Germany, and it's open 24 hour a week. It’s called the ‘McB Boat’. It was opened in Hamburg in July 2015. There is no sign of a moat around it, just a line of kayaks lining up for each window."
230,I thought the Schmid Peoplemover was impossible,"The Schmid Peoplemover has been doing exactly that for about 20 years. It locks onto a carrier device and a counterweight, with safety systems that are roughly equivalent to a regular elevator. The closest analogy I can come up with is that it's a bit like closing an up-and-over garage door. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's better than nothing. It requires much less land than a regular footbridge does. And if you have heavy or bulky bags, well, you don't have to haul them in and out of multiple elevators and across the footbridge, it just takes them across for you. It's very clever. It solves a specific problem. But when there are more common and more reliable alternatives that are just a bit more hassle to install... well, not many places wanted to take the risk. It took me a long time to understand how this works, and how it works safely. I had to hire an engineering consultant to look at the original patents and break it down for me. And also, with the help of a producer in Germany... I tracked down the inventor. Only three of these have ever actually been installed.  Only two of them still exist. And that also means that if you are late for your train and physically able, you can just run up, across, and down the foot bridge instead of waiting for the peoplemover to arrive."
231,The world's most useful model railway,"The world's most useful model railway is based in Darmstadt, Germany. It's a fictional layout, 1.2 kilometres long, with a track laid out. But it works like a real signal box, with levers and pulleys to turn points. And it's not possible to pull them back. You can't even close the lever. So we have to put down the button and produce electricity to produce some electricity. And now the train sees a green signal and he can move on. It kind of simulates, because he has to release his brakes before he can start. So what we need to do now is another thing to lock the line. So that's the next thing that's coming, that's electromechechech. And the next ones came, which is called Interlocking which is a manual ones, which came a few years ago. They are taking exams here. So these are the oldest systems on the Deutsche Bahn network. Everything is worked manually. We had a similar facility since 1936. We have about 500 square metres of space available for the trainings. We are training actual signalmen here. And then we justLast step is put the signal to an off position. Which is going to be... The P2. P2, all right. Just like point number one and two."
232,The public toll road with no speed limit,"The Nürburgring Nordschleife is the longest permanent racetrack in the world. There is no speed limit on most of the track, because Germany has no national speed limit. The track is unforgiving, with sections where you will-oh my God-get what roller coaster fans would call air time. Nearly every German insurance company has a clause in there that excludes driving here, even if you are just a tourist. In case of a heavier accident, then the track gets closed of a normal breakdown, and then I can see why it's just getting yellow. First of all, we've got an emergency number and permanent marshals here in the entrance. We've got special permission for these cameras, but none of these cars should have dashcams or timers because it is just too dangerous......it is too dangerous to have a clock ticking either on your dashboard or in your head. And of course, which cars finally fit to us, that's 2.8 tonnes, is the max. People driving here round with their Porsche, but you've also got a family driving in their van here round. If you are conscious, you will be delivered a bill for damage. That story is absolutely, 100%... true. It's just that it'll go to your insurance company, not you."
233,Three strange river crossings,"The Hulmes Ferry goes over the Manchester Ship Canal, which is more than a century old. A few kilometres west is the Thelwall Ferry, which charges 11 pence to cross. About 600 crossings a year, they say there's barely anyone, and some days a whole walking club might turn up. The Warburton Toll Bridge is a toll bridge for a car, and costs 25 pence a day if you want to pass. The third crossing inbetween those two ferries is the Warburtshire Bridge, which costs 25p a day to pass, and is a Toll Bridge for cars. It's an hour's walk to get to the other side, but unless you happen to live really close to one side and work reallyclose to the others, it's not much use. And my travel on it was logged, one more on the count of ""people who actually use this ferry"". And I'll get back to why that happened later. And I'm honest. I was relying on secondary sources, newspaper articles and quotes. I don't like doing that, but from the look of some of those articles, they've turn down requests from other people. Which is fair, they're absolutely within their rights to do that. And the second reason that I'm sorta-improvising here and on on... I only travelled to Manchester yesterday!"
234,I took the world's shortest flight. It was underwhelming.,"The Orkney Islands are a sparsely-populated archipelago. The vast majority of their 22,000-strong population lives on what's known as the ""mainland"" The outer islanders need ways of getting to the mainland, but bridges are expensive, especially over some of the longer interisland spans in the Orkneys. Therefore, the answer is airplanes. Loganair uses a network design referred to as a ""milk run"" This aggregates demand of two islands onto one, allowing for operations to each more regularly than if they both had dedicated flights. Altogether, this means the only people that might take the flight between Papa Westray and Westray are aviation enthusiasts and tourists who make the pilgrimage to fly on the world's shortest commercial flight.

235,"I helped cover a 5,000-year-old monument with worn-out tires","The Ness of Brodgar is a huge Neolithic complex discovered in 2002. It is a place of gathering, 5000 years ago. Neolithic society wasn't a static society and through the thousand years that the Ness was in use, we see those changes reflected in the architecture. We cover the site with layers of plastic, then to hold all those covers in place, all these hundreds of tires. The old tires are a practical solution. They're free, they're heavy but they can be moved fairly easily. And they're just soft enough not to cause damage when they're on top of the plastic sheeting. It means the site is still going to be there, intact. When spring comes and archeology can start again, we have to protect it. We have to do this to the best of our abilities, because these walls have stood for over 5,000 years. And it's a top priority for us to hopefully keep them there and keep them in prime condition for the next 5,00 years. To be honest, they didn't actually need the tire there. They just gave me one so I could be out of the way of the volunteers who are doing the actual hard work. To see the rest of the documentary, visit CNN.com."
236,The diving gondola: a strange elevator to the ocean floor,"The Tauchgondel, the diving gondola, feels like it should be some 19th-century Industrial Revolution invention. It’s a diving bell: a chamber that sinks under the water and lets you look out on the ocean floor. The novelty is being on what is, to be fair, an actual short diving expedition without needing scuba equipment or a wetsuit. But the folks here were worried that people might be disappointed if they didn’t see anything... so they actually close the shutters and show a 3D film. It is a little unnerving seeing the ocean rise around you, out of your control, and it's also a bit reassuring to surface again into the sunshine. Because in the end, it's not about the fish. It's about the experience. The technology here is modern. And with modern technology comes modern safety standards. The average tourist isn't going to be worried that it might fall, but they are going to ask if it might get stuck down there. Or worse, that it may, uh......spring a leak. [horn sounds] [mechanical noises] Ha! Okay. I did not expect that. Just... having a wave right in your face is weird. I didn't expect the sound. I don't know why."
237,I tried to film a volcano and it was a complete disaster,"Iceland has a new volcano, and it's close to the airport, and relatively easy to get to. So the plan was: film a video with a flowing river of lava behind me. But the video ended up being a disaster, there's no other word to describe it. And I have learned quite a bit of stuff about how Iceland is handling tourists flocking to its new and dangerous volcano. So, from the outskirts of Reykjavik airport, here's a story that didn't work how I expected it to, but which I hope is still interesting. The Graph is data from the Iceland Meterological Office's sensors, and they track the rumblings at certain frequencies at all the seismic locations around Iceland. When the graph for this volcano is high, it's erupting. When it's low, It's quiet. It's been erupting for a long time now. And activity is low, andIt's trending downwards. There will be no new lava for... maybe for just the day. Or maybe it's all over and it'll never erupt again. But okay. I can still make the best of this. And so I do. And it's not quite as dramatic as you might think. “In March 2021, Fagradsads, let's do that again, sorry! “"
238,"The UK's last aerial ropeway uses no power, moves 300 tonnes a day, and will be gone by 2036.","This is the last aerial ropeway in Britain. It's nearly a hundred years old. It needs no fuel and no electricity to run. And in 15 years time, it'll be gone. It takes about half an hour for a round trip. There used to be hundreds of these ropeways around Britain. But the financial crisis in the late 2000s meant the quarry and brickworks shut down for a few years. But it was kept in working order and as of now, as of December, it's still transporting rock. Permission for quarrying was going to end in 2018 but the local planning department granted an extension. There's still a lot of shale in the hill up there and that could be extended in theory, but in theory that works in theory it's not going to happen. Claughton produces frost-resistant product. That's down to the shale from the quarry, that's a vital key to it. The temperature we fire at and also the durability of the ceramic bond. That means we can sell this product into all extreme weathers. Unfortunately, it has to cross the road, but it is a possibility. So we have a steel bridge with big bucket-catchers on the side that would prevent that happening. The rope construction is a 25mm steel rope. Very difficult to get contractors these days who are skilled in splicing ropes of that size."
239,How many robots does it take to run a grocery store?,"The Hive is a grocery packing warehouse in the south-east of London. Instead of trying to build machines that fit into a world designed for humans, this entire facility is custom-built to make this as efficient as possible. We have around 2,300 bots and they move the stock around the warehouse, so that we can pair it up with customer orders to be delivered. The top speed of those boxes is about 14 kilometres an hour and they pass within five millimetres of each other when they move. There are things that the robot can't pack, things such as very, very heavy, very large or very fragile items, but there's a lot of range in between that. The Hive Mind will tell the bots exactly where they need to stop, but it is the bot's control system that allows it to follow a movement profile and stop exactly as the hive mind expects it to. The boundary between ""individual"" and ""group"" is a little blurry. Is a colony of individuals working together, like a superorganism, in your gut? Is the microbiome a collection of individuals, working together or one big big group? Is there a connection between the human body and the microbiome? Is it possible to have a human-to-human connection with the gut?"

241,The Accidental Rush for Anthrax Island,"Gruinard Island, on the west coast of Scotland, is not a tourist destination. But if you really do want to get closer, there is a way. In World War 2, this is where Britain tested its biological weapons. It was contaminated for decades, and landing was dangerous and illegal. But in the 1980s, the island was decontaminated. And it was being sold for £500 back to the original owners. But there was a catch there. The original contract from the 1940s specified that once the. island was safe again, the people who'd sold it to the government would have the option of buying it back. For the same price, they'd pay £500. What this did not mean was that this was a bargain and £500 was the price, but that the price was worth much more than that. And there was another story that stood out to me. It's a story that I don't think has ever been told, because in context it's a fairly minor detail. But the trouble is that the press can sometimes gloss over some of those details as the decontamination story went out in newspapers and TV broadcasts and several TV departments found themselves dealing with the story. So it's not just the story of the island, it's the whole thing."
242,The beach where Lego keeps washing up,"In 1997, a container ship called Tokio Express was on its way to New York when it got hit by a heavy storm. A load of containers got knocked into the sea, and one of them contained almost 5 million little plastic pieces of Lego. Most of which were ocean themed. The far end of this beach has the right conditions. There's a huge expanse of sand, the wind is in the right direction, but the pieces can wash up anywhere. We find the Lego after high spring tides and winter storms. And that's when the waves will eat into the dunes and release a lot of the plastic that's been washed ashore many years ago. That's Tracey Williams. She's been beachcombing here for years and runs a photography project called Lego Lost at Sea. Tracey didn't want to be on camera, which is frankly sensible. But she was nice enough to show off some of her Lego collection, and to chat about what she's found over the years. So if you look here, see. Absolutely full. These are from packaging strips. Shotgun wads, shotgun cartridges. Bottle caps. It's not just Lego, that's the way people like to tell it but it's so many plastic things and it's notjust this beach. Once you start looking... immediately, bright white, bright blue, bright yellow."
243,England's oldest attraction turns teddy bears to stone,"Mother Shipton's Cave in Knaresborough, Yorkshire, has been open for 400 years. It was bought by Sir Charles Slingsby from King Charles I in 1630. The water in the cave acts like stalactites forming in a cave or limescale building up on your plumbing. A teddy bear turns to stone in three months, anything bigger would take six months to a year. The other remarkable thing about the water is it flows at the same rate all the time. It's never flood or drought or flood again: it's one of the wonders of the ice age. The cave is open to the public, but there is a fee for guided tours of the cave and the park. The park used to belong to the Royal Family, but now it's run by a private company. It has a pool shaped like a skull that turns things to stone. The material isn't being replaced with stone, but at the risk of making some chemists angry at me, I think it's close enough. The teddy bears, the hats, the whatever's in here, it's steadily being coated in minerals over and over again. And if it's solid enough, it becomes stone. Linguistically, it turns to be stone."
244,This changed my mind about aquariums.,"The Deep aquarium in Hull has a life-support system. The water inside the exhibit is constantly recirculating between the exhibit and the system. Water starts off, just as it would in your home, out of the tap. Inside here, we have a lot of bio-balls, and that is a huge, huge surface area. If these walls are somehow breached, fish are dead. And if that environment isn't controlled  and maintained carefully, they're also dead. So, just we have to alter the mixture of air and gas. Now, this is part of the building, so it's so huge. But if it's not breached quickly, those inside will die. And that takes a lot more precision and precision than you might think. So we're also pumping into it into it, pumping it into ozone. So this is where we alter the air andgas mixture. Now this is the part on our large system, on this skimmer, where we have this small fractionator on this scale of our smaller life- support systems. This is all scaled up on a huge scale for things like our large 2.5-million-litre system. We are a closed system. There's no input or output to the oceans whatsoever. We have to control, including making our own seawater. We then pump it around where needed around the building."
245,No-one is going to save Covehithe,"Covehithe, on the south-east coast of Britain, will be gone by the end of the century. The cliffs here get eroded a little bit with every high tide, steadily being pushed back and back. The landowners here did offer to build their own coastal defences back in 2011, to add breakwaters here as an experiment to see if the erosion could be slowed. But they were turned down by the council, who said: ""It is not considered sustainable to attempt to manage the erosion"" A little way down the coast is Southwold, home to a thousand people and a lot of tourism. And the simulations say that if Covehithe stops eroding, then SouthWold would probably start. Or at least, they'd need much, much stronger defences. But if you do happen to be somewhere in the area in the next few years, it might be worth stopping by to see Cove hithe... while you can. It's a picturesque little village. There's the ruins of a church more than 600 years old, with a more recent church built inside. And by more recent, I mean the little church is only 400 years old. This has been a settlement for at least a thousand years, possibly more. And it'll be gone in 100 years."
246,The never-used road where the BBC crash cars,"Road to Nowhere is 400m of never-completed 1970s highway in Yate, south-west England. Public can't drive on this road, though: it's gated off. Local council makes it available for filming, the whole area is closed occasionally. Broadchurch used careful angles and one composite shot to make it look like a coast road. Hospital drama Casualty have shot quite a few things here over the 36 years they've been in production. That includes their most expensive scenes ever, which involved a huge fake bridge, crashing vehicles, adding a CGI town around the road, and setting off an enormous tanker explosion. For all it cost, it's actually a little bit underwhelming? Maybe that's a creative decision,  maybe it looks more realistic that way. And it's convincing enough. This is an accidental film set. At some point, some British studio would  probably have built one of these anyway, it just wouldn't look as good. So the question is: why did this happen? I don't actually know. I gave up on researching this project half way through. There are still occasional vague  political calls to complete it, but I would be very surprised  if there's any traffic other than stunt drivers and dog walkers on the Road to Now nowhere any time soon."
247,We walked the most dangerous path in Britain,"Foulness Island is owned by the British military and they will turn you away. But despite having no business here, I am on the island, legally. And that's because I didn't use the road and bridge. I walked along a very different path to get here. The Broomway has been called the most dangerous, most deadly path in Britain. It goes back at least 600 years. And the only reason that I walked here safely is because I had a guide. It's very easy to get lost out there, particularly in low-visibility conditions when it's raining or there's low fog, early morning, late at night. The main thing is the tide. It whips round from the North Sea and would come from, not as you expect, straight on from the horizon, but it'll often spiral in to the coastline, and so it'll cut you off from your pathway. The MOD use this as an active firing range, and they have done since the late 1800s. Shell craters are also a problem because of the exploded ordnance that has gone off, so it's essentially quick sand. And so, there'll be pockets of sand which are really soft and mushy that your feet will sink into that we have to be careful of. Permanently closing a right-of-way in Britain is difficult."
248,"If these pumps ever stop, part of Germany floods.","The Ruhr Valley in Germany used to be a mining region. It used to produce huge amounts of anthracite, the sort of coal that you have to dig deep, deep tunnels to reach. The last deep coal mine here closed at the end of 2018 as the world steadily shifts to renewables. But you can see the legacy of that mining in the landscape, in places like this. Strange hills which are old spoil tips. Dumping sites for everything that was dug up, that wasn't coal. All the earth and rock that was moved out of the way to create the mine shafts. They're steadily being reclaimed. Trees have been planted all over. And several of them now have art like this at the top. I visited one art piece called the Tetrahedron yesterday. And honestly it felt like I was on some sort of alien planet from a sci-fi show. There are around 180 pumping stations, large and small, across this valley. After a heavy storm, it will move up to 40,000 litres of water every second. But running the pumps is an eternal cost. Not technically eternal, I guess. But this won't go away in 100, or 1,000, or 10,000 years. Not until something equally dramatic and geological comes along to reshape the land."
249,The theme park inside an old nuclear power plant,"Wunderland Kalkar is a theme park opened in 2001. Each year, they get about 280,000 visitors. Two-thirds of the buildings at the moment are still empty. There's a carousel, there's the teacups the elephants, and there's also a very nice rollercoaster here in the park. One of the important things we've got is in the cooling tower, that's the Vertical Swing. The season continues for a couple of weeks as this video goes live, and then they'll be open again next year. Thank you so much to everyone at WunderlandKalkar. You shouldn't expect hyper-coasters or anything with the polish of Disney, but they do have one unique ride. It's just an off-the-shelf Star Flyer, you can ride those a lot of places in the world, but not inside a cooling tower. And the view is spectacular. Oh, I should not have looked down. I shouldn't have looked up. I should have been looking down. It was a nuclear power plant ready to go in Germany and then public protests and political problems meant that the whole project was postponed for a long, long while. Then Chernobyl happened in Ukraine and the tide of public opinion changed even further, and the wholeProject was just cancelled."
250,"Swimming between two continents, debunked","Iceland's Bridge Between Continents claims to be the point where the two continental plates are breaking apart. But the two cracks, this and Silfra, aren't connected. This is just one of many places where the rocks happened to be a little bit weaker, so this is where they broke in two to let this whole area... stretch. The real world is messy, and continents don't split at a single line. But this bridge is symbolic. It's where one of the cracks happened to breach an underground river. Swimming there is, technically, swimming in between the continents. And because it's glacial meltwater, ""it's also only just above freezing point, about about 2-3°C, ""so I need to wear a dry suit to prevent hypothermia. And yes, my camera lens keeps fogging up, ""I tried to do a piece to camera while I was in the water ""but it didn't go well."" [unintelligible wet microphone noises] Here's what true:Silfra is a crack in the earth, and it is between two tectonic plates. If you're diving there, you are 100% diving in betweenThe real world does not fit into the neat boxes that we'd like it to."
251,Is the most northern part of Iceland still there?,"Despite its reputation for being cold and northern, Iceland is not above the Arctic Circle. There is one part of a tiny island called Grímsey, north of Akureyri. A small, uninhabitable bit of rock called Kolbeinsey is another 60km further north. Iceland built a helipad on there to try to stop it eroding, but in 2006 the Coast Guard reported that it had collapsed. It might not seem like that matters, but tiny places like that can make a difference, because countries' territorial limits and exclusive fishing areas are sometimes decided by rocks like that. But it does feel a bit provocative for me, as a British person, to be checking up on whether Iceland's rock is still there. We're flying out, right now, to the co-ordinates of where Kol beinsey might be. Or might not be. We are flying only 500 feet above the waves, that's about 150m. It's low tide. The weather is clear. I think I can see it! I'm sure that if there was ever a chance to see it, this is it. Oh, man, there's barely anything left. That used to be an island, and that's all that's left. And yes, it's eroded away, but it looks like it's still poking above water."
252,The Abandoned Hill With Two Members Of Parliament,"Old Sarum in Wiltshire was once a thriving bit of England. A castle was built for William the Conqueror and the Catholic church built a cathedral here. The clergy moved a couple of miles away to a new cathedral, in a place that would eventually become known as Salisbury. The buildings here started to fall into disrepair and the once-busy town declined. But despite that, for some reason, the landowners of Old Sarum were invited to send two representatives to Parliament in the 14th century. By the 17th century, no one lived here but you didn't have to live here to vote. Anyone who was nominated by the landowner as being one of the tenants in this area, that was enough. And of course they voted for the person who'd nominated them. For centuries, a quarter of a million people had representatives representing them at all. By 19th century it was clear that something had to be done, but how do you convince people with power to give that power? Public outrage. Protests, including one where 60,000 people were attacked by the military which came to be known as the Peterloo Massacre. In May 1832, riots broke out when the third attempt at reform was blocked in Parliament. After all the French Revolution was still very much living in memory, very much a threat of the real threat of revolution."
253,The first internet bench probably wasn't,"In 2001, there were no smartphones. Wifi did technically exist, but it wasn't widespread. Mobile internet was limited to a few specially coded, tiny black and white sites. If you wanted an internet connection in 2001, your computer had to be plugged in somehow. A bench with sockets you could plug your computer's modem into, and dial up to the internet over a phone line. This was all a publicity stunt for MSN, the Microsoft Network. And here I am, 20 years later, still giving them that attention because it still gets them that, World's First Internet Bench. It's a silly story that doesn't matter. The press are fine with it. They've got content and sold the adverts around it. And we've seen this same bench swapped out for a different one occasionally in the past. It was never the right location, and the bench was never working. But then the bench never worked at all, and it was never going to work. This wasn't about connecting the town of Bury St Edmunds or blazing a trail into the future, it was about getting cheap advertising. The truth is malleable. You just have to tell a story that resonates, get the press in to take some pictures, and figure they don't know enough about the subject to ask technical questions. And then after you've got those column inches and retweets and clicks, you can basically abandon the whole project."
254,This billion-euro nuclear reactor was never switched on,"Austria built three nuclear reactors along the Danube River in the 1970s. The decision to build the reactors was controversial and led to a public referendum. 50.5% of the people voted against nuclear power. The owners decided to conservate the reactor in the hope that politicians would change their mind. The plant is now a training centre, a filming location, and an occasional tourist attraction. It's the only one on the planet where this 1970s dream of the atomic age can be preserved, if only by accident. Many thanks to Stefan Zach and all the team at EVN who gave us so much access to this incredible place. You can find out more at the link in the link below, or visit EVN's website here: http://www.evn.com/en/news/stories/nuclear-power-reactor-in-zwentendorf-and-how-it-changed-the-world-for-us-by-50-years-ago-we-have-a-new-look-at-our-atomic-history-from-70s-to-present-days-we're-very-excited-to examine-this-special-piece-of-Austrian-history."
255,The country where all public transit is free,"From Sunday, March 1st, all public transit in the entire country will be free. A ticket valid for a full day on every bus, tram, and train in the country is €4. The whole transit network costs the government €700 million a year to operate, but all the tickets sold add up to just 10% of that. Luxembourg, though, is the first country to abolish fares entirely, and partly that's because it can afford to do it. The country is a small, rich tax haven. The thing is, public transit here is almost free already. One needs to look at the price of the transit is the social issue in Luxembourg. The cities who are doing this investment into public transport will be, from a competitive point of view, in the world, the winning cities. That's an important point for someone like me, who's a tourist with a travel budget, but for someone who has to commute on an hour or two hours a day. So it might be financially sound to live in Belgium, France and Germany, buy a house and buy a couple of cars, but it would be a lot of money to live from a house in Luxembourg, or France or Germany. It would be more financially sound for people to move there."
256,The Dutch headwind cycling championships are amazing,"The Dutch headwind cycling championships take place today. The course is eight and a half brutal kilometres. At high speed, up to 90% of the drag on a cyclist is from air resistance. The difference between cycling in a 15 km/h headwind and a 120km/h gust is 64 times the added drag. It's a serious event, with permissions and everything. We have a limit of 300 participants. All the bikes are the same. No gears, and just an ordinary brake. And it's a typical dutch bike. Have you done it? Yes, two times. How difficult is it? Very. I do triathlon in my spare time and it's just as hard. Why are you doing this? I don't know. [laughs] I really don’t know. But this is a good place for it. Because not only are humans literally pushing against the storm and saying, ""we can beat you"", they are on a physical monument to doing just that. There's a big rock in the middle of the barrier, with an inscription that translates as ""Here the tide is ruled by the wind, the moon and us"". And sure, it's also a good, weird human interest story, right? People are doing a deliberately difficult thing and hurting themselves just enough that it's interesting."
257,The bridge that's in two countries at the same time,"Luxembourg and Germany share the Moselle River north of France. Under treaties they signed, they both have full control over it. If you stand on that bridge above the water, all of you is in both countries simultaneously. This international border is a shape, not a line. It's two-dimensional. Although, actually, I guess it’s three-dimensional if you count depth. It was here – actually, on a boat out at that tripoint, where the Schengen agreement was signed, where most of the countries of the EU, all the ones that have their flags here, decided to open their internal borders. I can’t tell you why they made that decision, or what the legal result would be if you tried to commit a crime on that Bridge or on a Boat on the river. Although they do have a lovely little display of all the border guard hats that the ScheNGen agreement made obsolete. I suspect that the answer would be “treat it as if it's a line, it's easier” And that’S what I mean when I say that there's not much to talk about here. Because that's one of the wonderful things about borders like this: when you can walk between three countries as easily as you can walked between counties or towns or neighbourhoods. It’'s a lot easier to just on with your life."
258,The world's littlest skyscraper was a massive scam,"The Newby-McMahon Building is the World's Littlest Skyscraper. It cost $200,000, which is about $3 million in today's money. The investors thought that it was going to be 12 times as tall because the blueprints they thought were marked in feet were actually in inches. The developer, J.D. McMahon, ran off with most of the money, all that was left over from only having to construct a tiny building. The building sat abandoned for a long time and it was renovated in the early 21st century and these days, it's a furniture boutique. It's a great story that sends tourists to their town. But the original plans that allegedly he had given to his investors, they don't exist, as far as I know. So I started to fact-check it and I came up blank. I tracked down every article I could on every database I could access, but they were too modern and all the references ran out, usually somewhere in the '80s. There are references to a ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" panel from the 1920, but I emailed the archivists at Ripley's and they said their archives are incomplete. They don't have a copy of it. And if we're honest here, if I had to hunt through microfilm and scan and scan in the headlines, I couldn't find a mention of it here."
259,The world's only wingsuit tunnel,"Jarno Cordia is part of the world champion wingsuit skydiving team. He teaches people to fly in the world's only diagonal wind tunnel. Cordia says the difference between flying in the air and in the tunnel is definitely the lack of space. He also says the best training you get in the sky doesn't get you as much feedback as in the wind tunnel because you see every little move in terms of static, so you learn much faster in it. The world record is six and a half hours non-stop in a wind tunnel without touching the floor, walls or anything, which is the most boring thing I've ever done, but somehow the most watched thing, and it's flying six-and-a-half hours without touching anything. He says the most important thing to remember when you're flying is that you don't have the best effect on the sides of you or that you have to put your arms in front of you to keep you from falling to the floor or to the side of you, so that's a big thing that is definitely different to the ground. He adds: ""If I'm flying with a partner, when we're having a little bit of movement between each other, we don't see who is making the movement between us"""
260,The giant art that keeps planes quiet,"Human hearing in a healthy, young person runs from somewhere up around 20,000 cycles a second, all the way down to 20. The eardrum can pick up air movements with wavelengths that range from a couple of centimetres for high frequencies, to 10 or 20 metres for really low bass. The sort of low, rumbling bass that you would get from, say, a jet engine. This is a park that serves two purposes: one, to be land art, the sort of high-concept big sculpture that's created by moving enormous amounts of earth and rock. But the second purpose is sound dampening. These ridges are metres apart, roughly, very roughly, around the same wavelength as the low rumble you get from a jet engines. So rather than the sound waves just rolling over the land, instead they're scattered in all directions, up and away, not onwards. The architects claim that one of the inspirations for this was people noticing that the engine noise sounded quieter when the fields were ploughed. Because, yes, your brain can filter out constant, steady noise. It can even, over time, get used to filtering out intermittent, loud noise, like living next to an airport. But that filtering job is a lot easier if the noise would just be a little less loud."
261,"These tunnels are designed for 100,000 years","There is no permanent geologic storage facility anywhere for high-level radioactive waste. Finland is closest to building that solution. High-level waste will be disposed of with cast-iron copper canisters. The canisters are put into the hole in the deposition tunnels and then these are surrounded by bentonite clay. There are multiple levels of containment. The idea is that if one or two of them fail, everything will still be safe, even if someone digs it up. But there were all sorts of ideas from a spike field to 'bidding blocks of radiation' But ultimately, no one knows what is under the ground and no-one knows what has fallen apart. How do you warn people away? Even if our civilization has collapsed, our language has fallen away, too. We need to find a way to tell people to stay away from these tombs. And we need to make sure that when we open them, we don't open them for the wrong reasons, and that we leave them in a state of good health and safety for the next 100,000 years. And that's what we're trying to do in Olkiluoto, an island on the far west of Finland. And here, they're building a tomb for something that really is dangerous. And in a few years, the deep bedrock will contain the world's first long-term storage site."
262,The toxic pit with a $3 admission fee,"35,000 tourists a year visit the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana. It is a mile wide, and so deep that you could fit the new One World Trade Center standing upright in it. The rock here is full of iron pyrite. Combine that with oxygen and water and as it rusts, you get sulfuric acid. That in turn, breaks down other metals and minerals in the rock. And the result is that the water down there is so acidic and so contaminated with toxins that nothing except a few hardy bugs can live in the water. In 2016, thousands of geese died in one night after a snowstorm forced them down there. In 2007, the University of Colorado, Boulder, coined the term 'toxic tourism' The fact that people will come to take a gawp or be shocked or just take a selfie is a codified idea of capitalism. And it seems almost normal to pay for a ticket to see the roadside attraction. And there are much worse places out there. And we need to raise the awareness and tell the world, hey, this is pretty screwed up and we need something to do about it and this is a good place to go to find out how to fix it. If the Berkeleypit is not maintained, the protective water level would be reached in July of 2023. Later this year will be the first time since 1982 that the pit water level will be maintained and held steady."
263,The only bit of Louisiana's coast that isn't sinking,"Louisiana has lost nearly 2,000 square miles' worth of land over the last century. The Wax Lake Outlet was built in the early 1940s and it was designed to pull water off the Atchafalaya River and reduce flood stress on Morgan City. One of the unintended consequences was the development of a delta at the mouth of the Wax Lake outlet. This is solid enough land that you can walk on it and you can stand on it. It's important to restore the coast, one, to push back the sea to enhance flood protection, and it's also important to bury carbon in the atmosphere. But the more difficult thing to model is how people are going to behave with this changing coast. We don't even know what the rules are to deal with a stressful environment. So yes, yes, it's still under wet feet here right now because this whole area's still in flood. And I feel like that, even though we barely know even what the equations are, we're still in a flood area right now. We're talking tens of millions of metric tonnes of sediment every year. And so, people like myself want to study the Wax. Lake Delta so we can better design restoration projects. We have too much CO2 in the environment and highly productive deltas may be one of those places that we can do that."
264,These tunnels stop part of Tokyo flooding,"The city of Tokyo is built around and over rivers. As the climate breaks down, rain storms here are getting more intense and more frequent. If you want to prevent river flooding, or drain neighbourhoods that are starting to flood, where do you put the water? The best plan would be to pump the floodwater all the way to the ocean, or at least to a tidal river that can deal with it. But for that, you would need tunnels and buffer tanks on an almost unimaginable scale. This tank, and the kilometres of tunnels and all the silos that bring water to it, cost nearly a quarter of a trillion yen, that's about two billion US dollars, at the end of the 20th century. It took a national recession to make this happen. A plan like this only works if a government wants to spend a colossal amount of money, and in the 21st century, there aren't many governments willing to do that. You can find out more about them and their work at the link in the description. Echo! [echoes continue and fade] That goes for a long time. That goes to the long-term security of the city. I am not allowed down on the floor, just in case. There was a massive rainstorm about two days ago, and there is still water in the system."
265,The world's first solar powered train,"The Byron Bay Railroad Company in Australia has converted a 70-year-old vintage train to be 100% solar powered. The train is powered by 6½ kilowatts of solar panels on the roof of the train and a 30 kilowatt array on top of the platform. The battery on this train is roughly the same size as you'd find in an electric car. In the first year of service we put 60,000kilowatt-hours back into the grid which is enough to power 17 three-bedroom houses. This isn't something that would work everywhere or even that should work everywhere. This is a small independent railway with one bit of straight flat track and a train that can spend some time plugged in. But it's a pretty good idea. We've carried over 100,000 passengers in that time and we haven't missed a service. Pull down the description for more information about this train and about the Byron Bay Railway Company. For most railroad companies, it'll be a better idea to add a third rail or some overhead power lines and run the train off the regular power grid. But with solar power, and as a demonstration of what's possible with solar, and your train, your train's a neat way to bring some tourists to your town."
266,The one-lane bridge shared by cars and trains," Dunedin Railways started operating in the 1990s and we run a tourist train business. We cart about 80-90,000 passengers a year. The route is 154km return from Dunedin and follows a river gorge up through the Taieri River up onto the Strath Taieri plain. The scenery is spectacular, how they built it. They started in 1879, it was completed in 1891, all by hand. It's really up and down. Just to be clear, this isn't a tram, or a trolley bus, or light rail, this is an actual train running on the street here. There used to be a lot more in the country. It was a cheap option, why build two bridges when you can build one? They were mainly built in less populated areas because trains and cars don't usually combine very well(!) so you wouldn't build them in the cities. But the cars just have to follow the road rules. Rarely you come across a car anyway. The train is going at a speed that it can stop pretty easily, and usually the cars have to back up. We've never had a problem on a road-rail bridge. Level crossings are worse. Technically, I guess this is just a very strangely shaped level crossing? And there are a few other bridges like this around the world."
267,The circle visible from space,"Mount Taranaki is a stratovolcano on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Before humans arrived in New Zealand, about 700 years ago, most of the country looked something like this: dense forest. Māori settlers cleared some of it after they landed here, but European settlers, a few centuries later, they cleared forest on an industrial scale. In 1900, that area became a National Park, defined as a circle six miles in radius from the summit of the mountain. Farmers, of course, cleared everything up to that circle, as far as they could legally go, and the result was this wonderful view out the window as you fly from Auckland to Wellington. But at some point, that flight's going to become a bit more difficult, as is living around here. Under that rock, there's still magma ready to go: Taranki is active, just quiet right now, and it's overdue. One study said there's an 80% chance of some sort of eruption in the next fifty years. If it's the big one, the government's civil defence evacuation plans describe the entire National Park as an area where people ""are unlikely to survive"". And it could shut down air traffic over most of New Zealander's north."
268,The Hundred-Tonne Robots That Help Keep New Zealand Running,"New Zealand's ports are vital to keeping the country running. The Ports of Auckland are testing 100-tonne autonomous robots. The A-STRADs can stack containers with an accuracy of a couple of centimetres. They weigh 70 tonnes before they even pick up a container. They are automating while still operating the terminal. It's an absolutely crazy thing to do but we have to do it because of our space limitations. The first one is the simplest, which is a big fence around the terminal to keep people out. Beyond that, we've got a computer system that monitors where all the machines are all the time. And then as last layer of defence, the A- STRADs are all sort of defence-safe. They're all automated and fail-safe, so it's both manned and automated. And that's never been done in this way anywhere else in the world in the way that it's done in New Zealand or anywhere else else on the planet. And so we can get a lot more capacity out of our same piece of land. So we're now getting robots which can work much more steadily and stack higher and stack closer together. So that enables us to then move the container stacks just a little bit and that spreads the wear and tear on the pavement over a much longer period of time. The Locata system is our system for the positioning of the machines."
269,The sculpture that looks like a real-life cartoon,"The private art collection at Gibbs Farm in New Zealand opens up to the public once or twice a month. The tickets are free, but they go very quickly. The most famous piece in the collection is this: Horizons, by Neil Dawson. Fifteen metres wide, they height of a four-storey building. Depending on who you ask, it either resembles a piece of corrugated iron blown in from a distant farm... or a giant paper tissue that's been thrown away. It's made of welded steel, and I think the thing that sells the optical illusion best is that little spike, that little incomplete fold. Which is, yeah, actually a big spike of metal, but from a distance, your brain just doesn't see that. But if you actually want to stand here and experience that optical illusion for yourself, if the feeling of being here, in person, is important to you... well, you'll have to join the rest of  in the queue for tickets. It was commissioned: Alan Gibbs, who owns this farm and the art on it, is one of the wealthiest folks to come from New Zealand. And rather than collect art that had already been made, he hired internationally famous artists and sculptors and said, in short: here's some money."
270,The Last Play-For-Cash Fascination Parlor,"Fascination Parlor on Nantasket Beach, near Boston, is the last play-for-cash arcade in the world. There are 64 machines here, so on a busy night here we'll have 64 players. Each time you sink a ball, the corresponding light on the board switches on. First to get a line of five, horizontal, vertical or diagonal, wins, or in some cases, first to light up the whole board. And here, you win cash. It is a game of skill. Like everything in life, there is some luck that goes into it, but certainly there are some skilled players that I have witnessed over the past year. ""It is still running on century-old technology, ""just a few different components are changed in and out, of course. ""They are all tied together into one circuit and work amongst themselves. ""I think there's a place for it to expand and grow ""and be in a lot of different places throughout the world ""but the reason it isn't everywhere is, I think, ""we are a part of the technological era, ""and with different ways that you can stay busy nowadays, ""there are other things that pull away from old-fashioned fun, if will."" It's going to continue to build off of that Fascination."
271,The broken building that must not be destroyed,"St Peter's Seminary was built in the 1960s to be a training school for priests. It was put on the list of historic Scottish buildings in category A, which means that it's of national or international importance. But, by the time it was listed, it had already been closed for years. The Archdiocese of Glasgow has been responsible for it since the moment it opened. It is now a ruin. It's covered in graffiti, it's inaccessible and it's dangerous. Despite the fact that this is a one-of-a-kind religious building, it isn't apparently a place for kids to picnic in the grounds. Parents would probably pay an admission fee to bring their kids to the grounds in the summer. But apparently it would be abhorrent, and apparently it's not even a place to have a picnic in. That's the reality. That is both the reality and the dream. And so there's something tragic about it, there'sSomething haunting about it. This is something for anyone who wants to come forward with plans, with ideas, but at the same time realistically, the state, the nation would probably say ""what a mess"". Those people that understand that buildings would have an understanding, and that that brutalist, brutalist architecture would see it as an extraordinary treasure."
272,The canyon that humans made by accident,"Providence Canyon, a couple of hours' drive from Atlanta, is known as Georgia's Little Grand Canyon. The ground here is made of unconsolidated sediment deposited tens of millions of years ago on what was then the sea floor. At the start of the 19th century, this whole area was flat forest, none of these canyons were here. The park management has to move these fences occasionally; sometimes they'll find that one of the spires out there has just fallen after heavy rain. There are strict no-climbing warnings here, because, well, the rock you're holding onto could just fall away and dissolve in your hand. So my question is: should this count as a natural wonder? It is part of nature. People do come to wonder at it. All those colors are from the different minerals that are in the soil. But exposing them: that was very much human. [rumbling noise] So I'm hoping the microphone picked up that noise. Er, because as soon as I turned my camera off, there was a massive noise, and I'm fairly sure that was a rockfall. From this cliff. Which is worrying. It's probably fine. It'm probably fine, though. But it's probably not."
273,The city of golf carts,"Vanessa Fleisch is the mayor of Peachtree City, Georgia. The city has over 100 miles of golf cart paths. It costs the city $1.8 million a year to maintain the paths. Some of the carts have heaters inside them and radios. Some kids can drive their carts to school with their learner's permit. It's a bit of freedom that they enjoy, says Fleisch. But sometimes they can be removed and they go faster than they should, which isn't good, she says. ""I would have removed the limiter on it. I would have done exactly what I'd have done at age 15 with my own golf cart,"" Fleisch says of her experience in a golf cart drive-thru. ""It's very quiet... See what I mean? Death wish, good grief! Along here, this is Lake Peachree-Sorry, I got distracted by ducks. The Founder, Mr. Cowan and his cousin were the ones that put up the dam and spillway that made this lake originally that went over 100,000 gallons a second"" ""People do do this towards this city, which is pretty affluent, which I guess is one of the reasons the golf cart path work, but there are a lot of cities in America that that haven't worked out why it's worked here and why it hasn't elsewhere"""
274,An American Stonehenge: The Mysterious Georgia Guidestones,"The Georgia Guidestones were put up in 1980 by modern people with modern equipment. Inscribed on them in eight languages are what seem to be rules for a future post-apocalyptic civilisation. The person or people who paid for these stones stayed anonymous, so no-one knows if they were actually intending to troll conspiracy theorists. Maybe someday we will know the real reasons behind these stones. But until then there's a rule of thumb called Occam's Razor. The simplest solution tends to be the correct one. And a rich person who saw Stonehenge and thought ""I want one of those"" is a pretty simple solution. ♪ [a faint recording of the US Marine Band playing ""Nearer, My God, To Thee""] ♪ The Georgia Guidestone video is available to watch now on YouTube, or click here to watch it in its entirety. The video is also available to listen to on the BBC iPlayer, or on the iTunes App Store, or the Google Play Store.

275,Testing the world's longest echo,"Inchindown is an old oil storage facility in Inverness, in Scotland. When it was in use by the Royal Navy all this colossal space would have been filled with fuel oil. With these oil tanks, the Navy accidentally created the greatest reverberation chamber in the world. Flat surfaces enclosed by solid rock, and a chamber big enough that sound takes a whole second or more to go off the far wall and bounce back. As it gets quieter we will turn up the level on the microphone so it's easier for you to hear. Thanks to the Bannerman Group for letting us into the tunnels, to Allan, Alan and Preston for helping with everything here, to Matt Gray who is behind the camera and who's had some musical experiences over on his channel. Go for it. Aagh! That is terrifying. Right, everyone ready? We're going to shut up for a bit. So now I'm going to fire a starting pistol, a very, very loud bang. On the screen is a visual display of that sound. Different frequencies will reverberate for different amounts of time so you will see that and hear that. And as it gets quiet, we'll turn it up to the highest level so that you can hear it too. Go on."
276,"I hit 3,000-year-old art with a hammer","The Uffington White Horse was carved into a hill in Oxfordshire before the British isles had written history. We have no idea who made it, or why, and until humanity invented aircraft millennia later, no one could even really see it properly. Oxford University, back in the 1990s, came out with a newly developed sensor which was able to determine the last time sunlight touched the bottom of the trenches on which the Horse is founded. And that put it to what we know today, 3,000 years ago. This is by far the oldest chalk figure in the country, nothing else comes anywhere near it. We're smashing the chalk into the figure of the Horse today to preserve its appearance and keep its longevity as people have done for the last 3,.000 years, otherwise it wouldn't be here. It is a very real connection with the folks who came before us. Smashed it!...nothing, just nothing. It would grass over over 25, 30 years, and be lost forever. Without that human intervention, it would grass and die. But we want to keep it looking its best as long as we can. Repair and upkeep that's been going on for millennia. Through Roman empire, the medieval period, invasions, the English Civil War, the formation of the United Kingdom; all the way up to the Information Age."
277,Testing the sound mirrors that protected Britain,"In 1929, a 200-foot wall of concrete was constructed on Romney Marsh on the south-east coast of England. Sound waves from the bass of a plane engine have a wavelength that is much longer than the whole surface of those dishes. When conditions were right, they would pick up the low hum of an aircraft engine 27 miles out to sea. That signal would become the twitch of a needle on a gauge in a control room behind that wall. The mirror's focal point is different depending on the direction of the incoming plane, so the operators could work out the direction. of approach based on which microphone was picking up the sound. But then humanity invented radar and building 200-ft walls of concrete became obsolete very, very quickly. So this was never used in wartime, but it does still work. There's not much technology that, er, [drone buzzes] that can survive 90 years of decay, but when your technology is a massive lump of concrete, I guess that's a little bit easier. I'm talking about the history of radar over on the RAF Starrship channel, everything that replaced this. Thank you very much to all the team from that, who helped make this happen. I'll see you on the other side of the sea."
278,Watching for nuclear attack in the Arctic,"If the Cold War had ever become Hot, the bombs would have been going straight over here. This is Tuktoyaktuk, on the Arctic Ocean, in the Canadian Northwest Territories. The DEW Line was built in the 1950s: 57 radar bases ranging all the way from the Aleutian Islands to Greenland. All the bases were completed in just two and a half years, and North America was prepared for Soviet attack, at the cost of around half a billion dollars from the two governments. Half of these stations were shut down a few years later. The rest of the Line, including this station here, well, they played a role in air defense. But they weren't the shield that North America hoped that they would be. Now, this site is part of the North Warning System, part of a modern radar defence around the whole continent that can detect basically anything inbound at any altitude. Which is why I'm not allowed near it. Governments on this side of the pole want to be sure: the Cold war might be over, but just in case, they'd better keep watching. And for all that, the DeW Line lasted about five years until it was obsolete. But it kept running, at least until the 90s, when a more modern system was constructed."
279,The new highway to the Arctic Ocean,"Inuvik, a small town of about 3,000 people in the Northwest Territories, is about 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Until recently, this was the end of the Dempster Highway, about as far north as you could get by Canada's road system. In 2017, after years of difficult construction over the permafrost, an all-weather highway finally opened, from here to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic Ocean. It's now springtime. The thaw is beginning and large sections of the highway, particularly in the south, have pretty much turned to mud. So for safety, the government has closed the road, at least for now, but sooner or later, the road will be fixed and the highway will reopen and TukToyakTuk will be connected again, says CBC's John D. MacIntosh. ""This highway is just going to be one more change in a century of them,"" he says. ""The future of the Canadian Arctic is unknown right now. Climate change means that thepermafrost is melting. Sea level rise is already threatening this town. This is not some abandoned Arctic outpost. There's cell phone service here,"" he adds. ""It's just very far north"""
280,"Making 200,000 tons of arsenic dust safe","In the 20th century, more than 200,000 tonnes of gold were extracted from the rock underneath the Giant Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada. That mining also created more than 100,000 tons of toxic arsenic trioxide dust. The mine closed in 2004, and the mining company went bankrupt. The government is now trying to freeze the arsenic in the chambers to keep it from getting out into the environment. The project could be as early as summer, 2021, but more optimistically, it could be in the next few years, when the chambers are frozen when the remediation phase is complete. It will cost 934 million, including the cost of the care and maintenance that we'll go into right now, and then the long-term maintenance and care and care. Thanks to the Giant Remediation Project, everyone can't just walk away from their mining legacies today and make sure that today's mining companies can't walk away with their legacies from today's regulations. It's the right thing to do. These days, countries in the developed world have regulations that mean that mining companies shouldn't be able to do this. We have environmental studies and long- term plans, and we have public scrutiny of everything we have done. There is no half-life here. It won't decay over time. The dust will be just as deadly in 10,000, 100,00 or a million years."
281,The town that was burned for science,"The St. Lawrence Burns was a project to study how fires develop in buildings. The researchers burned a total of eight buildings, including six single-family dwelling homes, one two-story school, and one community hall. They got a lot of different data, including things like carbon monoxide concentration, smoke density, rise of temperature, oxygen levels. Aultsville has almost passed out of living memory today. But you could see there's a little bit of it in every modern home, in everything that's been built in the developed world from the 1960s onwards, because the results from the St Lawrence Burns here really did change the way that everything was built. It's not all science and infrastructure like here, but it is a great little channel. And you'll want to go and check out her video about the ISO-standard exit sign. It is a little? Yeah, that's fine! It's pretty little! The results were probably worth it. But it's also tough to ignore the human element. Many people weren't even told about the burns. Others chose not to watch. The volunteer fire chief said in an interview years later that watching the flames was ""devastating"". But the results wereprobably worth it, and it saved lives. It helped change the national building code of Canada."
282,The US-Canada border splits this road down the middle,"The official line is that this is Canada and that's the USA, but both countries' maps show the road as being entirely in the US just here. The houses are definitely in separate countries but the road is not quite as clear. Even on that side of the road, I am considered to be still in Canada, as long as I don't stop and walk up to an American house. It's fair to say that there's a little bit of leniency here, if you're just nudging the border by a few centimetres. But as for this specific road? There are local stories about drunk surveyors and pranks, but no one really knows. But while I was setting up my camera here, the police turned up, lights flashing, to move along those bikers you saw earlier who were admiring the view from the other side. It all seemed in good spirits, but they had crossed the border. Well, the library is part on the Canadian side and part on. American side. But you stay on the sidewalk, and you go through the front door and it's permitted. But back years ago, it was tolerated that people on the American side could cross over. And now today, well, it's not tolerated no more. I think the rule hasn't changed much. But they're more enforced."
283,A Town Called Asbestos,"Asbestos is a mineral, easily mined in pits like this. It can be turned into strong, cheap, fire-resistant insulation. It was used in a huge number of building projects in the 20th century. In 2006, the town's then-mayor tried to change it, but the idea was voted down. All the time, people turn up here, to document The Town with The Name. Some just set up a camera by the mine overlook, turn up for a couple of hours and film something. Others don't even visit, they just make fun of them from the other side of the world. ""A Town Called Asbestos"" by Jessica van Horssen is a definitive history of the town and the mine, based on it and thoroughly researched. Maybe the name will change, if only to stop jerks like me coming along and looking at this place. It's only been a few years since the mine closed in 2012, and it's only a few decades since it's been mined. Asbestos, and this mine, was defended by the folks who worked here. In '97, four men from this town, four of the luckier ones, ran the Paris Marathon. And they were congratulated in Canada's Parliament for showing that the risks weren't that great."
284,The US president has a bulletproof railcar,"The Ferdinand Magellan, officially known as U.S. Car Number 1, is 120 tonnes of armor-plated, bulletproof rail car. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first sitting President to fly in an airplane, back in 1943. President Truman toured America in this train, campaigning for re-election, travelling tens of thousands of miles between tiny stations known as whistle-stops, and making up to eight speeches a day. When the Ferdinand Magellans fell out of use, it's now a piece of museum furniture, but it's still used by the President to give speeches. It was never painted red, white, and blue like Air Force One. When they had to park it somewhere, they would hide it with other Pullman rail cars, so it was basically hiding in plain sight. After Roosevelt's death, President Truman used the Magellan for a while, asking the engineers to get the train up to 80mph, if they could. Of course, air travel became easier and safer and cheaper and eventually theFerdinand Magellan fell from use, but the museum still uses it for special events, such as when the President gives a speech from the back of the car. It's still open to the public today, and it's on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History."
285,There's a mermaid show in Florida,"Weeki Wachee is a natural spring in Florida, but it's also a tourist attraction. For more than 70 years, there's been a mermaid show here. The state of Florida bought the attraction in 2008 in an effort to save it. The last audition call for mermaids here made the news around the world, and the articles are sounding a lot more positive than they did 15 years ago. The longest we hold our breath here is the Ferris wheel. That's when we hold each other and we spin around. The water is 74.2° year-round. There's so many different species of wildlife that inhabit a Florida river, we get 'em all. Turtles, otters, the manatees are always a favourite. The turtles love to get in the way, and they'll follow your tail around. Every once in a while, blue moon, sometimes we'll get alligators. If they're in a range that's too close, we will get out of the water. We do do a lot of Make-A-Wish programmes. Just making such a difference in their lives, just by coming to work, we're pretty lucky that do that. Thanks to the team at Weeki Wachese State Park, you can find out more about them at the links in the description."
286,This city centre has no street names,"In the centre of a large city like Mannheim, only a few major streets have names. Google and Microsoft get confused and give each road multiple names. Apple insist that each road just has one name, and they're entirely wrong. OpenStreetMap, which is community-led, recognises full addresses but not the individual blocks, although presumably that'll be fixed within a few hours of this video being uploaded. This city has been around for centuries. Why change it just because some programmers can't figure out how to put it into their database? The programmers have only been around a few years. The address of a place here in the Quadrates really is just a number, then a block, Mannheim,. Germany. Even if some computers don't believe it. While the numbering patterns have changed over the years, this bit of Mannheim has had some form of block numbering for a long, long time. This isn't something brought on by future-looking city planners rebuilding after the Second World War, or 80s planners getting ahead of themselves. It's not a modern invention, either. This is a centuries-old tradition, and it's been used for a very, very long time, even if some computer systems don't know what to do with it."
287,Remote controlling an entire airport,"London City Airport is building a new control tower to replace the 30-year-old one. But that new tower won't have any people in it. It'll just be a tall mast with a lot of cameras. The people will be 80 miles away. We're in at the London City ops room,  which will go live in January 2020. And this is where London City air traffic control will be provided from. Given the augmented reality overlays and the extra height, the extra tower might be more safe than the old tower. But it still feels a bit a bit governed by something that can't be governed by solid evidence. Here is the evidence that something so far outside your everyday experience is important, so important that it should be governed. Bad relationships, walking down a dark street at night; avoiding things that might hurt you. Bad decisions. Bad weather. Bad things that can be a good reason to avoid something that feels wrong. Bad people. Bad situations. Bad roads. Bad buildings. Bad traffic. Bad skies. Bad conditions. Bad airports. Bad road conditions. And bad weather. Good things to do at night when it's dark. Bad places to go at night, bad roads at night. Bad parking. Bad hotels. Bad restaurants. Bad bars."
288,The German town that's literally cracking apart,"Government tried to bore for geothermic energy in Staufen, south-west Germany. Ground is expanding, bulging up, and forming cracks in almost every single house. It took two weeks for the first cracks to appear. The company settled out of court for more than €1m, but the cost of the damage here is estimated at more than 50 times that. There are eight other German towns with similar problems, and they are all in the process of being fixed. The town hall was built in 1546, and it has risen more than half a metre and moved sideways by about the same amount since the drilling operation began in the 1970s. The swelling started with about a centimetre per month, now it's down to about a millimetres per month. But it's still swelling, and even a millimeters per month is still way too much for every house in the town of 5,000 people. Theoretically, they can stop it, but you cannot just plug it like a bathtub. It's not a single plane, so in reality you would need a big, big plug and you don't even know where it exactly is. And while the industry and the country have learned from those mistakes, for this town that knowledge comes a little too late."
289,The Lava Lamps That Help Keep The Internet Secure,"All modern encryption, including that padlock up in your browser, relies on big, properly random numbers. If you can somehow predict those numbers, you can start breaking those locks. Cloudflare was one of the first companies to provide free SSL encryption for websites. We videotape these lava lamps and take the pictures and video, and turn it into a stream of random, unpredictable bytes. This data is then fed into our data centres and then fed to the Linux kernel which then uses it to help seed random number generators that are used to generate keys. Whether anything in the world is truly random is arguably a question of philosophy and not science. Maybe everything is just complicated clockwork, maybe everything is really random, and we're just trying to make it seem like it is, but it's not really that easy. We also collect randomness around the world. So in our London office, we have this thing called a chaotic pendulum. It has three pieces and it's unpredictable in which way they twist and turn together. In our Singapore office,we have a radioactive source that we use to feed into the randomness system, as well. So this is not just some stunt that we pulled, it's actually beingfed into our real systems. These folks aren't the first to do this. ""Lavarand"" was patented by a company called Silicon Graphics in 1996, but that only lasted a couple of years."
290,The Story of Salvation Mountain,"Leonard Knight spent 28 years building Salvation Mountain in the California desert. The mountain is covered in half a million gallons of latex paint. Knight never thought of himself as an artist, he just did what he was doing. He wasn't inspired by anyone else's work, unless you count God. He just created this, and it resonated with the world. The moment I knew about it, I wanted to come here and see it for myself. I started volunteering here because I realised how important it was to everybody that came here. I've met people from little countries in Africa, to all over Europe, to floating little islands and this and that. And some people, they come here for the religional deals on it, cool. Some people come here just for pretty people takin' pretty pictures at a pretty place, which-be respectful, and that's cool too. It's getting you out, you're doing stuff. They're getting off their couches and getting away from the TVs and stuff, which is... TV is awesome too, though, so I'm not knocking TV. The biggest thing is about love is God, and relationship with Jesus. Like these people all just love cruising around and hanging out. That's all awesome. We don't think about all the dumb crap in this world."
291,Why California's musical road sounds terrible,"The musical road of Lancaster, California, was a publicity stunt for a car company. It was supposed to sound like this: [William Tell Overture, by Rossini] but instead, it sounds like this. The problem was probably the English language. Whoever did the calculations said that the grooves should be so far apart. And they meant there should be a groove every four inches. But whoever gave the instructions to the work crew said that they should be ""four inches apart"". And that was interpreted as four inches between the end of one groove and the start of the next one. That error means that every note is distorted not by a fraction of its value, like if you're travelling at the wrong speed, but by a constant amount. The higher the note, the greater the effect of that distortion. And the really strange part? This is the second musical road built in Lancaster. The first one, built by the car company, was too close to residents, who complained about the constant noise. And probably this note here. So the city paved over it and rebuilt it... to the exact, same, wrong blueprints. That's a take. Right there. And in order to celebrate that take, I am going to put my foot down. This is an SUV. It doesn't, er... it doesn't do that."
292,Reaction ferries are really clever,"Four ferries cross the river Rhine in Basel, Switzerland. The ferries have no paddles, no oars, no engines, nothing on board to power them. Instead, the captain angles the boat against the current, and uses the force of the river itself to push the boat across. Boats like this are called reaction ferries, and there are examples all over the world. But to everyone else, it's an invention we've never thought of, says John Defterios. ""To anyone who grew up in a place with these ferries,. it's a really obvious idea, but to everyone other, it’s an Invention we'venever thought of,"" he says. ""Maybe there is still some big, obvious-in-hindsight stuff out there that'll change the world... just as soon as someone thinks of it,"" says Defterio. ""I'd like to think that I'd have worked it out eventually, but I'd probably missed the easy option to start with. But if I've missed that, then the obvious follow-up question is, well, what else have I missed? And is there anything out here that every single human has missed?"" he asks. ""What is the answer to that question?"""
293,The rotary jail had a slight problem,"In 1881 an architect called William Brown and an iron foundry owner called Benjamin Haugh patented an idea for a new type of jail. The Rotary Jail. In hindsight, it was not a good idea. It's impractical, unsafe, and massively overcomplicated. But that didn't stop them selling the idea to a few towns across the United States. And the first one was built here, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. And while it hasn't held prisoners for decades, it is the only one where the mechanism still works. We have a two story rotary jail, and there are eight cells on each floor. It weighs approximately 30 tonnes, it's made of steel. And it's operated by a hand crank, the hand crank moves both floors of the jail at exactly the same time. The advantage of having a rotational cell block was that you could have just the one opening, the inmates could enter/exit their cells from in front of a pie shaped cell block. So if you only had one door to watch, then you didn't have to pay as many guards to be here to watch the inmates. There's just one way out. The half-moon seat shapes are toilets, they've been welded shut. So when our jail was built in the 1880s our inmates had indoor plumbing and toilets inside their cells."
294,A nuclear waste dump you can walk on,"In the 1950s and 60s, there was a uranium processing factory in Weldon Spring, near St Louis, Missouri. The plant closed in 1966, as the most contaminated site in the area: PCBs, mercury, asbestos, and radioactive waste. In the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the site a Superfund Site, meaning it would finally be cleaned up. And the result is this: a seven-storey high nuclear waste dump, the permanent disposal cell, containing more than a million cubic metres of toxic waste. But this isn't a monument to how we've fixed their mistakes: it's a reminder that we're still fixing them, and that we'll still need to for centuries or millennia to come. And that was going to be pretty much all of the video. Except. Then I did a bit more research. And I found out about Coldwater Creek, a few miles away, where radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project, the project that built the first nuclear bombs, was just dumped there in the 1940s, with the government's approval. That waste eventually flowed, decades later, into people's backyards after flooding. That was in 2015. Now, the risk is apparently minor. But radiation hazards are invisible and terrifying: local residents are concerned about clusters of cancer diagnoses, about infant mortality caused by contaminated groundwater."
295,An elevator that actually goes sideways,"Multi is a full-size, working elevator that moves sideways without cheating. It uses linear induction motors. To save weight, these cabs are made of carbon fibre and aluminium. Thyssenkrupp's models say it will, but everything's been tested and approved here. The next step is to sell it. to the kind of enormous multinational companies who build skyscrapers and who do not like risk. And that might be a greater challenge than making the elevators in the first place. You can pull down the description for more about Multi more about the team at Thysseldi and Multi here.

296,The Museum of Failure,"80-90% of all innovation projects fail. Companies sweep them under the carpet and pretend they don't exist. The Museum of Failure takes these failed products, puts them on display, so that everybody can learn from them. The criteria that a product has to meet to be here is: that it was an innovation, and that It was a failure. and the failure is a deviation from expected, desired outcomes. I'd say about a third of the stuff I've bought on eBay, the other third I've gotten on specialty forums. Some of them have been donated, which is great, some of them just come by my office, and say ""I want to give you this"", you know? One of them was a Palm Pilot: I took it, but I can't put it on display because the Palm Pilot was a success. One serious concern that I do have is: when a product is overhyped, and then when it's launched, it doesn't meet those expectations, then there's a big risk of failure. So I'd be lying if I wasn't nervous that the Museum of failure would flop! It would have to be on display at its own museum, so... The Museum Of Failure is like one of these perpetual, everlasting machines. It can never fail(!)"
297,The poison garden of Alnwick,"Alnwick Garden is located in the grounds of Alnwick Castle, in the north of England. All the plants in here have the ability to kill you, so you’re not allowed to touch or smell or stand too close to them. The Duchess of Northumberland is the inspiration of the whole of this garden. When she became the Duchess, she had a vision to create a modern, contemporary garden that would educate visitors. So the Duchess then realised: I don’t want to listen to children’s gardens because they can switch off. If you can switch them off, you can have a garden that is a little bit more peaceful and a bit more tranquil. It will be open to the public from April to October.

298,The world's most powerful tidal current,"The Saltstraumen Maelstrom is the most powerful tidal current on the planet. Twice a day, the sea rises and falls by about two metres. The water level in the fjord tries to equalise. The channel starts wide and steadily narrows to the centre both ways. It's the right width, and the right shape, to create this maelstrom of whirlpools and currents. Every little twist in the tide and the water creates a new vortex and a new boil. I had to get close enough to stick my camera in on a long pole, and honestly? It terrified me. But all this force, all this water, this is just a fraction of what's being pulled around out on the ocean. But here it's visible, it's on a human scale, and it's threatening. So here we pay attention to it. And it's a perfect storm. It doesn't pull a modern, bouyant, powered boat down to the depths, although a swimmer on their own would be in a lot of trouble, and a large ship might lose control and be dashed against the rocks. But unlike the whirpools of myth and legend, thismaelstrom isn't going to pull amodern, Bouyant,. powered boat."
299,The Beer Pipeline of Bruges,"The Half Moon Brewery in Bruges, Belgium, is the oldest brewery in the city. The city centre is a World Heritage Site, so a new pipeline was needed. The beer goes through at the rate of about 5,000-6,000l/hr. It takes a batch of beer about a small hour to get to the other side of the pipeline. The pipeline runs only under public domain, so only under the streets, not under houses or private properties. It wouldn't be possible to connect a pub or even a house along the pipeline, however, that's why we invented the crowdfunding. People could crowdfund to actually get some beer for life, which was the replacement of having a little beer tap in their own house! Thank you to everyone at the Half Moon brewery in Burges. Pull down the description for more about them! The brewery is based in the Belgian city of Bruge, which is famous for its chocolate, lace and beer. The brewery has been open for around five centuries, and has been in the same place since the 16th century. It is now the only brewery left on the site, but there have been new brewers coming along with new ideas recently. There used to be 30 brewers in the town, but now there are only two."
300,Inside YouTube's Mixed Reality VR Lab,"Mixed reality is a way of letting everyone else see what it would be like if we were there too. We have an actual camera that is filming you in the headset, in front of a green screen, and then the game just needs to know where the virtual camera should be. We're using a PC that's specced-out with the highest-end Intel processor, 32 gigs of RAM, and the current high-level consumer video card, which is an NVIDIA GTX 1080. And because the tracking on the HTC Vive is so accurate, we can do things like go in for a close-up on the laser gun that I reckon I'm holding right now. And so what that gives us is four views instead of just the one. The four views are, yes, the headset view as usual, we also see the background, as seen from the perspective of this virtual camera. And then we have two layers of foreground, one of them is the image itself, everything that should appear inFront of the player. Then we have just a luma layer to help you key out the black space. The SteamVR plugin automatically selects the foreground and the background based on the position of the headset. And anything that is between the headset and the third controller is foreground and anything that's beyond the headset becomes background. Here in our studio, we're doing a live composite on the fly."
301,Elia: The World's Most Frustrating Work of Art,"Elia is a 32-metre-high dome in the middle of a windswept field in Denmark. In the middle, just between those four pillars, there is a gas burner. It shoots a massive flame eight metres in the air, a huge blast of fire. But it probably won't burst into flame at any moment, because it does that, on average, for just 25 seconds about once every two or three weeks. At random, decided by a computer. It might be months between eruptions. And according to an article in the local news, it won't go off if the wind is too high, which is probably is today, or if there are any people too close. So if Elia calls to you, if you want to see the fire in person, you're going to have to camp out and watch it, 24 hours a day, maybe for months. That doesn't stop people crowding into the Louvre in Paris to fight with selfie sticks. There is something about being there. And sure, there are a couple of photos or videos from people online who've been lucky. But you can also go online and see the Mona Lisa in much higher resolution than you ever could in person. As for me, I've got about an hour left until I have to leave to catch my flight. So here's hoping."
302,The Confusing Borders of Lake Constance,"Lake Constance is a condominium, which is a fancy way of saying that it belongs to more than one country. Switzerland is not happy with that: according to them, the border runs straight down the middle of the lake. Germany is basically like, [shrug]. No-one really has a problem with this. If there are any legal issues, they're settled on a case-by-case basis. The only people that this lack of defined border does affect are cartographers, map-makers: there is no option on most digital maps. Computers and people don't know where to draw the line. We'll sort it out when we have to, and in the meantime no-one's really going to mind. We are used to the idea that the Earth is divided up, and different countries own different bits of it. Which is kind of a strange idea when it's put like that, but since most of the world agrees on it, we stick with it. And sure, sometimes borders get complicated because of treaty glitches or land disputes, but this isn't one of those: it's just thatno-one ever bothered to actually put down in an international treaty where the borders are. If you're on the lake, you are simultaneously in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland."
303,Stopping a Disastrous Plan with Science: the Bay Model,"The US Army Corps of Engineers Bay Model is one and a half acres or more. It was used to test a plan to dam the San Francisco Bay in the 1950s. The model is 1:1000 scale horizontally and 1:100 scale vertically. It took three years for Reber's plan to be tested here and in that time Reber passed away. For his supporters, the results from the model were devastating. It looked great on paper, convinced a lot of people, but when it was tested they found that it was only good on paper. The end result was it failed on ninety-nine different accounts. In short, not only would the Reber Plan have been a disaster, it would has been a billion dollar disaster. The Bay Model would come in useful again someday. And it did, helping to test smaller and more practical schemes across the bay for decades. These days, of course, computers can do all of that for a fraction of the time and the money, but it's still a good educational resource. There shouldn't be any shame in we following bad ideas. Sometimes, and changing your mind based on new evidence and allowing others to do exactly what it's made to happen is something our world should be built on. It's a testament to something else. To science. To having hypothesis, and then admitting that it's wrong."
304,Arson as a Christmas Tradition: The Gävle Goat,"Gävle, a city in Sweden, has a Christmas tradition: build an enormous goat out of straw and put it in the town square. In the fifty years that a ten-metre-high, mostly-unprotected goat made of extremely flammable straw has been put up here, the goat has only survived twelve times. Burning this down is arson, it is completely illegal, and genuinely, the people who make the giant straw goat do not want their giant straw goats to be burned down. But every year, someone takes the risk of a fine and criminal record and time in jail to try and burn down someone else's hard work. And that strange, in-the-shadows, battle, that almost sitcom-like plot, gets the world interested, and sends a few tourists to a fairly obscure Swedish city. All it takes to create a tradition like this is the same thing happening for a few years in a row. This goat wouldn't be famous if it didn't burn down. This would just be a small local display. But it's still there. And now, it's 2016,. the goat was put up just a few days ago, and as I record this, it was still there, and it is really, really easy to burn down this goat. The goat has already been burned to the ground."
305,The World's Most Dangerous Path Isn't So Dangerous Any More,"El Caminito Del Rey, near Malaga, on the southern coast of Spain, was once the world’s most dangerous path. It was built between 1901 and 1905 by sailors and prisoners, who were either used to working at height, or didn’t really have much of a choice. The trouble was: people kept falling to their deaths, at the rate of one every couple of years. So eventually they found a solution: build a brand-new path, on top of the ruins of the old one, and build it to 21st-century standards. There are safety helmets now, there are handrails, there's wire, there is a guard at the entrance checking tickets. And there is wi-fi and toilets at each end. It works. It used to be as dangerous as, say, a base jump, it used to attract thrill seekers, the real adrenaline junkies... and now? It attracts tourists who are okay with heights. And I reckon that's better. Even if the click bait might not be true any more, a heck of a lot more people have access to what is an incredible place. And even if the old blog posts from the 2000s, you will still see the old image sharing sites and YouTube videos from five years ago saying, ""oh yeah, this is still dangerous. This is still terrifying."""
306,Pod Cars of the Past and Future: The Morgantown PRT,"In 1975, West Virginia University opened their own Personal Rapid Transit system. This really is personal transit: you push a button, and a car arrives to take you where you want to go, non-stop. At peak times, there'll be a car along every few minutes for each separate destination. Just like the pods at Heathrow decades later, this was going to be the future of travel. So why wasn't it? Well, in most cases you can do almost everything that PRT can do with regular light rail with less upfront cost and less political risk. Sure, PRT is faster and a bit more efficient, and it's a more pleasant to ride. But the rest of the world went with simpler systems, because every journey is cheaper... just with less charm. Thank you to everyone at Morgantown PRT and West Virginia Pull down the description for more information about them and about the college! It’s the spine of our transportation network. It's that little engine that could that could turn that little car into a locomotive! It's the engine that that could make that little train that could pull that little locomotive into a big locomotive. It is 1970s engineering genius. The technical manual for the system is online on WVU's web site. The system, right now, can carry over 4000 passengers an hour."
307,The Town Where Wi-Fi Is Banned: The Green Bank Telescope and the Quiet Zone,"The Green Bank Radio Telescope is the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. It was instrumental in uncovering the molten core of Mercury. One of the biggest projects the telescope does right now is also looking for living things out there in space. The telescope is sensitive enough that, if it was pointed the right way, it could pick up a signal with the equivalent energy of one snowflake hitting the ground. The US Government has put strict limits on transmissions within the Quiet Zone, about 100 miles on each side. The observatory buildings near the telescope are huge Faraday cages, keeping all the emissions inside. Once you're within a mile of the telescope, the restrictions are so severe that only diesel cars are allowed. Folks who say they're hypersensitive to electromagnetic fields move to this area: and even if the evidence says it's pretty much all pretty much fine, they still feel better for being here. The scientists, however, have more practical concerns with radio-frequency interference on site. They're monitoring the site and doing routine runs to see if there’s anything new out there that they’ll have to jump down and monitor. They’re trying to keep them from emitting lower frequency electromagnetic energy, which doesn’t very fine, doesn't distort the image too much."
308,Listening for Nuclear Tests at the Top of the World,"In 1989, 183 countries signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Two decades later, and the treaty is still not enforced, because politics. But the people who drafted the treaty thought that might happen, and created the Preparatory Commission. Their job is to get everything in place for when the treaty hopefully, eventually, comes into force - and even if it never actually happens, to try and do some good anyway. And this over here is one of the results: IS18, an infrasound listening station, part of a network that spans the planet. It’s a microbarograph: a set of very precise air pressure sensors, and it listens for very low frequency sound waves, far below the range of human hearing. They’re less like sound, and more like massive disturbances in the air that travel round the globe after enormous explosions. Even if new testing in the Arctic is unlikely, data from here can still help triangulate other explosions. When you're designing a network to keep watch on the planet, not just where most of the people live, that network really does have to be global, even if that means setting up a research base in one ofThe most remote locations on Earth. I'm here because of Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic! It's an amazing chance to be here on the top of the world, Ellesmere Island, glacier right behind us, and we're going to put on a show in Toronto."
309,The Fake-British Ghost Town In China: Thames Town,"Thames Town was one of nine Western-style towns to be built on the outskirts of Shanghai. Completed in 2006, it cost ¥5 billion to complete, and can house up to 10,000 people. Its sole purpose was to house students and staff at nine universities in nearby Songjiang University City. Once the town was completed, the majority of properties were bought up by wealthy investors and individuals looking to make businesses and this place their second home. As demand rises, prices rise, and in this case prices skyrocketed, making it unattainable for universities to provide accommodation for their students. The town now serves more as a place of tourism, and even more so, a backdrop for wedding photography. The best way to describe it, I would say, is it kind of feels like a Hollywood set. But behind closed doors it doesn’t feel so Hollywood, and you get a totally different feeling. The thought that I keep trying to shake is that this is an actual community where people actually live their lives, rather than just being a tourist attraction. It’s quite interesting to say the least, and I would I keep reminding myself that I can stay here as long as I want to. Of course you can nitpick the small things, like windows being larger in English, but this is just a preference of Chinese culture."
310,The Scientifically Inaccurate Dinosaurs That Must Stay That Way,"The first ever lifesize models of extinct creatures, built for the gardens of the enormous Crystal Palace that used to stand on top of that hill over there. They were made by the wonderfully-named Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, we now know that they are utterly wrong in many significant ways, but at the time they were a marvel: look at what once walked the earth! Now, in England, there's a list of buildings that have special protection under the law. Buildings on that list are called... Listed Buildings. Because they're on the list. Of buildings. And this country's full of them: Historic England, the not-quite-government organisation that manages the list, says there's about half a million buildings on it. Most of those are only Grade 2 listed, but more than 10,000 places are Grade 1 listed, which means they must be preserved. These dinosaurs must, by law, remain inaccurate, because the story they tell isn't about prehistoric times... it's about science, just 150 years ago. And they can't be updated to reflect what modern palaeontologists know, because that would involve changing them, and destroying not a dinosaur display - but a display about what we once thought dinosaurs looked like, something that's notable not because of what it represents in itself."
311,"The Bus Replacement Rail Service (yes, that's the right way round)","The B797 road between Leadhills and Wanlockhead is shut for resurfacing. The diversion takes about 45 minutes by road... but by luck, there happens to be a volunteer-run, narrow-gauge railway between the two. The bus replacement service was an idea that was born out of some discussions between some villagers and the volunteers on the railway. If you're watching this video on the day or so after it goes up, there may still be time to travel on this service! Details and a link are in the description, along with the dates when they're running steam trains on the track this summer. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] Thank you to everyone at the Leadh Hills and Wanlockedhead railway! If you are watching on the same day as this video, you can still travel on the service. Details and an link are also in the descriptions, and can be added to the description by clicking here. The response has been great so far this week. The villagers are enjoying it, and we've also had a few extra tourists that we wouldn't normally get on a weekday coming to see us. So it's good publicity for the line, and it helps the villagers! It works. And it's not often you'll find that a disruption to your journey can actually make your day better."
312,"The Strangest Elevator In Italy: the Ascensore Castello d'Albertis-Montegalletto, Genoa","Genoa has several funicular railways and elevators tunnelled through the rock. The strangest one of these is the Ascensore Castello d'Albertis Montegalleto. It goes vertically, right up to the castle at the top of the hill. The bit that the passengers get into can only go horizontally on its own. It attaches to a cable that pulls it along. When it reaches the lift shaft, it's actually getting into another, bigger elevator, and then it gets hoisted up and down in safety as if it were a regular passenger elevator. It's a brilliant bit of engineering. And it's all so people don't have to walk 300 metres to a regular lift. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a name here!''I say that wearing a red shirt. And I say that that's dangerous?' 'Yes, it is,' says the man in the red shirt, 'but it's a great idea in theory' 'It's the same hack that Disney use for the Tower of Terror at their theme parks' 'Yes,' he says, 'it is' 'And it's like a Star Trek turbolift, but that's not what it's doing. Because that's the solution is kind of obvious'"
313,"The Most Dangerous Stretch of Water in the World: The Strid at Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire","The River Wharfe, at Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, is the most dangerous stretch of water anywhere on Earth. Thanks to the local geology, the river basically turns on its side, gouging out passages and tunnels in the rocks below. There isn't any riverbed just below the surface, it's a deep, boiling mass of fast and deadly currents. There are even tales from the 12th century of a young boy, set to be the future king of Scotland, who died trying to jump across those waters. Anything, or anyone, that falls in might not come out in any recognisable form: it could just get pulverised against the rocks underwater over and over andover again. Is it survivable? Maybe, with a lot of equipment and a lotof luck. But that's also where a young child drowned back in 2010. That's why it's so dangerous. It looks safe, it looks tempting, and it'll kill you.

314,The Not-Quite-Robots That Help Fix Fusion Reactors,"The Joint European Torus reactor at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy is behind some blast doors just a few metres away. It's not really dangerous in the same way that current nuclear power plants are, but it contains toxic beryllium and low-level radioactive... stuff. This is the mockup version of the reactor, used for training. There are all sorts of cool technologies for remote presence that could be used one day. Virtual reality. Gesture recognition. 3D cameras. All of which would be great: if they work reliably, every time, and if they'll still work and be supported after 10, 20 or 30 years of use in a radioactive environment. For all those same reasons, the answer was yes... but very, very slowly. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here! Add a comment here!

315,Driving Through Russia Without A Visa: The Saatse Boot,"If you're a British tourist, Russia isn't easy to get into. You have to book your travel, then request a formal invitation from the hotel you're staying at. You can't just arrive on a plane and ask them to let you in. And you certainly can't ever, ever just drive across the border. The area behind me is the Saatse Boot, and it's about one square kilometre of Russia that juts out into Estonia. When Estonia was part of the Soviet Union, that wasn't a problem. But when the country became independent in 1991, a couple of villages on this side of the Boot were cut off. Until recently, the road over there was the only way to reach them. Now, at some point, like many of the complicated borders in the world, the Boot is going to be fixed. But diplomacy is slow, and so is government bureaucracy, and right now, it is still possible to drive through a little bit of Russia without a visa. Just very very carefully. It's actually a bit of an anticlimax. It is a really, really bad idea to mess with Russia at all, let alone on their territory, while you're filming it. The answer to all of those is: I don't know. It depends on if any border guards see it, and how they feel that day."
316,Inside A Satellite Clean Room,"Innovative Space Logistics is a spinoff from TU Delft's engineering department. They now launch Cubesats, like this one -okay, it's a model, that's why I'm allowed to touch it. Cleanrooms also have to remove microparticles, things smaller than a bacterium. The worst-case scenario is contamination on a camera lens, or a vacuum gyroscope that fails while it's doing 10,000 RPM... in space. This is a small communications satellite called Nayif-1. It will be a communication experiment and also will be used in classrooms for teaching about space. Schools can pick up the signals from this satellite decode them in the classroom and teach about space, teach about radio. It's not planned at the moment, but maybe in the future we will send something to Mars! You never know. [Translating these subtitles?

317,The Second Largest Freezer in Norway,"The Hunderfossen Bobsleigh Track is the second largest freezer in Norway. The track stays frozen in temperatures up to 20°C so athletes can speed down here and pull 4G on the final turn. There are 90 tonnes of ammonia circulating in pipes inside this freezer, underneath the track, being repeatedly compressed and then evaporated to move heat away. Ammonia is the fastest working fluid to drag away the warmth. All the ammonia is going inside 65km of pipes and it will stay inside the pipes in all conditions. If something happens, I will shut down the spots that accidentally have the leaks. It's lighter than air, so it will be going upwards so you won't be harmed! But the laws of thermodynamics always hold true. You can't create cold, you can only ever move heat. And in the process of moving it, you generate more heat. That's why the back of your fridge at home is warm, and why air conditioning units need to vent outside. And on a freezer this big? That's quite a lot of heat to move. There's a load more videos over on the Olympics channel and on my channel, go check 'em out, go subscribe, and thank you to the Youth Winter Olympic Games for bringing me out here to Lillehammer."
318,Why Wuppertal's Suspended Monorail Wasn't The Future Of Travel,"Wuppertal, Germany, has a century-old suspended monorail that still carries about 80,000 people a day. Construction on this started in the 19th century, and it's been kept up to date ever since. There's a fantastic story about it once carrying an elephant -which panicked, fell out into the river, and -amazingly -survived. Compared to other options, they generally fail on cost and reliability. You can solve exactly the same problems with light rail that doesn't always need an expensive elevated track. Or a tram, that can run along existing streets with just some rails laid down. Or you could just use the simplest option: a bus. Doesn't look as cool, though. [Translating these subtitles?

Sure, monorails Look cool, But objectively, They're apretty terrible idea"" ""Monorail"" is a term used to refer to a type of elevated train system that runs along a grade-separated track along a route. It's like something out of 'Thunderbirds' - but with rails instead of just rails. "" monorailed"" means'monorail' in German."
319,The Russian Woodpecker of Chernobyl: How To See Over The Horizon,"In the 1970s, if you wanted to see if someone was launching an intercontinental ballistic missile at your country, you had two options: put a satellite in space -which at that point was expensive, impractical, and likely to fail. You need a radar powerful enough to bounce off the ionosphere, spread out for thousands of miles, and still have enough signal to be detectable after it bounces back. Welcome to the Duga-3 Array, in Chernobyl. This was known in the west as the Russian Woodpecker. For more than a decade, it randomly hopped shortwave frequencies, trying to find the best one to get a return signal. It was so powerful that countries around the world filed official complaints with the Soviet Union, and there was a small industry of ""Woodpecker filters"" or ""Moscow mufflers"" that would notch it out on your radio. Fortunately, all that transmission power was for nothing. Because no-one ever launched, and somehow, despite everything, humanity got through the Cold War. [Translating these subtitles?

Because this isn't like pointing a radar into the air: if you're bouncing the signal, then the ground is going to reflect back just as much as the missile that's flying above it'"
320,Radioactive Bananas in Chernobyl,"Bananas are a great source of potassium, and a tiny fraction of that potassium is an unstable, radioactive isotope. Every second, a few hundred potassium atoms in this banana decay. If you just spend a night sleeping next to someone, anywhere on earth: you'll get half a banana's dose. We've got potassium in us as well, so we're all very slightly radioactive. Being here, in the city next to the world's worst nuclear accident? Three bananas an hour, rising to twenty or thirty in a few areas. That sounds like a lot, until you realise that the cosmic radiation I got on the airplane flight here was about a hundred bananas, or about a chest x-ray. The actual danger here in most parts of Pripyat and Chernobyl, is not from background radiation. It's from the vegetation that's very good at pulling radioactive particles into itself, it's from kicking up dust and breathing it in. I'm not allowed to put any of my belongings down on the ground just in case they pick up dust, and I'll be scanned for radiation when I leave, just in Case. Even now, nearly thirty years after the Chernobyl disaster, everyone in Europe is still getting about an extra 20 or thirty bananas of radiation every year."
321,Containing the Worst Nuclear Disaster in History: Chernobyl's New Confinement Structure,"In 1986, the nuclear power plant here exploded -and that is a sentence you never ever want to hear. The local area was evacuated, and it won't be safe to live in for millennia. In the months after the disaster, a concrete sacrophagus -it's called the Shelter Object -was built around the damaged reactor. It cost a lot of lives, and used a megaton of concrete and metal. But over there is its replacement, still under construction. It's the New Safe Confinement. It is enormous, a steel arch a hundred metres high. When it's done, it'll be hauled by steel cables on enormous tracks over the reactor over the course of a week. And once it's there: the sides will be filled in, and the reactor will be contained again, ready to be decommissioned safely. That's great -provided in that hundred years, we can find the money, time and technology to safely dispose of all the radioactive waste that's going to be in there. Will we do that? Or, once there's not an imminent threat of disaster, will we kick it down the road for a future generation to deal with? Or will we be spending another huge sum building its replacement?
