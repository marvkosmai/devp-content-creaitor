0,Reopening an airport terminal is harder than you might think,"The South Terminal at London's Gatwick Airport will reopen to the public after nearly two years closed. The first flight from the South Terminal is scheduled to leave on Sunday morning. The South Terminal has been open for 60-odd years, but has been closed for the best part of two years. The airport is reopening 85% of it straight away, with the rest moving over from the North Terminal over three days. It is a huge task that we're undertaking, but we're feeling really confident, actually. The scale of what we're doing here is... we've often likened it toopening a smaller airport,completely from scratch. We've got a phased plan for our airlines moving back over from North Terminal, but all the infrastructure will comeonline more or less from day one. It will be about 3am when the first passengers go through the doors. And they probably won't know that the terminal was closed. They'll just want to get to their destination, even if they don't even know their destination. It's the biggest one I've done at Gatwick airport. I've never done anything like it before. I think it's fair to say, we all thought it'd be over in two weeks' time. But it's much more difficult than you might think."
1,14 science fiction stories in under 6 minutes,"I used to make short science fictionvideos for this channel, years ago. But these days, they don't really sit right with what I do. I'm locked into being 100% factual. And the truth is: I'm not great at writing fiction. But I do still have some ideas that                I want to get out of my head. So I'm just going to roll these ideas off, one or two sentences each, and maybe add in a few images from ""stories that might have been"" The first batch are all about brain-computer connections, which is kinda like shooting fish in a barrel, really. But there are more subtle stories possible as well, like: a brain-chip update that removes features, or hides them behind a subscription paywall, or a world in which only rich people can afford superintelligence. And then there's the idea of ""influencer"" becoming a more literal word, as kids link their brainimplants to their idols in order to experience their emotions in real time. But if you want to make a full commercial film or a show out of any of these, first of all, that's ridiculous, and also you will need to option it. I am not leaving that sort of money lying on the table."
2,"After 140 years, this old technology still keeps trains safe","140 years ago, the Callander and Oban railway set up a rockfall detection system. The system is still in operation today, 140 years later. Scotland's railway is about 3,500 track-miles. The West Highland lines travel hundreds of miles along natural mountainsides. A microwave can cause a train a problem, something as big as a washing machine could lead to derailment, says the Scottish Railways Authority. The agency is spending £40 million a year on things that prevent landslides or improve the resilience of its infrastructure to extreme weather. The Scottish rail network is one of the biggest in the world, with more than 1.5 million passengers a day on Scotland's rail network. It is the busiest rail network in the UK, making it the second-busiest in Europe after the UK’s motorway network. The rail network has the highest level of safety in Europe, with no accidents reported in the last 12 months, according to the Scottish Railway Authority (SRA) The SRA says it will spend the next few years looking at ways of preventing landslides and other hazards on Scotland’S rail network, such as rockfall and boulder fall, in the event of a major earthquake or tsunami. It says the best way to keep trains safe is to stop them at the source of the hazard."
3,"The Elie Chainwalk is safe, as long as you follow the signs","The Elie Chainwalk is 500 metres long, made up of eight chains anchored into the cliff face. It was set up in the 1920s to help local fishermen get down the cliffs to their boats. It's open to the public, completely open access all year round. A local guide explains how the chains work and how to stay safe on the walk. The Chain Walk doesn't really lead anywhere important, just to a couple of beaches in the south-east of Scotland that are pretty much like every other beach around here. But it is dangerous enough that the safety signs are justified, so plan ahead and know what the weather's going to be like before you head out. The walk is not for the faint of heart, and there have been reports of people falling, perhaps because they've ignored safety signs or strayed off the path, or been trapped by the tide. The local lifeboat has had to call out the local lifeboats to rescue people who have fallen on the Chain Walk, but it's not a dangerous place to go alone, the guide says, just be aware of the tides and be prepared to walk with a guide. The chain walk was repaired about ten years ago after someone stole the chains, and every six months engineers come out to check they're still safe and intact."
4,This town forgot to be a city,"Rochester had been a city since the 13th century, when its cathedral was consecrated. By the 1970s, urban expansion had merged the string of towns along this bit of the Medway river. In 1998, when districts were merged again, Rochester was no longer on the list of cities. A few years later, the local government petitioned to extend that city status to the whole borough, calling it Rochester-upon-Medway. But the Queen issued some special paperwork called Letters Patent that said, okay, fine, Rochester, the part of Rochester for 800 years, can still be a city. But a few years ago, one party's administrative error put it down to an administrative error, and no-one seemed to notice at all...until a local historical society spotted that Rochester wasn't on the lists any more. It was back then that it was put back on the government's list. But now it's not tied to the old city boundaries any more, it's tied to a local government district instead. It's a bit of a shame that someone forgot to file some paperwork, because Rochester is now just a regular town, not a city, and it's a real shame that the Queen didn't know about it until it was too late."
5,The top secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire,"A report was written in 1969 looking at possible nuclear sites in North Yorkshire. The idea was to create artificial harbours and canals using nuclear bombs. The US and the Soviets eventually worked out that it was a bad idea. The report was declassified in the 1990s and has never been seen by the public. But it has been found in the British National Archives and is available to download for free on the BBC iPlayer.

6,The giant chainmail box that stops a house dissolving,"Charles Rennie Mackintosh's Hill House in Helensburgh, south-west Scotland, was built in 1902. The National Trust for Scotland is trying to save the house, which is slowly cracking and dissolving. The walls of the house are made of 32.4 million individual chain mail links, which surround the house in the world's largest sheet of chain mail. The house is protected from the elements by a box made of stainless steel and eight tonnes of steel, which can be melted down into something else. It takes nine months to build and costs £4,500,000 to repair and restore the house to its former glory. It has been described as ""dissolving like anipientaspirin in a glass of water"" and is a 'pilgrim's home' for visitors from all over the world who want to see it in its natural state. It is currently open to the public for the first time in more than a decade, and the National Trust is hoping to open it to the general public again in the future. It will take 15 years to dry out and repair the house and then it will be put back to use as a tourist attraction for the rest of the year, the Trust says. It was designed by Mackintosh, one of Scotland's most famous architects and designers, and is one of the most famous houses in Scotland."
7,Literally just three minutes where I talk about some rocks,"In 1788 James Hutton, who's now known as the father of modern geology, visited Siccar Point, about an houreast of Edinburgh in Scotland. He was looking for places that would help his theory that the earth was far, far older than people thought at the time. Hutton found two types of rock right next to each other that could only have been made over what we now call ""geological time"" The discovery is called an ""unconformity"" and is one of the most important geological sites in the world, says CNN's John Defterios. ""I'm not a geologist. But today I'm on the road, and my route has taken me past something that I've wanted to put my own two feet on for a long time,"" he says. ""And that's why I wanted to stop by here, and show this to more people. Because my big question is: Is there anything like this left?"" ""I think it's probable that we've got all the low hanging fruit,"" says Defterio. ""But wouldn't it be wonderful if for once, somewhere in the. world, somewhere else, we got a new discovery like this?"" ""It's unlikely there's anything like that left,"" he adds, ""but that is still sitting undiscovered"""
8,How one British laboratory protects the world's chocolate,"About 30 to 40% of the entire world's cocoa crop is lost to pests and diseases every year. Botanists send plant cuttings around the world so they can crossbreed them and see what the results are. The quarantine process lasts for two years because viruses can potentially stay latent in the plant for a long period of time. If there does end up being a worldwide cocoa shortage, it doesn't mean that the price of chocolate will rise and rise, but manufacturers would have to make sure that chocolate does not go back to being a luxury. The cocoa beans that get turned into chocolate are a really difficult crop to grow, and need specific climate conditions to grow well. The modern world needs new, harder, more pest-resistant varieties of cocoa with higher yields, says Dr. Richard Boulden, head of the International Cocoa Quarantine Center in southern England. The center is located in a country that does not grow cocoa, so there's no risk of pests or diseases from cocoa entering the country. It's also a quarantine center for bananas, potatoes, and other crops that need to be quarantined for a longer period of two years before they can be grown again, he says. The centre is based in a rural bit of southern England, but there are other quarantines in Scotland and the US."
9,"There's a £100,000 coin buried under this London building","British coins have the year that they were manufactured right on them. In 1933, the Royal Mint decided they wouldn't make any one-pence coins that year. So there are probably seven 1933 pennies. Three are in private collections. Two are in museums. One is buried under a church in Middleton, West Yorkshire. The last one is buried somewhere under the foundations of Senate House, London. It's worth around £140,000, but the price at auction these days is easily more than £100,000. I don't have any plans to make a film about it. But it is a movie waiting to happen. And while it's not exactly in the vault of a Las Vegas casino, it's a good idea to keep an eye out for it if you want to get your hands on one of these coins in the near future. I'm not saying this is definitely a plot for a British Ocean's-11 style caper, but if there are any screenwriters out there watching this, I feel like this one might be for you. I'll be back in a few minutes with the rest of the team at 9pm tonight on Channel 4's Newsnight. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Click here for more news."
10,"Ten years ago, I predicted 2022. Did I get it right?","In 2012, I told a story about the future. I don't like looking back at things I've made in the past. But in the last couple of weeks, I've some a few emails saying: ""Tom, ten years ago, you tried to predict 2022, or at least some of the technology                and online world of 2022"" I've come back to the same place that I gave that talk. I've used YouTube's tools to go back and blur the faces in the original as well, because there's a big difference between asking a friend for a headshot for this talk and giving it to a few people. And I've got a story for you. It's set in a future, not necessarily the future, but we weren't in the smartphone era yet. I'm not saying this is what will happen. But I did predict the UI was going to change a bit. And the borders of phone screens are going to get smaller. And by sheer luck, I used a black background on the phone, so you can't see if there is a notch or not at the top. And all the political guesses I made in 2012 were completely wrong, but then, when has anyone been even able to predict politics? And I was right on the mobile network speed."
11,The meters-high mountain of mannequins in the Midlands,"Lincolnshire man re-hires unwanted mannequins for £50 a time. 25,000 of the dummies turned up from all over Europe over four months. The company name is a deliberate misspelling of the word ""manna"" Mannequin mountain is a metres-high mountain of mannequin parts in the Midlands. It's a little creepy being surrounded by not-quite-human figures in every direction, particularly around Halloween, says Lenny Henry, owner of the company. He says: ""I'm like, [whimpering] I'm sort of having a freak out for the future"" 'I did something that I called the ""Awful Walk out of the middle of nowhere,"" Lenny says. 'I'll be honest with you, it's a bit creepy,' he adds, 'but I'm not afraid of it' 'I've got 10 pairs of hands to go with that, so it needs to be a really interesting one,' he says, 'because it's not just a pile of body parts.' 'I don't need any manenequins. I've got a lot of hands,' Lenny adds. 'That's what I'm here for.' 'There's a lot more to life than just being able to buy things online and throw them in the bin,' says the company's founder, 'and that's the way to go'"
12,The hidden background noise that can catch criminals,"The National Grid has recently released their data, seven years recorded right at the source. The whole grid runs at the same, slightly wobbling, almost-50 hertz, no matter where you are. A forensic team has been using this data to try and find the source of the hum. They've used a signal processing algorithm to extract the peak, and then constrain the algorithm so that it can't suddenly jump up here or there. The team never said they were certain about the timing, only that they had a very high chance of being wrong. They were. There wasn't any apparent trace of ENF around 50 hertz. So here we have the footage from Taha, an educator and sex educator, and we can see no trace of an ENF. And we can be fairly confident that this is a little bit of something we'd expect ENF to behave in a way that we'd hope it wouldn't, because it seems to be quite strong andbehaving in a ways that we wouldn't expect it to. It's a bit of a half-wayway through the recording: maybe there's something there. But it's not prohibitive. The longer recording you have, the better. It will take a while to process, but it will take them a day to process it."
13,The Thames Barrier must never fail. Here's why it doesn't.,"If the Thames Barrier were to fail when it was needed, the damage would be almost impossible to calculate. The financial cost of London flooding would be somewhere between £20 billion and £100 billion. The Thames Barrier is designed to not fail and is rotated up into place when it is needed. The barrier has three connections to the UK power grid, and it does, in fact, work. It has three modes of operation, so that if we have a problem of a technical nature, we can go to Mode 2, Mode 3 or Mode 4 and the barrier can fall back on the other side of the river to protect London. The Barrier has ten gates, each of which can be moved by one of four separate motors. It is completely independent of the national power grid and has three separate diesel generators, which couldoperate the entire thing if one of them fails. It also has three different types of pumps, which are used to control the flow of water upstream and downstream. The barriers are designed to close early in the tidal cycle and then re-open at the end of the cycle, when the tide has gone out. It can take up to a month to move each of the ten individual gates at least twice a month. The gates are rotated up and down at a rate of around one metre a day."
14,The world's most expensive object by weight,"The British Guiana one cent magenta stamp is worth $8.3 million. It is the most expensive object in the world by weight. The stamp was first discovered by a 12-year-old schoolboy in 1873. It's on display at the world's oldest stamp dealership in New York. The company is selling shares in it to raise money for conservation and light reasons. It will remain on display indefinitely in anoxygen-free conservation case. It has repeatedly set the record for most expensive, and every time it does, it adds another line to its already very long history. The video is not an endorsement, by the way, and I have no desire to buy or sell a stamp or share in a company that's selling it or raising its value in a way that will help it keep its value or raise its value. The film is produced by the team behind the BBC's The World's Most Expensive Stamps, which airs on BBC2 on Sundays at 10pm.

15,The town where holding fireworks over your head is a tradition,"Across Britain, a lot of towns and villages have all sorts of strange, old traditions for Bonfire Night. Most of those traditions involve fire, pyrotechnics, and a significant chance of personal injury to anyone taking part. This is Bridgwater, southwest England, and today, I'll be holding a terrifying amount of gunpowder directly above my head, in a big parade with a couple of hundred other people. This isn't going to be a normal video, because honestly, honestly, I'm not really sure what happens next. It's like, any of these traditional, regional things that wouldn't be allowed if you were to ask anywhere else in the world to do it now. They were roped on for generations. But rope... tends to stretch. And once I'm happy that they're all in place, I’m happy that I'm all in the right place, once I hear a horn sound. And that's the sound of a bonfire going off in the middle of the street. And it's going to sound a bit like that, once you get used to it. It’s going to feel like it’ll be going on for a long time, but it will stop. And then it will be over."
16,The tunnel where people pay to inhale radioactive gas,"Radon, or ""rad-don"" if you're German, is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. In Bad Kreuznach, Germany, people are exposed to radon deliberately for pain relief. The dose is, per one hour treatment, between 30-60,000 bequerels. All the major international authorities say it's entirely unproven and there isn't any truly safe dose of radiation. The video should have gone out weeks ago, but I just wasn't comfortable with it when I got back here to the UK. I need to make something very clear or personal or personal: historical or scientific. I've got a duty of care to the audience, and I also have a duty to the scientific and personal truth: I think radon therapy is fascinating, certainlydefinitely works, but it's not an endorsement or personal endorsement. I don't really like doing meta stuff where I talk about the process of making videos. But I can't find any other way                to give enough context                to make this video work. It's important to break the format                visually as well. I think it's important that we get the full story behind the radon treatment. I'm not sure if it's even safe to talk about this at the moment."
17,This tiny railroad across the sea has an important job,"The Hallig islands are a group of barrier islands in the Wadden Sea. They are protected by a network of sandbars and mudflats that act as a natural wave break and storm defense. People who live on the islands have their own personal trains to get to and from the mainland. The railway is still in regular use, helping to build the sea defenses in the area. The islands go mostly underwater 50 or 60 times a year, usually in winter, and the houses are up on mounds to protect them from the rising sea. But one of the problems with living on what's basically a bit of sea defense is that you're going to be the one that gets flooded. It seems strange to describe an island as something that needs to be kept healthy, but yeah, that's why the railway's here. It's a free railroad that comes with it, and tourists can ride too. But unfortunately I'm not allowed to fly a drone here because this is a wildlife reserve. It looks quirky and interesting.  But the reason behind it grotesqueis to stop these islands, and eventually the mainland, being flooded by rising seas. And to understand why they need those defenses, we need to take a look                at the bigger picture. The story here is way more interesting than that."
18,Why this &quot;falling rocks&quot; sign is more important than most,"A Swiss village has installed a radar that can detect rockfalls and close the road. The traffic lights go red, and then the radar tracks the rockfall. If the rock falls too close to the road, the traffic light switches to flashing orange. Since installation, the radar has detected five and a half thousand events. The road is still closed in the village of Brienz, Switzerland, but the traffic lights are now back to normal and the road is safe to pass. The village is safe from the big individual rockfalls, but not so much from the smaller, smaller ones that can be dangerous to drive on. The odds of a boulder actually hitting a car are small, but they're not zero. The problem is finding the balance between false positives, where the road will be closed half the time, and false negatives, where cars could get hit by boulders.

19,"An actual, real-world use for robot dogs","Energy Robotics is putting software on robots to make them smart. The company is using a robot to constantly do inspection tasks in the Alps. The robot autonomously extracts information and reacts based on the results. It sends an alarm if something is out of the norm, or collects information and puts it into a report. The robots can also be used in oil and gas, where many of our robots are actually working, so that if the robot detects someone lying on the ground, it brings the person to the ground to help. The firm is using robots on tracks or on wheels or on tracks, which we call ""Man Downector"",so that if someone fails to succeed on a trial-based test, the robot will help the person succeed on the next trial- based on whether or not the person is lying on ground at the time of the incident.

20,The highway where trucks work like electric trains,"Electric trucks are slowly starting to become a thing. The world already has a proven, tested solution for sending power to massive, fast-moving vehicles. Electric trains have pulled power from overhead wires for more than a century. The full-scale scenario for Germany would be to equip 1/3 of the German highway network. That could reduce 2/3. of the greenhouse gas emissions by heavy trucks. The rest of Europe won't be behind the curve for a while, however, with a ban on new petrol and diesel trucks by 2040 only 18 years away, according to the UK government. The UK is planning to ban new fuel-efficient trucks by the end of the decade, and to replace them with a hybrid vehicle by 2035. The ban is expected to be the biggest in the history of the world, with the UK the only country so far to have implemented the ban. The British government says the ban is likely to be lifted in the next few years, but it's not yet clear when the ban will come into force. For more information on electric trucks, visit eHighway.org.uk/electric-trucks or go to www.ehighway.co.uk for more information about electric trucks and how to get on to the network."
21,The shooting range where you fire over a busy road,"Rifle shooting is a national sport in Switzerland. Service in the military is compulsory for men, albeitthese days with the choice to take on civil service work instead. A lot of people decide to keep their firearm when they finish their military service. But they pretty much all have thorough training in how to use them. If someone wants to cause harm with a gun, this is not the way they'd do it, says the Swiss police chief, Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""I'm not sure there's anyone who's sensible enough to do the first bits of that, and unhinged enough to take the last part of it,"" he says. ""It's unlikely to happen. It's not likely to happen"" ""I think it's the best possibledemonstration of the attitude that Switzerland has to firearms safety,"" says the police chief. ""If you're shooting a rifle here, you're lying down and you cannot see the road. That just isn't a possible trajectory for a bullet that can damage anything other than the hilltop,"" he adds. ""And also, breaking the safety rules when you're surrounded by military-trained firearms enthusiasts is... not a great plan?"" says Watzak. ""What if you stand up?"" he asks. ""That's basically the same question"""
22,The world's only float-through McDonalds,"The world's only ""float-through McDonald's"" is on a canal on the Elbe River in Germany. You have to order on the smartphone app. The McBoat is open 24/7 in summer and in spring in Hamburg. The Golden Arches have a reputation for being controlled and standardised. But seeing small reinventions of that formula can be fascinating. The video is not an advert for McDonald's. It's a mixture of familiarity and novelty, says the presenter.

23,I thought the Schmid Peoplemover was impossible,"Only three of these elevators have everactually been installed. The Schmid Peoplemover has been doing exactly that for about 20 years. It locks onto a carrier device and a counterweight, with safety systems roughly equivalent to a regular elevator. The closest analogy I can come up with is that it's a bit like closing an up-and-over garage door. The alternative is to put in an underpass, or two mass-produced elevators and a footbridge between them. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's better than nothing. It solves a specific problem when there are more reliable alternatives that are just a bit morehassle-free. It's very clever, very clever. But it's not well-wanted places to install it in, not many places not wanted to take the risk to take it out of its place, and it's very expensive to install. It would be nice to have it on every train station in the world, but I don't think that's possible. It'd be nice if it were on every single train station, but that's not going to happen. It wouldn't be the end of the world. It might be nice, though, if there were a way to make it more affordable."
24,The world's most useful model railway,"Darmstadt, Germany, is home to the world's most powerful model railway. It's one of the oldest systems on the Deutsche Bahn network. Signalmen are trained to use levers and pulleys manually to control trains. The railway has a fictional layout, 1.2 kilometres long, but it's actually 1,000 metres wide. It is also equipped with a 'route locking' system, which locks points into place when a train is at a certain point in the track. The German railway network is one of Europe's biggest and most complex. It has a network of more than 2,000 stations. It was built in 1936, and has been used by the German railway system since. It also has a number of'safety interlock' systems, which lock the points in place when they are at the right position. The system is called P2, which stands for 'precautionary route locking' It's a physical lock, not a computer-based interlock, and can be used to stop trains going too far or too fast. It can also be used as a training tool to teach people how to drive a train, or to deal with problems with the railway's signal system, such as power outages or signalling problems. It costs around £1.5 million a year to run the system."
25,The public toll road with no speed limit,"The Nürburgring Nordschleife is the longest permanent racetrack in the world. There is no speed limit on most of the track, because Germany has no national speed limit. The track is unforgiving, with sections where you will get what roller coaster fans would call air time. There are lots of safety rules, but racing on the Ring on days like this is not allowed. If you crash on a British road, the local insurance company will send out a bill that will go to your local highways company, not to the German ginsurance company. But if you are conscious, you will be delivered a bill, but it turns out that's also very good in the UK, as well as in the U.S. and other countries around the world, such as Australia and New Zealand, for any damage caused by a crash on the track.

26,Three strange river crossings,"The Hulmes Ferry takes people over the Manchester Ship Canal. The Thelwall Ferry takes cyclists and walkers across the River Mersey. The Peel Group owns the canal and the land around it. The canal was built during the Industrial Revolution, but it's now more than a century old. The ferry is still running, despite the canal being closed due to low water levels. The company is called Peel Group, and the canal is owned by the Peel Group. It's an enormous property investment, with what seems like every major bit of land in the area reached out to them. But they've turned me down for interviews, so I have to rely on secondary sources, such as articles and quotes from secondary sources. And if I'm honest, I'm relying on those quotes and articles... I only found out I was travelling out to Manchester yesterday morning! I don't like doing that, but from the look of some of those articles, they're absolutely within their rights to do that. I'm not an expert, but I'll be honest, those water levels looked fine to me, but he's not the expert. I'll get back to why that happened later. I've got a bit of spare time, and I visited three river crossings, and all of them have something in common."
27,Why this observatory fires lasers at satellites,"If satellites are in a high enough orbit, well away from the atmosphere, they can predict their position. But there aren't any landmarks in orbit for them to refer to. So Earth has to look up in the sky and work out the position precisely. One of those somethings is hidden away in the countryside of southern England. It listens for signals from constellations of satellites in orbit. And by triangulating all those signals, using a lot of maths, it works out where you are and shows you a little dot on a map. But if they're all relying on each other, that could steadily drift apart from reality. It's not strictly true that the earth, the ground we're standing on, doesn't move. But it does look significantly better after dark. And that's what lets you work in day and night. The team at the Space Geodesy Facility at the University of Cambridge have been working on this for a few years. They hope to have a more even distribution of data from southern hemisphere to northern hemisphere by the end of the decade. But they're not there yet, so we'll have to wait and see. It could be a long time before we know the full extent of the effects of climate change on the Earth."
28,I took the world's shortest flight. It was underwhelming.,"The Orkney Islands are a 22,000-strong archipelago. The vast majority of their population lives on what's known as the ""mainland"" Only about 4,000 people live on the outer islands. Air service to Westray and Papa Westray is subsidized through the UK's public service obligation scheme. The world's shortest commercial flight runs from Westray to the next island, a mile away. The route costs £17 or £18 per person, depending on the number of people on the flight. It is the world's only commercial flight to the Orkneys, and takes 80 or so seconds to take off and land on the island of Kirkwall, the largest town in the archipelagos. It's also the longest commercial flight in the world, with a route length of 1.7 miles (2.7 km) and a landing time of 80-or-so seconds. The flight is operated by a private company called Loganair, which is based in Glasgow, Scotland, and flies from Heathrow Airport in the UK to Glasgow. It has a fleet of nine planes that can carry up to 20,000 passengers at a time. The flights are operated on a ""milk-k run"" basis, meaning they are not available on a free market basis."
29,The Islands With Too Much Power,"The Orkney Islands have so much renewable energy from wind and waves and tides that it's genuinely a problem. Power grid engineers have to make sure that the power being generated is always close to the power that's being used. There isn't a battery in the world big enough to deal with the daily peaks and troughs of national demand. We don't need to burn coal anymore. We need to be in a position where we've got a better way to get power from these islands. The Scottish government needs to approve plans for a new interconnector that could carry enough power for all the turbines that Orney could generate. It could cost up to a quarter of a billion pounds, but it could be done in the next few years. It would be the most of the highlands of Scotland could most ofthe highlands in the north east of Scotland. It's a very exciting time for Scottish renewable energy, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the Orkneys and the rest of the Scottish mainland. I'm very excited about the future of renewable energy in the UK. I think it's going to be very exciting and exciting to see how it develops in the years to come. I hope you'll join me for the next episode of The Power Project."
30,"I helped cover a 5,000-year-old monument with worn-out tires","The Ness of Brodgar is one of the most important Archeological sites in Western Europe. It is a huge Neolithiccomplex discovered in 2002 by geophysics. A team of volunteers are putting 500 old tires on top of that to protect the site. The old tires are free, they're heavy, but they can be moved fairly easily. They're just soft enough not to cause damage when they're on topof the plastic sheeting. It means the site is still going to be there, intact, when spring comes again. It's a top priority for us to hopefully keep them there and keep them in prime condition for the next 5,000 years. The weather here can be brutal, it's nice today. But we're at the end of the Gulf Stream here, so it rarely gets too hot or too cold. But the wind is harsh and fast. And it blows in salt spray. And some of the tires will have actually been moved by the wind. But it's a bit more obvious when you know where we are: The Orkney Islands, off the northern tip of Scotland, are home to thousands of Neolithic dwellings. The site is a place of gathering, around 5000 years ago, when writing hadn't really been invented."
31,How one little boat (and me) held up miles of London traffic at Tower Bridge,"In half an hour, Tower Bridge is going to open its bascules. The bascules are the bit of the road that the road sits on down below. A sailing barge called Will                wants to pass through the bridge, so the bridge must lift. But it's going to delay thousands of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. It will cause tailbacks for miles. The bridge is a tourist attraction, but it's still a working bridge. It must legally be opened, however, to let river traffic through any hour of any day. It was laid down in law in 1885 when the bridge was commissioned, and it hasn't been changed. It's quite straightforward to get, once it actually starts moving, it's quite easy to get in and out of. If you've got a tall enough boat, you can actually call Tower Bridge to have a go at raising it. The process is very similar to what the Victorians actually put in in the early '70s, up until the early ‘70s until the steam was used up. The engineers are getting ready for the lift. They work really closely with a number of agencies, including the Port of London Authority, Transport for London, the police as well as the local boroughs. They check the electrics, because we've got high voltage electric levels in here."
32,The diving gondola: a strange elevator to the ocean floor,"The Tauchgondel is a diving gondola that goes underwater in the Baltic Sea. It opened in 2009 and is one of four similar attractions on the German coast. The novelty is being on an actual short diving expedition without needing scuba equipment or a wetsuit. The experience is a little unnerving seeing the ocean rise around you, out of your control, but it's also a bit reassuring to surface again into the sunshine. It's not crystal-clear Caribbean water on the best of days, and today all those waves are churning up the ocean bed as well. But if you were hoping that sharks or huge schools of tropical fish would swim by, you’re going to be disappointed. It’s not about the fish, it’'s about the experience. It really is a really strange thing to be able to see the ocean floor from the top of a gondolola in the middle of the day. It feels like it should be some sort of 19th-century Industrial Revolution invention. But it's actually a diving bell, with a chamber that sinks under the water and lets you look out on the oceanfloor. And with modern technology comes modern safety standards, so it's a bit of a let-down."
33,I tried to film a volcano and it was a complete disaster,"Iceland has a new volcano. It's close to the airport, and relatively easy to get to. A few hours earlier there was active, flowing, red-hot lava there. But now the volcano has stopped erupting. There will be no new lava for... maybe just the next day, or maybe it's all over. The Graph is data from the Icelandic Meterological Office's sensors. It tracks the rumblings at certain frequencies around Iceland.

35,"The UK's last aerial ropeway uses no power, moves 300 tonnes a day, and will be gone by 2036.","This is the last aerial ropeway in Britain. It's nearly a hundred years old. It needs no fuel and no electricity to run. In 15 years time, it'll be gone. It takes about half an hour for a round trip. There are about 40 buckets. It will move about 300 tonnes of shale every day with no need for petrol or electricity. All the power for thisropeway comes from gravity. The factory was designed to produce 42 million bricks annually. There was a £4.4 million investment four years ago that increased the productivity up to 50 million. It producesfrost-resistant product. The temperature we fire at and the durability of the ceramic bond means we can sell this product in all extreme weathers. There's nowhere in the UK we can't sell to with our durability ofthe product at Claughton. It is a very difficult, very old, very difficult process to replace. There used to be hundreds of these ropeways around Britain, industrial sites, industrial mines and quarries. This is the only one in the country where somebody did somebody did a computer design of a new ropway many years ago, and the design of this trele heights and weights are unbelievably good. It has to cross the road, certainly in the last 50, 60 years, but it is a possibility."
36,How many robots does it take to run a grocery store?,"Grocery packing warehouse in the south-east of London is run by robots. 2,300 robots move more than a million items every day between them. The robots are controlled by an artificial intelligence system called the 'Hive' The facility is the size of seven football fields and is custom-built to make it as efficient as possible. It is the first of its kind in the UK and is being trialled across the country. The Hive is expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, with plans to expand it to other parts of the UK in the coming years. The company is also planning to roll out a supermarket in the city of Birmingham. It will be the first time a supermarket has been built in such a large part of the country, and the first in the South East of England, in addition to a number of other cities in the north and the south west of England. It's due to open to the public later this year, but the company has no plans to use it in the long-term. It has been in the works for a few years, but is still in the early stages of development. It could be rolled out to other cities around the world, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City."

The electricity is there to provide power for the cabinet, but not for the defibrilator. It's not just about raising funds initially, it's also about ongoing costs and fundraising to make sure that this device is looked after for the entire life that it's going to be in the community.

40,The world's last turntable ferry has a really clever design,"A turntable ferry has been built on the banks of the Skye strait, in western Scotland. The ferry's cabin is at the side of the boat, so cars can drive on and off without having to reverse. There is only one of these ferries left in the world, and it was built in the 1980s when tolls were removed from Skye Bridge. The current in the strait can be up to nine knots, so the only way it works is if you build infrastructure on the riverbanks:floating pontoons and large ramps that give the cars enough room to drive up and down. But that means you need a long, long slipway, and your boat needs to be lined up straight, which can be hard to do in this narrow channel. The design of the ferry is so versatile that it would have to be rolled all the time at low tide/exceptionally low tide to work properly at all times of the day. It's only four-and-a-half-feet at the stern, so it can come alongside it in very shallow water, but it can't roll all the way forward at high tide or when the water is very shallow. It was designed to be an early design before anyone figured out how to do ferries properly."
41,The Accidental Rush for Anthrax Island,"Gruinard Island, on the west coast of Scotland, is not a tourist destination. But if you really do want to get closer, there is a way. In World War 2, this is where Britain tested its biological weapons. The island was contaminated for decades, and landing was dangerous and illegal. In the 1980s, the island was decontaminated. It was sold for £500 to the original owners, and the government cleaned-up the secret wartime-up-up secret-anthrax-contaminated island. It is now a popular holiday destination for British backpackers and holidaymakers. It has also been used as a training ground for the SAS and the Royal Marines, and as a base for the Royal Air Force and the British Army. The government has always maintained that the experiments on the island were just for defence, and that the people involved were never traced. But who knows what was said privately in private? In times of war, the laws fall silent. The history of the island has been badly told, in books, in articles, in all sorts of ways. But this video isn't about that. It's about a story that I don't think has ever been told, and it's a fairly minor detail in context. The story is about how the island came to be the way it is."
42,The Long-Forgotten History of the British Moon Spacesuit,"In the 1940s, 15 years before Kennedy said that America ""chose to go to the moon"", the British Interplanetary Society had similar plans. The BIS was set up in 1933 by a man called Phil Cleator. They wanted to say, ""Hey, we think this is possible. And we think Britain should do it."" And one of their number, Ralph Smith, drew up plans for a spacesuit. But no one ever built it, until a few years ago. The suit is made out of beta fabric and rubber, much like a modern space suit. It's not designed for hours-long space walks, but for emergency situations. It provides pressure, oxygen and protection against extreme heat, extreme cold and direct sunlight. But it's not a real spacesuit, it's just a replica of that one - the Sokol spacesuit that Tim Peake, the most recent British astronaut, used in space. It can't expand out any further, but it does give a bit of movement at the arm end of the suit, just like an Apollo suit did. It has a gap between the cape and the surface of the moon, so if he's getting cold on the surface, any heat that's out from the suit can then pull this heat in."
43,I promise this story about microwaves is interesting.,"The microwave was invented to heat hamsters humanely in 1950s laboratories. The first microwave as we'd know it today was released in the late 1960s. It was the size of a fridge and had to be actively cooled. But inside it is a magnetron that converts electricity into electromagnetic radiation. It's like blowing air over glass bottles and changing the pitch by changing the amount of water inside. It can also be used to cook food, but it's not as safe as you might think. It has been used to heat food in the past, but not since the 1970s. The technology is still in use today, but in a much safer way than it was in the 1940s and 1950s. For more information on the microwave, go to: www.microwave.org.uk/Microwave-History-and-Technique.

44,The Beach Where Lego Keeps Washing Up,"In 1997, a container ship carrying 5 million pieces of Lego was hit by a heavy storm off the coast of Cornwall. Tracey Williams has been beachcombing here for years and runs a photography project called Lego Lost at Sea. She shows off some of her collection, which includes plastic bottle caps, gun wads and a valve off a tyre. The pieces are thought to be the remains of beach bonfires, but it's not known where they came from or how they ended up on the beach. It's thought that 80% of litter dropped on the streets makes its way to the sea. But it's actually not as bad today as you might think, says Tracey. She says it's just a sort of pointless exercise, picking it up and putting it in a plastic bag, which is the best way to get rid of it. But she adds: ""There's this monster in the movies, where the characters suddenly realise that the thing that they've heard about is actually the abstract thing that is actually in the room with them. Get used to seeing this horror at this point in your life, I've just got a sort-of horror at that point in my life at the moment"" It's not just Lego, it's so many plastic things and it's all as seawater."
45,Taking The Emergency Exit From A Wind Turbine,"CNN's Tom Lister climbs a wind turbine to learn how to repair wind turbines. Lister uses a fall arrest system to prevent him from falling while working on a 50 metre turbine. He climbs up the turbine, abseils out, and uses an emergency exit at the top to get out of the turbine. The emergency descenders come in different guises but the one that's at the. top there, only train with it once every two years, Lister says, because it's always the worst case scenario where it's not possible to get it out. The turbine is capable of producing 500 kilowatts of energy, but it's used all over Europe for blade repair. It's much more dangerous to climb a ladder six foot off the ground than it is to work 50 metres up in the air in the. air, says Lister, because you've got lots of other things to fail first, before you even have to use that gear. The team are alloroughly trained for it, he says, and they'll all be able to get down the emergency descender on the descender to get Lister down on to the ground in a few minutes if it's needed. But the ladder is the most likely reason that's not likely to happen, he adds."

48,What Color Is My Hoodie?,"color is not a real thing, your brain just createscolor in your head based on the signals it receives from cells. Color perception isn't just about wavelengths, it's about comparing those wavelengths to everything around. Colour is something you have to watch out for, because colors seen on a screen are out of context, no matter the lighting in the room. The colour that comes out of  your screen should also be white. The color settings on my camera have to be adjusted to match the lighting, so only the camera, not my editing program, can change the colors on my screen. The colours of my hoodie can change from grey to blue to red, depending on the light conditions. The colors of the clouds can also change from blue to purple, depending upon the lighting conditions in the area, and even from red to yellow. And the colour of my hair is changing from black to grey, and back to black again, because I'm wearing a hoodie that's the same colour as my hair. It's all a bit of a mystery, but I'm sure you'll get the idea by the end of the show, so let's get to the point. What do you think?

49,It's like a spaceship for sharks.,"The Deep in Hull is a closed system with no input or output to the oceans whatsoever. The water inside that system or exhibit is constantly recirculating between the exhibit and the life-support system. The bacteria that live on these bio-balls are converting it through nitrite, then to nitrate, then nitrogen gas. The last step in the process is the light-support process, which breaks down light-anti-microbial cell membranes within these units within the aquarium. If these are somehow breached, the environment inside the system will also breach out of the walls of the aquarium and spray out into space. The Deep is open to the public, but it is closed to the media and the public is not allowed to enter the system. It is currently being used as a research centre by the University of Hull. It will also be used to test new ways of extracting water from the sea. It has been described as ""a spaceship for sharks"" and ""a high pressure environment for creatures"" for the first time in its history. The system is being trialled on a large scale for things like a 2.5-million-litre system.

50,The Difference Between High Explosives and Low Explosives,"""High explosives"" and ""low explosives"" are different terms for different types of explosives. Explosives are a mixture of a fuel and an oxidizer mixed together. High explosives can go off at between 6,000-9,000 metres per second, while low explosives need a shockwave to detonate properly. ""High explosives can be safer than low explosives, weirdly, because they don't need to be as hot and dangerous to start a fire,"" says the Explosives expert. ""You're actually allowed to have 50 kilos of high explosive in your car without having to put a hazard symbol up on your vehicle at all,"" he says. ""It's considered not to be that big of a problem. It's not considered to be an accident of an accident, if there's an accident around a load of high explosives, they're all going to catch fire and go up in flames"" ""If you keep the high explosives separate, as long as you're supposed to, you're not supposed to keep the low explosives around as long, as you keep them separate, you'll never have to worry about them catching fire and going up in smoke,"" he adds. ""I've never seen anything like it in my life. I've never heard of it, but I've seen a lot of them."""

A French-speaking poet could not have written something that sounds like Shakespeare. The language you speak affects the poetry and verse that you can write.

53,Why Real Explosions Don't Look Like Movie Explosions,"The film industry has a lot of tricks to make explosions look like the audience expects them to. The explosive is just a thin plastic tube with fibre winding inside it, down the very forefrontcentre, it's powdered PETNpentaethyle tetranitramine. When this stuff goes off, it will detonate along its length, about six kilometres a second. The second trick is how you film the explosion, by moving the camera back and zooming in, you make it look like it is much, much much closer to the actor. You make the explosion seem longer by shooting from multiple angles, and use all the cinematic lensand colour tricks you can to make it looks... well, cinematic. The effect is from a cloud of fuel igniting into a big, yellow flames, with lots of dirty black smoke, because it's a mixture ofkerosene, petrol, diesel, and any other muck I happen to have lying around. It's pretty powerful. But, what we're going to do for the Hollywood effect, is to reel it up, and make like little flat pads of it. That will make the whole frame filled up, while everyone's still at a safe distance. And that produces a nice, big explosive effect."
54,Why Progress Bars Don't Move Smoothly ▓▓▓░░░░░░,"A progress bar shows how long it will take to complete a task. Progress bars exist in all sorts of places all over the real world. Without a progress bar, it's impossible to tell whether a task is barely started, about to finish, or stuck in a loop it’ll never recover from. The simplest possible progress bar takes the number of things to do, and shows how many of those are done. A programmer could work out roughly how long each of those processes will take, and bias the progress bar accordingly. But each one of those steps will take different amounts of time on different machines, depending on internet speed, disk speed, and other factors. It’s basically impossible to get a smoothly smooth progress bar for something like that, so we’re going to try to make it as smooth as possible. We hope you’ve enjoyed this guide to how to use progress bars in your computers and phones. We’d like to hear from you about how you use them, and what you think they can do for you.

57,Why 18th-Century Firefighters Let Some Buildings Burn,"The Great Fire of London in 1666 burned central London to the ground for four days. After the fire, the job of fire protection in London was taken up by insurance companies. Building owners would pay a fee and the insurance company would attach a metal ""fire mark"" to the front of the building. Firefighters would only fight the fire if they saw their own company's mark, or the mark of a company they had an agreement with. In places where there aren't enough people, or there's not enough political will, for a government-funded fire service, that may still be the only option. The fire service is funded by government, through taxes, for everyone in the UK, and around the world. The service is free to call, and you don't have to worry about getting a bill for it after the fire has been put out. It's also free to use the fire service to save lives, not just property, in places where you can't call for help right away. But it's not free to get a good zoom shot of Buckingham Palace from there. The road is closed off, by the way, and all you're going to see is the traffic light. The Palace is still standing today,350 years later, but it's closed off for pedestrians."
58,"Hill Hill Hill Hill, debunked, debunked","There are lots of places in the world which have the same name twice. But Torpenhow Hill in the Lake District is the only place with four words that all mean the same thing. The name's almost certainly a modern invention. There is no Torpen how Hill marked on any official map. The only thing stopping this being ""officially being ""is that there's not enough consensus that it's even a place"" to be called TorpenHow Hill. But if you type ""Torpenhow"" into online maps...quite a few of them point you there. And the thing is: as I record this, I'll CG in a map just over there, just to make my point. That one tree in New Zealand is being destroyed by vandals and ""Trepenna"" is far enough off that I have a duty to do something about it. But I didn't ask permission to be here, but I have to care about people coming to places like this, so I'm not going to say no to it. And so now, I'm going to debunk the debunk. Because if that's true, why am I out of breath? What did I just climb? I came up here from the village, it's conservativea slow steady climb on a country road."

62,Trying To Fail A Drug Test On Purpose,"Trace Dominguez is one of the mostenthusiastic and bouncy science communicators I know. He's going to test an old myth and try to purposefullyfail a drug test on purpose. The scientific name of the poppy is papaver somniferum. It contains a milky sap that can be harvested to make opium,morphine, codeine, oxycodone, Methadone, and heroin. The seeds are usually washed and processed so that they can be safely put on muffins, cakes, and breads. But sometimes some of the residue from the sap can slip through and end up making you have quite the breakfast(!) After eating a poppy seed bagel, Trace tested positive at home at 24 hours, 36 hours, and 48 hours, but then tested negative at 48 hours. Here are the results of the tests that resulted in a false positive. The results are an approximation of what's happening, because YouTube's content policies say that I can't show you actually the urine part of the test. The video is a one-off, and Trace will be back in January with a new series of guest videos to take over this channel. The next episode will be on February 6th, at 9pm ET on Channel 4."
63,"How Weird Is My Audience? I Polled 15,408 People To Find Out","A few weeks ago, I asked my audience some odd questions, and more than 13,000 people answered. I also paid a professional polling service to ask the same questions to the public. The results are puzzling, because they do not match what the researchers expected at all. The most likely explanation, I think, is that it’s a complicated question. It requires a complicated answer, and people will get them as fast as they can get them. It's a good thing I don’t think I’ve ever made a video about cats or dogs or animals at all, because I don't think this audience would have understood it. But something about this audience makes you more likely to be a “cat person” than “infrastructure person,” and that makes me think “dog person’ is safely in the lead. I really do find it fascinating. And I can’d like to ask you to vote on whether or not you think I am a ‘dog person.’ I think that would be a great way to start a conversation. I hope you’ll join me for a cup of tea and a glass of wine in the comments section below, and let me know what you think of the video."
64,The Greatest Title Sequence I've Ever Seen,"The first episode of It'll Be Alright on the Night aired in 1977. It was the only television show dedicated to showing clips the public weren't meant to see. The show's formula was simple:compilations of cockups, presented by Denis Norden, clipboard in hand, to a live studio audience. The programme was an obvious success, but there weren't enough available outtakes to make it a regular thing. By the late '80s, the show was pulling in 17 million viewers, pulling in a third of the entire British population. The only source that I have for ratings is Wikipedia, which doesn't have any explicit reason to doubt those numbers. I can't imagine some jerk after this video claiming that I believed the fake viewing figures added years ago. But I'm assuming they're true: by the early 90s, there were only four television channels, but they were publicly-funded rivals at their own Christmas. The BBC was the main commercial network at the time, and their archives were their own private, hidden treasure trove of material. It's also a warning about how YouTube won't last forever, and it's the reason why I'm climbing this particular hill. It'll be alright on the Day1, which as far as I can tell is entirely lost to history."
65,The Never-Used Road Where The BBC Crash Cars,"Road to Nowhere is 400m of never-completed 1970s highway in Yate, south-west England. Public can't drive on the road, though: it's gated off by a railway line. The local council makes it available for filming, and the whole area is closed occasionally for television shows to shoot on. Casualty used it for one of their most expensive scenes ever, which involved a huge fake bridge, crashing vehicles and setting off an enormous tanker explosion. But it's not likely to be used for anything other than stunt drivers and dog walkers any time soon. The road is still open to the public, but it's a bit of a pain to walk on at the moment, because it's full of potholes and pothole-ridden potholders. It's not a secret, either: this is a big public common, and there are people walking their dogs here. It just never happened, and no-one ever started the project up again after the council put the whole thing on hold because of the cost of building a new railway bridge over there. The only reason it's still open is because the council didn't want to pay that much for the new bridge, so they put the project on hold. It looks more realistic that way."
66,How Many Languages Are There?,"Languages are not separate, distinct things. They evolve, split, merge, fall out of use. It's hard to say exactly where one language ends, and another begins. Ethnologue counts 7,000 languages, 50% of them likely to be extinct by the end of the 20th century. Icelandic is spoken by more than 300,000 people, but it's not supported by smartphones or tablets. If you want to participate in modern life, you need to speak another language, probably English, says Simon Tisdall, editor-in-chief of Ethnologie. He says it’s about access to culture, to the insights that can come from one language, to subtext, and to the history that can be learned from other languages, such as Chinese and Arabic. He adds: “If you’re watching this and thinking, “what would it take another language to explain in a single word,’ it doesn’t matter too much.’” Tisdal says. “I’m sure there would be advantages to one global language, while there would also be disadvantages,” he says.“I think we’ve got a lot of work to do on this.”"
67,Walking The Most Dangerous Path In Britain,"Foulness Island is nine square miles and has around 150 people who live on it. Most of the island and, importantly, the road and bridge that get you onto it are owned by the British military and they will turn you away. But despite having no business here, I am on the island, legally. And that's because I didn't use the road or bridge. I walked along a very different path to get here. The Broomway has been called the most dangerous, most deadly path in Britain. It goes back at least 600 years. It's very easy to get lost out on the Broom way, particularly in low-visibility conditions. There's no features or markers to take your bearing from, so you can get very quickly disorientated. Shell craters are also a problem because of the exploded ordnance that has gone off, so it's essentially quick sand. I only guide walks when the tide is constantly going out, so we should be coming back as the tides are turning. We are three hours after high tide. The tide is still on its way out. So, obviously, we made it. Thank you, Tom! The path's called the Brooway because back before the military built that bridge, when it was the only access onto this island, it was marked by ""brooms"" every 30 metres or so."
68,Why The Web Is Such A Mess,"Tim Berners-Lee proposed the idea of the World Wide Web back in 1989. The first versions of the web were simple. Text and images were links to other text and images. You could use forms to send information, but the whole thing was ‘stateless’ Then in 1994, a programmer called Lou Montulli came up with “cookies”. They were so useful that every other browser started to use them as well. They got built into the web standards. But now they’re being used to track people, and it’s bad for privacy. The web is a mess, and advertisers are at the heart of it. But we’ll get to that in a minute. We’ve got a lot of time to kill before we get to the end of the show, so I’m going to get back to the subject at hand: the web. Back to the page you came from, then go to the bottom of the page to read the rest of the story. Back To The page you arrived at. Back into the page, and the story you came to, now to the front. Back in the front, the story about the web is about to get even more interesting. The story about advertisers and people."
69,I Almost Learned To Fly A Jetpack,"The jet pack is a lightweight, high-tech version of the traditional jet pack. It uses five jet engines to create 144 kilos of thrust. It can be controlled by the user using a nudge switch and a tether. The jet pack has been used in events in 31 countries and is now being trialled in the UK. The company has trained over 50 clients as well as 50 people to fly the jet packs. It is hoped that the jet pack will be used in a number of events in the future, including the Olympics and Paralympic Games. The first event will take place in London in 2016. The project is being funded by the British government. The UK government has also invested in the project, but has no plans to use it in the long-term.

70,Five Things You Can't Do On British Television,"In the 50s, stage hypnosis was licensed, and television hypnosis banned. But Parliament put a law in place: pay-for television services cannot broadcast sporting events, defined by Parliament, on free-to-air television. In 2009 illusionist Derren Brown performed a stunt in which he played out a ""subliminal film"" that he claimed would make some people feel stuck to their chairs. He never claimed to be hypnotizing people, just influencing with some words and some wavy lines. But officially and legally you can't try to hypnotize people over the air in the UK. The fine for unlicensedstage hypnosis can be £1,000. The rules are complicated and it's messy, but there are all sorts of rules to try and establish some sort of level playing field while also making sure that the World Hockey Championships don't go pay-per-view while all the Ice Hockey finals are free to watch on TV. But there are some wonderful stereotypes in there:Austria: World Nordic Skiing Championships. Ireland: Ice Hockey World Championships. Finland: World Ice Hockey Championships. The final of the World Cup in Canada: Hockey World Cup final. The World Cup finals in New Zealand: Hockey. The Champions League final in Germany: The Final of the Champions League."
71,"The Pumps That Must Run Forever, Or Part Of Germany Floods","The Ruhr Valley in Germany used to be a mining region. The last deep coal mine closed at the end of 2018. But you can see the legacy of that mining in the landscape. The earth and rock that was moved out of the way to create the mine shafts. They're steadily being reclaimed. One old coal mine is now a World Heritage Site. The land is being reshaped along with the land along the river Emscher. The water is being pumped through massive underground pipes. There are around 180 pumping stations, large and small, across this valley. After a heavy storm, it will move up to 40,000 litres of water every second. But the water won't go away in 100,000 or 10,000 years. It's an eternal cost, I guess, but not technically eternal, I'm not sure how long it will take for the land to be reshaped. It will be a long time before the land is completely reshaped, though, and that's a long, long way down the road in the future. But it's worth the effort, I think, for the people who live in the RuhR Valley. It is a very special place, and it will always be a special place to me."
72,My Unlicensed Hovercraft Bar Is Technically Legal,"In England, if you want to sell alcohol to the public, you need a licence. The law about that is set down in section 173 of the Licensing Act 2003. Section 173 makes it clear that as long as you're ""on a journey"", you do not need a license. This exemption only works if the hovercraft is on a journey... back and forthacross a hovercraft racetrack. So why does this law exist? Why is there this ridiculous exemption? The whole country in England is asking: Why is this exemption granted by authorities in England, and planes and trains through the country? The answer is: Because it's legal in the UK, and it's a lot of grass in England and no straightaways and no no-one's going to get thrown out of the craft when it goes round the first corner. And it's like drifting cars. It's all about steering, ahovercraft. It is all about going fast, but it's also about learning how to steer them. And if you're looking at it, you're likely to hit it! The thing is with hovercraft, to fly them, you do lean with them,​ which makes the craft pitch and makes it turn. And you might think: ""Tom, you are just doing this for show, aren't you?"" Wrong! This is a real beer pump."

76,"How Binary Search Makes Computers Much, Much Faster","In 1876, an American librarian called Melvil Dewey published a pamphlet describing how he thought a public library should be ordered. Dewey gave each subject an index number, and then said that the shelves should be order by that number. The Dewey Decimal system became a standard. It solved a serious problem: how to sort and find information,ipientwithout having to bother the head librarian. The same principle of indexing applies to computers, and has since the early days. There are two basic ways that a computer can search: linear and binary. It is lightning-fast to search with a million cards, compared to a list that the list is in order. We don’t just have numbers on cards: we also have letters,and let’s add some colours as well. We can also add letters and colours on the list, as well as some numbers. We’ve got a whole other video about that. It's called ‘Provided’, and it’ll be shown at the bottom of the page. We hope you’re interested in watching it. It will be on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday.

77,The Tiny Monorails That Once Carried James Bond,"The Roadmachines Mono-Rail was invented in a small town just outside London in the 1940s. It was intended for construction sites, in competition with dump trucks and tractors. The track is made of prefab parts, so it could be set up just by clamping bits together like a giant toy train set. By 1966, there were 800 of these monorails in the UK, and they were sold to 60 other countries. They were in use until at least the 1990s, but enthusiasts keep a few of them running. The last of the Mono-Rails came off the production line in 1977, but they are still used in parts of the UK. The monorail is at the Amberley Museum in southern England. It's not a regular attraction this time of year, but the museum has run it specially for me today. It is one of dozens in a lovely collection, including one at Nmawr in north Wales that's been modified to allow passenger rides. David Derry, who wrote the definitive book on thesemonorails, has taken to the Voice to give his verdict on them: ""They're a bad idea, but there are better solutions to these problems"" The full interview will be broadcast on BBC2 at 9pm on Monday, November 14."
78,Would You Swim In Power Plant Wastewater?,"Iceland has a huge supply of hot water, which can be used to heat homes and power plants. The country is also rich in natural hot springs, which are often used to generate electricity. But the water can also be contaminated by coal ash, which is used to make electricity. The water is not drinkable, but it can be turned into hot water to heat houses and power stations in the city of Reykjavík.

79,"1,204,986 Votes Decided: What Is The Best Thing?","The question: ""What is the best thing?"" has been asked many times before. But there is no meaningful answer to that question, so how do you answer it? The answer is a lot more complicated than you might think.

80,"Swimming Between Two Continents, Debunked","The Bridge Between Continents claims to be the point where the two continental plates are breaking apart. The cracks, this and Silfra, aren't connected to each other, and not to the countless other cracks like them across Iceland. The crack is a crack in the earth, and it is between two tectonic plates. It's where one of the cracks happened to breach an underground river. The water has been been filtered for decades through rock. There's aconstant current pushing any impurities out into the nearby lake. The bridge is symbolic, but it's also true for kilometres of this whole area, for kilometres. And if there's one theme through my videos, it's that there's not one real world that's been the real theme through the real world, that's not the real story. The real story is that we're living in a post-apocalyptic world, and we're going to find out how to get back to the real one. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.""Every word I said there was technically true. I don't want this video to take away from the magic: I'd recommend it."" ""It's about 100km southwest of there, and I'm about to debunk something, because it might make you angry"""
81,"Which Is &quot;Bouba&quot;, and Which Is &quot;Kiki&quot;?","Linguistics shows that there are associations between sounds and symbols in the real world. In a study, English speakers were able to match words for birds and fish in a language from Peru better than chance. There is a type of ""crossmodal correspondence"" or ""sound symbolism"" between sounds we make, traits like shape, texture, size, or even taste. But it’s not always easy to prove, and we need to be skeptical about some of the results. We’ll be back next week with the next episode of The Daily Show at 9pm on BBC One and 11pm on Channel 4.

82,Is The Most Northern Part Of Iceland Still There?,"The Arctic Circle is the line above which you get midnight sun at least one day a year. But despite its reputation for being cold and northern, Iceland is not above the Arctic Circle. There is one part of a tiny island called Grímsey, north of Akureyri, which is where I am now. A small, uninhabitable bit of rock called Kolbeinsey is 60km further north. It is subject to rapid wave erosion, and is expected to disappear around 2020. But it might not seem like that matters, because countries' territorial limits and exclusive fishing areas can be decided by rocks like that. We are flying out, right now, to the co-ordinates of where Kol beinsey might be. But I'm pretty sure that it's up ahead, and there's only one way to see if it's still there, and that's up to an man, who's only used to 700m by 100m by the waves, that's about 150m above the tide. If there was ever a chance to see it, this is it: I think I can see it! That man, there's a British person, and he's the only person I know who could see it. If you want to find out more, visit CNN.com/Iceland."
83,The Part Of Britain That Rises And Falls Twice A Day,"Newlyn Datum is the zero point from which all heights in Britain are measured. On some days, Cornwall might only move up and down by three or four centimetres compared to its average position. At the most extreme high and low tide, the whole area can move as much as six or seven centimetre. The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon are what's causing the ocean to move, and the tides to synchronise more or less in their timescale. Around the coast of Western Europe, Western Greenland, and through the Fundy Bay of Fundy, there are gigatons of water moving out there twice a day. The reason it doesn't start causing big things like earthquakes is because these movements add up to something very small, relative to the size of the world. It's just a little bit like a glass of juice, but if you have it around the edges at the right speed, you can build up quite a big slosh of the glass. The world's major oceans are the places where the tidalloading is larger, and that's why it's so important to keep an eye on the sea level in the UK and the rest of Europe. It could also be the reason why earthquakes are so frequent in the South Pacific."
84,Why You Should Turn On Two Factor Authentication,"In 1981, the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, was shot by a gunman in Washington DC. In the chaos, the Biscuit went missing. A small plastic card, sealed inside an opaque case, contained the secret codes that would identify the President over the phone if he gave the order to fire a nuclear weapon. The card was eventually found, but some reports say it had been hastily stuffed in the President’s shoe when the trauma team cut away his clothes. The gold standard for checking identity is multi-factor authentication, which includes a password, a fingerprint and face recognition. But using one factor isn’t ideal, signatures can be forged and passwords can be leaked or intercepted by someone hacking into the server they’re stored on, or putting a keylogger on your computer, or just by someone looking over your shoulder while you type. It might be worth checking your credit card transactions on the other side of the globe, but I’d say that if you are going to say that you are ‘something’ that gets rolled into something you are, “something else’ is better than ‘nothing’. It’ll take a while to get used to it, but it will get better."
85,"For 21 Years, No-One In Britain Knew How Long An Inch Was","The international standard for length is the meter, based on unchanging physical constants. But before metric, Britain had physical standards for imperial units, too, dating back centuries. In 1825, the yard, three feet, 36 inches, was defined as being the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar stored in Paris. But nine years after that law was passed, Parliament burned down in a fire that destroyed all the old standards. So the new standard was reconstructed on copies of all the copies that had been made over the years. But it wasn't accurate enough, and the government had to put a dodgy experiment into the law into which all the new units had been put. The result was the'standard Yard' in London, where the old imperial standard had been built. The new standard is 25.4 millimetres, which is the same as the length of a human hair. But the old standard was much shorter, and had to be re-calibrated every time a new tape measure was bought. The UK and U.S. are the only countries that still have to calibrate tape measure equipment, but they're doing it at the expense of other equipment in the UK and the U.K. It's an expensive process, but it's worth it."
86,The Village That The Luftwaffe Bombed By Mistake,"The Linby Trail, near the little village of Linby, Nottinghamshire, in England. During World War II, the Luftwaffe bombed Linby Docks, but they missed. The story is part of the local folklore and stories told from child to youth. The only people who know for sure are over 90 years old, and no one should bother trying to disprove them or prove one bit of local folklore. The trail is now open to the public for the first time since the Blitz, and it's a great place for a walk and a talk with local people. It's also a good place to learn more about the history of the village and the area around it, and to meet local people who have lived through the Blitz and have been affected by it. It is also a great way to meet people from all over the world, who are fascinated by the story of Britain during the Second World War, and the people who lived through it as well as the people involved in the bombing of the docks in the 1940s and 1950s. The trails are now open for the public to walk and talk, and there's a cafe and a pub on the other side of the trail, but it's not open to visitors. The village is now a popular tourist destination, but there's no sign of the Blitz."
87,"A Million Dollars vs A Billion Dollars, Visualized: A Road Trip","This is a United States one-dollar bill. It's just over a tenth of a millimetre thick. If you had a million of them, how tall would that stack be? It'd be about the length of a US football field or a UK football pitch. To understand the difference between a million and a billion dollars, you need something one-dimensional. You need distance. So, I am gonna drive the length. of one billion dollars.

88,The Abandoned Hill With Two Members Of Parliament,"Old Sarum in Wiltshire is one of the most important historical sites in Southern England. A castle was built for William the Conqueror and a cathedral was built in the 11th century. But the once-busy town fell from grace and no one lived there anymore. But for some reason, the landowners of Old Sarum were invited to send two MPs to Parliament in the 14th century - but why they were invited is a bit of a mystery. The reason for this is still a mystery, but it could be down to the fact that the hillfort was built on lower ground, closer to the new city of Salisbury. It's also possible that there was more than one Iron Age hillfort in the area, and that it may have been used for other purposes. It could also have been the site of an early Roman settlement, or even an early settlement of the Iron Age period, as well as the remains of an Iron Age castle, which are still visible on the site today. It is a very, very bad place to build a cathedral on a windswept hilltop in the middle of a stormy, wet and windy area. But it's a good place for a church, and the clergy moved a couple of miles away to a new cathedral."
89,Why You Can Spot Bad Green Screen,"This video is sponsored by CuriosityStream and my own Nebula Original series. I’ve been using a green-screen for my recent computer-science videos. I don’t like using green-screens, I think there’s no substitute for filming in a real physical location. But I haven't had much choice lately. I was really lucky here, I remember how the camera was set up for this original background footage in the museum. It was four or five metres away, with the camera positioned just above my eyeline. But a lot of that is down to some good planning, and some good camera skills. More on that later. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.

90,"I Asked 64,182 People About “Jingle Bells, Batman Smells”. Here's What I Found Out.","I asked 64,000 people about the children's rhyme ""Jingle Bells, Batman Smells"" There are multiple completing versions, including the one that actor Robert Goulet sang on the Simpsons in December 1993. According to various pop histories, the song was around for decades before the Simpsons. It probably started in California in the 60s, inspired by the Adam West Batman TV series. It was spread by military kids moving around America and the world with their families. It's not clear if the song is still as popular today as it was in the 70s and 80s, when it was a hit on the radio and TV. It has become a popular children's song in the UK and the U.S., but it's not as popular in Europe. It is still popular in Australia and Canada, but not as much as it used to be in the 80s and 90s. The song has been made into a film and a TV series, and a number of children's books. It even has its own TV show, ""Batman Smells"", which is based on the song, and has been turned into a children's TV series and a movie, ""Robin"", with the same name as the TV show. It also has a successful music video series, called ""Robin, The Movie"""
91,The World's First Internet Bench,"In August 2001, the mayor of Bury St Edmunds in south-east England unveiled the world's first Internet Bench. It was a bench with sockets you couldplug your computer's modem into, and dial up to the internet over a phone line. The bench just had a few phone socketswired into the exchange at Microsoft's expense. But it didn't take long before some local tech-savvy teenagers worked out there wasn't any block on the numbers you could call from here. This was all a publicity stunt for MSN, the Microsoft Network. They're probably still happy with this video, even as I tell you it was a terrible half-assed idea. Because what it did, and what it's still doing, is get their name and logo in front of an audience. They just want to be noticed. That's one of the dirty secrets of public relations. The truth is malleable. It doesn't matter if it gets ripped apart later, as long as it doesn't kill or maim anyone, then you've got your free advertising. And we've seen this time after time afterTime after time. I've done this past time in the past, and it's not even the same location, that's not the same. It's a silly project."
92,How England's Oldest Road Was Nearly Lost Forever,"The Icknield Way is one of Britain's oldest still-surviving paths. It stretches more than 100 miles across southeast England. Landowners do not get a say in who walks along those paths and it's a criminal offence to block them. England has until January 1st, 2026to find and log all its footpaths. But with five years to go, the Ramblers charity decided to try and solve the problem. They asked thousands of people to check one bit of the map each. They were shown that square on the current OS map, square on a couple of historic maps from about 120 years ago, then we basically got people to draw on the difference. It's a very complex process, but we think we've found tens of thousands of miles of lost rights of way. They can only really be appreciated on the basis of historical evidence, and that's not going to be going through your farm and finding out that there's a right-of-way through your land off their farm. It will take a long time to get all the paths back on the map, but it's worth the effort, we think. We've got a long way to go before we get to the end of this project. But we're not there yet."
93,The Worst Typo I Ever Made,"The undo command was invented by Xerox PARC programmers in the 1970s. It is an easy-to-reach shortcut of Ctrl-Z or redo. The undo command is used in Apple computers to help users back up their data. It's also an easy model for mental models of the state of a computer. The first time I made a typo, I was working on a live database. With a single instruction, I could change every record in the live database, every single page, at once. I didn't know what had happened yet, but I knew something had gone wrong. It was that stomach-dropping,reath-stopping moment when all you can do is say “oh, no’’. It’s called the clbuttic mistake, where someone wants to censor the word “ass” and the search-and-replace gets a little bit more enthusiastic than they thought it would. It happened to me when I was converting an old web site to a new and faster platform. I was maybe 18 or 19, and I was the only one working on the site, so I was just using the command line. It ended up being the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life."
94,Ə: The Most Common Vowel in English,"English spelling is really hard to learn. The character ‘schwa’ is so important to English that it has its own name: “Schwa”. This letter can also sound like the /ə/ in “about” and that sound is the one we’re interested in here. The vowel that requires the least effort is the vowel you use when you’ve got to make a sound but don’t know what to say. It’s the A in ‘about’, but it's also the E in ’petition’ and the last I in � ‘definite’. Every vowel in English, A, E, and P, are capable of being reduced to schwa, but not always. Sometimes, vowels like ‘Vowel’ are reduced so much that they entirely disappear, like “coc’late’ cam’ra’ or “sep’rate’cam’r’l’ “Nite’nite” is the same as ‘finite,’ but it has the same root. “Finite” has a different root, ‘vowel,” so it gets reduced to ‘Schwa.’"
95,Why Some &quot;Remastered&quot; Music Videos Look Awful,"In 2019, a load of music videos that had been uploaded to YouTube were remastered. Wham!'s Last Christmas is now in 4K, and it looks spectacular. Freddie Mercury's Living On My Own, the remaster looks stunning. But the old '80s digital effects have to be recreated with modern tech, and they're not a perfect match. The remastering option doesn't involve recreating the whole edit from scratch: you can take the final TV edit from the best, cleanest, professional-gradevideotape you can find, and upscale that to HD. It won't be as sharp as the original film, but it will be sharp as people are used to. This video is sponsored by CuriosityStream and my own Nebula original series.

96,Are There Problems That Computers Can't Solve?,"In the early twentieth century, a mathematician named David Hilbert posed a series of problems that mathematics should be able to answer. Alan Turing was fascinated by the idea of automating that process. He came up with a hypotheticalcalculating machine, named after him. A Turing Machine would be made of, first: a tape. Then a read-write head, which can move left or right over that tape, reading what’s there or changing it. Then it has a table of instructions, which in modern terms are the code for a computer. The machine reaches the end of its tape and it halts. It was basically an endless loop, basically it was basically a machine that could never be used to solve a real-world problem. It is still possible to write programs that will never halt, but it is very difficult to do so in a computer that can’t be programmed to work out how to do it. It would be brilliant to be. able to analyse code, any code, and say definitively: “yes"", eventually it’ll halt or. “no” But that is mathematically impossible, and we found that out from before electronic computers were even invented. We’ve all had that moment where something we’re working on freezes. And you have that horrible moment of trying to remember whether you saved recently or not."
97,The Hidden Rules of Conversation,"Paul Grice was a philosopher of language and wrote a paper in '75 called ""Logic and Conversation"" He developed a set of guidelines that explain how we communicate with each other. These are not prescriptive, you-must-do-this rules: they’re just guidelines. We all try to fit what other people say into the context of what’s happening or what has already been said. The Cooperative Principle is one of Grice's most famous maxims. The Maxim of Quality: tell the truth, the Maxim of Relation: be relevant and clear in what you say, and the Maxims of Manner: give as much information as required, and no more. We communicate far more than just the literal meaning of our words. We assume that we are cooperatingwith each other when we are talking, and that this is implied by our language. If you assume I’m trying to follow the Cooperative Principle, you can automatically work out a lot more, including the whole ""being stranded"" problem, which, by the way, was also implied by the graphics in the video game “I’'m out of petrol”. We can’t just use the super-literal, super-logical, unambiguous meaning of those sentences. We need context."
98,Why This British Crossroads Was So Dangerous,"Two cyclists have died in the last ten years in near-identical crashes. Both times, a driver failed to stop and hit a cyclist who had right-of-way. The junction is at the worst possible angle. The best solution is to stagger the crossing, to curve the two side roads so they meet the main road at the right angles, forcing drivers to slow down. But it's legal to have street lighting, which would mean laying miles of electrical cable at enormous expense. The cheapest and easiest way to solve it, of course, is for drivers to stop at the road sign, but again, the conservation area is famed for its dark skies. The local council has made some changes, but they're clearly not working, because people are still getting hurt. It's estimated at around £100,000, and locals estimate the budget for conservation is around £ 100,000. The council has not responded to our requests for comment, but we are happy to make clear that we have no plans to change the road at this time.

99,Why You Can't Name A File CON In Windows,"In MS-DOS, Microsoft’s version of DOS, all those little words are the names of “device files”. They were a quick and clever way of letting programs on a computer interface with other stuff: printers, keyboards, basically anything you can plug in. Instead of every program having to understand how to talk to every possible device, that job was given to a “ device driver’ The system won’t let you call a file “Con” in Windows 10, or an image “con.jpg” on the command line. The reason for that goes back to the old white-text-on-a-black-screen command-lines that were just how computers worked back in the 80s. But if you tried to save it to a file called LPT1, the system would be sent to the parallel port and nothing about how the port was plugged in, even knowing how to plug in a parallel port or even where you plugged in your computer. And if you wanted a really, really basic way of using those device files, you could do it with the command-line itself: “dir’d get a listingon screen ofwhatever files in the current directory or folder.”"
100,Abso-b████y-lutely: Expletive Infixation,"There are some words that I can’tuse in this video. “Bloody” used to be a taboo word. But these days, it’s been classified as “generally of little concern” by the UK’S broadcasting regulator, so I’m going to assume I can get away with it. But before we get to that part of the bloody video, we have to talk about something that high school English class probably didn't teach you: “expletive infixation” “Expletive” also has another meaning for non-linguists: a curse word, to add emphasis, which is fan-f… -bloody-tastic. But modern English does not have infixes, so you can just use any word, or even an expletive, that can be used at any point in a sentence, as an infix. The words that were wonderfully described as ‘fornic’ and ‘pre-catives’ were described as being “soab-lutely short’ or ‘so-frickin’. ‘Fricking’ means “f***ing”, “goddamn’” means ‘to ask god to damn’, or “to ask someone to damn someone’"
101,"This Video Has 52,039,859 Views","The title of this video won’t be exactly right. It only updates every few minutes at most. If you’re automating a job like that, there are two main approaches you could take. You could write something that pretends to be a human. Or you could write code that spams people, or signs them up for new accounts. But that’s not too tricky to do: “screen-scrapers” have been built to do that for decades. This is the story of how I made that changing title work, and how all this ties in to the White Cliffs of Doverand the end of the universe. It was first popular when it became ""Web 2.0"", now more than a buzzword that is more than 15 years old. It's called the ""Apache programming interface"" (API) and it lets web services interact safely with each other through code. It can be used to add subtitles to videos quickly and automatically, for example, or to tweet when a new video goes up, or ask your voice assistant to search for a playlist. But it can also change a video title, or send a single request to YouTube: ‘here’S the video ID, here’�s the stuff to change, and I can prove that I’m allowed to.’"
102,Why Dark Video Is A Terrible Blocky Mess,"In most modern digital video, there is a grand total of about 16.7 million possible colours. That number comes from how your screen works. For a modern screen, you need eight bits for each pixel, so you've got 256 shades each of red, green, and blue. But at full resolution, this video is 1,920 pixels wide, and there are only 256 shades of green. Even if you use every single shade of pure green that's possible on this format, you're still going to have a colour band every seven or eight pixels. If we take a bright gradient behind me and massively increase the contrast, you can see the absolute difference between two bands is still invisible. But if you have enough colours, even if you don't have enough,you can't even break up the colour band.Going from 1 to 202feels like a tiny change, but it's going to 202 to 202, going from 1, 201 to 2 is going to 1, 202 to 2, and so on. It's the same reason that this chart looks a lot closer than this chart. There are three reasons for it. The first is that there aren't enough colours. And the second reason is how human eyes see colour banding all over this video."

104,Inside The Billion-Euro Nuclear Reactor That Was Never Switched On,"Austria built three nuclear reactors along the Danube River in the 1970s. The decision to build the first one was controversial. The nuclear power plant is now a tourist attraction and a training centre for nuclear engineers. It's the only one of the three reactors not to be decommissioned by the end of the year. The other two are still in operation. The third one is being used as a training facility for nuclear scientists. It was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but was never used for nuclear power. It is now being used to train nuclear engineers for a new nuclear power station. It has a museum, which is open to the public, and offers guided tours of the site. It also has a radio telescope, which can be used to record the sound of a nuclear explosion. The last nuclear reactor to go out of operation was in the 1980s, and it is still being used for training nuclear engineers today. It will also be used in the future to test new nuclear reactors, and to test them for safety. The first nuclear reactor went out of service in the 1990s, after it was damaged by an earthquake. The second one went out in the mid-2000s and is now in a storage facility in the Czech Republic. There are plans to build a third nuclear reactor, but it's not ready."
105,Why You Can't Buy Dasani Water in Britain,"In 1992, British sitcom 'Only Fools and Horses' made fun of bottled water. In 2004, Coca-Cola launched Dasani, a bottled water brand in the UK. The story of why it failed here is one of the greatest marketing disasters in history. But the story is a little more complicated than a lot of the world thought, says Simon Tisdall, the author of the book ""Coca-Cola: The Marketing Disaster That Saved My Life"" The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99, with p&p from £15.99.

106,Stopping A Laser Beam In Mid-Air,"Lasers travel at the speed of light, but this effect is created using a rolling shutter on a camera. The trick is to turn the camera 90 degrees on its side, so that the laser is being turned on and off at the same time. It takes just a fraction of a second for it to go from the top, all the way to the bottom of the camera, registering each line one at a time.

107,The Country Where All Public Transit Is Free,"From Sunday, March 1st, all public transit in the entire country will be free. A ticket valid for a full day on every bus, tram, and train in the country is €4. The whole transit network costs the government €700 million a year to operate. But all the tickets sold add up to just 10% of that. London's transit network is about half-funded by fares. The main motivating factor is comfort, reliability, and safety, says David Walliams. He says it's a good idea to get people out of cars and into buses and trains. But he says it will be hard to make it work, and cities will have to invest more into public transport if they want to compete with the world's best cities for people. The country's population growth is the highest in the European Union, he says. The infrastructure system is under a lot of strain, and it's not easy to make public transport work. It's not a new idea, but Luxembourg is the first country to abolish fares entirely, says Mr WalliamS. It is also a problem for the country's economy itself, as it is a small, rich tax haven. The government says it can afford to do it because it can't afford to pay for it."
108,"The Sentences Computers Can't Understand, But Humans Can","The Winograd Schema is a test designed to stretch computer language processing to its limit. It is designed to be unambiguous for humans, to the point where we wouldn’t even have to think about it. A team of researchers at the computer sciencedepartment of New York University have assembled a list of 150 of them, as a test. A new version of GPT-2, which is the leading machine-learning system, is set to be released in the coming months. The system will be called GPT 2.0 and will be available on the Google Play Store and the Amazon.com App Store.

109,Why The Dutch Headwind Cycling Championships Are Difficult And Amazing,"The Oosterscheldekering, the largest part of the Dutch Delta Works, is a megastructure. At high speed, up to 90% of the drag on a cyclist is from air resistance. Double the wind speed, Quadruple the drag force. The difference between cycling in a 15 km/h headwind and a 120km/h gust is 64 times the added drag. The course is eight and a half kilometres, with a limit of 300 participants. It's a serious event, with permissions and everything. All the bikes are the same. There's a big rock in the middle of the barrier, with an inscription that translates as ""Here the tide is ruled by the wind, the moon and us"". It took a decade to build, and it is a rallying cry of human planning,survival and achievement. It is a good, weird human interest story, right? People are doing adeliberately difficult thing, and hurting themselves just enough that it's interesting. But it's a good place for it. Because not only are humansliterally pushing against the storm, saying, ""we can beat you"", they are on a physicalmonument to doing just that. The Dutch headwind cycling championships take place every year in Tegenwindfietsen."
110,Why TRUE + TRUE = 2: Data Types,"When you write a computer program, you use variables, or variables, which are basically just labelled buckets of memory. In JavaScript, you can just type.x = 1.5 and it’ll know, that’s a number. But in some languages, including some popular ones that people. tend to get started with, and that I like, you don’t need to actually declare that. Most languages use “explicit type declaration” and “implicit declaration’ is the most common way to use variables in computer programs. But for something that seems so technical, this can be controversial, so I’m going to try to explain it to you in a way that makes it a little bit easier to understand.

111,The Bridge That's In Two Countries At The Same Time,"The Moselle River is the international border between France and Germany. But the border between Germany and Luxembourg doesn't follow the river. It is a 'condominium' between the two countries, and they both have full control over it. If you stand on that bridge above the water, all of you is in both countries simultaneously. The border is a shape, not a line. It’s two-dimensional if you count depth. It was here that the Schengen agreement was signed, where most of the countries of the EU, including Luxembourg, opened their internal borders. But that's not strictly true. It took half an hour of research, and I can’t tell you why they made that decision, or what the legal result would be if you tried to commit a crime on the bridge or on a boat on the river, sometimes. But I mean when I say that one of the wonderful things about borders is that you can walk between three countries as easily as you can between towns or neighbourhoods. It's a lot easier to say “huh, that’�s weird” than “get on with your life’’. But it turns out this border raises a different question. Why do we even have borders in the first place?"
112,How To Grow A Martian Salad On Earth,"CNN's John Defterios tries to grow a salad in Martian soil. Martian soil contains all of the nutrientsneeded for a plant to grow. The Martian surface is covered in soil with a key ingredient of basalt, a dark, iron-rich volcanic rock. The original Martian soil simulant was created from weathered volcanic ash from near Mauna Kea in Hawaii. But this stuff, MMS, uses basalt rock found in an ancient volcano in the western Mojave Desert, which has a very similar mineral makeup to what's found on Mars. It is missing an important component of Martian soil, though, which is toxic perchlorate compounds. These could be lethal to crops on Mars, and to the humans that eat those crops. But luckily for us there are a range of different methodsariefor getting rid of them. It's really just a waiting game now, even if these things grow, they wouldn't really be keeping me full. If we're going to stay on Mars for extended periods of time, we need to generate some high-calorie food, like pea-sized plants, that will just be too heavy to bring to us with us. And we've got four varieties of micro green plants, essentially just plants that could be harvested early on."
113,How Neurosurgeons Navigate Inside The Brain,"Neurosurgery is fraught with risk. The room for error can be millimetres as we manoeuvre around bloodvessels and critical nerves and damaging any of these can cause either life changing or life ending complications. Neurosurgeons can use infrared and electromagnetic image guidance systems to show us exactly where we are in the brain during critical operations like brain tumour surgery, or inserting biopsy needles deep into the brain. The system uses special trackable instruments, such as this pointer and this stilette. The software then displays the instrument's position on either the CT or MRIscan of that patient. It can track instruments optically, electromagnetically and by creating a map between points on the patient and points in the images. It's a combination of hardware and software that uses both optical and electromagnetic technology. The technology is being trialled in the UK and the U.S. and is expected to be rolled out in other countries soon. It is not yet clear if the technology will be used in Australia.

114,Why My Teenage Code Was Terrible: Sorting Algorithms and Big O Notation,"When I was 15, I had a week of ‘work experience’ at a company. They had recently scanned in a load of photos, but they weren’t categorised. I decided to write a system to search through them. It worked fine until I got over about fifty photographs. At which point it started to get a little bit slow. And I started to spend more time trying to fix it and less time actually doing my job. To explain why my code sucked, let’s talk about Big O Notation. It's a classic of computer science. Sort, each block with a hundred operations, ten times as many times as there are blocks on it. It has to check every block in the list on every pass,and in most cases it’ll have to pass through a number of times to get it right. But it's not very efficient, but it has now been done. And that's all. And it's all, you know, a classic example of how computer science works. But now we can go again from the start:. We can compare, swap, swap if we need to. And so on, and so on. And if we get all the way to the start-to-finish-ish thing sorted, we know everything is a thing."
115,Why 2020 Started On December 30th,"As I publish this video, it is already the first day of 2020. In the ISO Week System, used for finance and business, it's already 2020. It's a perfectly valid calendar, but it can be confusing because it's so close to our regular Gregorian calendar. Back at the end of 2014, Twitter's Android app and web sitemysteriously failed for a few hours. The reason was almost certainly someone getting the two calendars mixed up. And it's one of those bugs that, even with a lot of testing, might not actually spot until something goes wrong. So, if 2019 has been a rough year for you, and you want to leave it behind:change calendars for a little while.Welcome to the twenties, 20s and 30s, 20th and 30th century, 2023 and 2030, 30th and 40th, 2028 and 2050, 2027 and 2028, 2029 and 2031, 2032 and 2029, 2031 and 2032, 2020, 2030 and 2034, 2036, 2037 and 2037, 2038, 2039, 2040, 2042, 2041, 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049, 2051, 2052, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2062, 2063, 2064, 2065, 2066, 2067, 2068, 2069, 2070, 2074, 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025, 2026,2027,2028,2029,2031,2032, 2033,2034,2036,2037,2038,2039,2040,2041,2042,2043,2044,2045,2046,2047,2048,2049,2051,2052,2053,2054,2055,2056,2057,2058,2059,2060,2061,2062,2063,2064,2065,2066,2067,2070,2071,2072,2073,2074,2075,2076,2077,2078,2079,2080,2021,2022,2023,2024,2025,2026 and2028."
116,Why Do We Move Our Hands When We Talk?,"Linguistics isn’t just the study of words or sounds: it’s also thestudy of all the parts of conversation. Gestures are important to communication, and so important that if our hands and arms are unavailable, we will use our head, our eyes, or other limbs to compensate. Gestures can also showunderstanding of social norms, or show that you’re embarrassed to say something, like covering your face, or doing the look that looks like you're not paying attention to what you're saying. They can also be used to show emphasis and to explain an abstract concept if you have a vague idea of what it is you're trying to say, or just to make it clear -- either to your partner or just your own own head, or even to your own eyes. They are also used to communicate redundancy fordecoding and encoding errors, and to show that something is not what it appears to be at the time of the gesture, but that it is in fact what it seems to be to the person making the gesture. They also help us understand the rhythm of gestures alongside the natural stress patterns of speech. They make our job easier by talking about different categories of gestures, which explain how they relate to meaning, such as Iconic, Deictic and Metaphoric."
117,Why The World's Littlest Skyscraper Was A Massive Scam,"The Newby-McMahon Building in Wichita Falls, Texas, is only four stories tall. It cost $200,000, which is about $3 million in today's money. The investors thought it was going to be 12 times as tall, but the blueprints were actually in inches. The building sat abandoned for a long time before it was renovated in the early 21st century. Today, it's a furniture boutique and the owner wants to open it up to the public. It's a great story that sends tourists to their town, but I can't tell you how much of it is true. The real story is that the building is barely usable as a building, and the investors were duped into building it in the first place because they didn't know how big it really was. It was never allowed to be entered by the public, but now it has a state-of-the-art fire suppression system. The fire marshal that comes periodically to inspect it periodically tells me that if we do ever catch on fire, we will not have to worry about burning, but we might have toorry about drowning. The story is based on an old newspaper account and some old documentation of the building's construction. It is not known if the original plans for the building still exist."
118,Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea,"Elections have some very unusual requirements. Your vote should be completely anonymous. There should be no way that anyone can find out who you voted for. No-one can bribe you or threaten you to vote a particular way. The UK’s own paper system doesn’t fulfil both of those requirements perfectly. The more physical votes you need to change, the more time and money it takes, the less likely it is that your conspiracy will stay secret. With electronic voting, the software and hardware is not the case: in the case of the voting machines, the hardware and the software are not the same. It is not possible to change a significant number of votes, enough to sway an election, very, very difficult. But once you start scaling up that attack, it becomes extremely difficult and time-consuming and the chances are going to get out of hand, says Computerphile's Richard Quest. He says electronic voting is still a bad idea, but it's getting better. It's time for a new generation of electronic voting machines to take the world by storm, he says. The time for paper voting is over, says Richard Quest, and it's time to move on to the next generation of voting machines that are more secure and more secure."
119,Can The Words You Read Change Your Behavior?,"Many Labs, a group of 186 researchers, have been trying to recreate a lot of psychological studies. They found that exposure to a stimulus, such as a word or a concept, can cause you to change your response to a completely different stimulus. The researchers followed-up on their own studies, trying to replicate their results, and they found that the priming effects did keep happening, although not always in the same exact way. ‘semantic priming’ does happen when you’re reading and listening: your brain understands what’s going on a lot faster if you hear the words and parts of speech that you expect to. The Replication Crisis is the realisation that life, and linguistic behavior, is a realisation, and that we need to change our behaviour. It's time to stop priming ourselves and start priming others, and startpriming ourselves. We need to start primering ourselves and begin priming other people, and ourselves, and the world around us, to become more aware of our own potential for priming and to be more productive and self-aware of our potential forpriming. We must prim ourselves, or we will fall victim to our own insecurities, our own self-loathing, and our own fear of failure."
120,Is The World Running Out Of Helium?,"Helium is not a renewable resource, but it is made very slowly by radioactive decay deep down in the ground. There's still approximately 80 to 100 years' worth of known helium reserves in the United States, in Wyoming. The price of helium has been fluctuating over the last decade or so, but that doesn't mean there won't be any at the end of the decade or even in the next few years. The U.S. government has the National Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, which it plans to use in the future, but only for a short period of time. The helium is notoriously known for being susceptible to escape through any small opening, and it's used as a leak detection substance in medicine, science and medicine. It's also used to keep the magnets in MRI machines cool, in manufacturing processes, and to inflateblimps and party balloons, among other uses, but there's still a lot of helium available and new helium sources being found, says Dr. Michael Bociurkiw, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. The world is running out of helium, he says, but we should treat it like a fossil fuel, because it's very, very expensive to recover from the atmosphere."
121,Why The Elevator Shaft Was Invented Before The Elevator,"The Cooper Union Foundation Building in New York City is the world's first elevator shaft. The shaft was installed in 1855, four years before the elevator was invented. It was the first time a building was constructed with a space for an elevator top to bottom. The building was renovated on the inside in 1975 and is now home to the New York School of Music and the Museum of the City of New York, among other institutions. It's the largest interior space in the city in which to hold lectures and debates, also open for free to the general public. The foundation building was designed by architect Peter Cooper, who was committed to free education for New York's working-class people. The first elevator cab that was put in this shaft was square, so it was literally a square peg in a round hole. It is a question: what should we be designing for now, and not just in buildings, but in buildings that are regular, regular and retrofit for the future?

122,I Almost Learned To Fly In The World's Only Wingsuit Tunnel,"Jarno Cordia is part of the reigning world champion wingsuit acrobatics team. He teaches skydivers how to fly in the world's only diagonal wind tunnel. Cordia flies for six and a half hours non-stop in the tunnel without touching the floor, walls or anything. He says flying in the air is a lot more precise than what you normally do outdoors. The difference between flying in air and flying in space isdefinitely the lack of space, he says. The world record for flying in a wingsuit is six-and-a-half hours, which is the most watched thing in the history of wingsuit flying. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done, but it's also the most rewarding thing, says Cordia, who has won the World Cup in Italy in both indoor skydiving and outdoor skyd diving. He is currently training to fly with a leash on the belly to let people fly free but still put them on the floor in case they do anything smart but they're not smart enough to do it in the first place. The most difficult part of flying is learning to control your body like an aeroplane from the ground to the air. It takes a lot of muscle tension to learn how to do this."
123,How The Netherlands Simulated The Sea Before Computers: The Waterloopbos,"The Maeslant Barrier is part of the Delta Works, a set of megastructures that hold back the ocean when high seas threaten to flood the Netherlands. It is one of the world's largest movable structures, with 210-meter-long gates designed to seal off the main shipping route to Rotterdam. The Water Act, part of Dutch law, establishes a maximum risk that's allowed for 10,000-year flood predictions. The Netherlands is now a national monument and nature is taking back these structures, simulating nature on a smaller scale, as we see in the Waterloopbos below the former Zuiderzee in the south of the country. It was built when the only way to simulate water on a large scale was to use water, and it's now a kind of tourist attraction, as the water flows through the flume and into the sea. The Dutch government has a plan to replace it with a new barrier, but it's not clear when that will happen, or if they will be able to afford the cost of a new one. It's a huge project, but the Dutch have a long way to go, as it's only now that they have the technology to replace the old one. They will have to wait at least 15 years for the new one to be built."
124,This Video Is Sponsored By ███ VPN,"With a VPN, all the data you send and receive goes through an encrypted tunnel. VPNs use military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. A VPN stops your internet service provider spying on what you're doing online. A good VPN doesn’t keep any logs of who’s talking to you, or where you’re sending your traffic to. And if you do use a VPN to keep any of your metadata private, all you're really doing is changing who can see that metadata, not what it is. You’ve probably seen the adverts at the end of every educational channel’S videos. Some of the claims that VPN adverts make are wrong. You can protect your computer by using a VPN. It's not special, it's just not special either. You don't have to be a professional computer security expert to understand VPNs. You just need to know how to use them, and that they're not special. They're just a way of protecting your data from people who want to steal your passwords, banking details, private data and other personal information. They don't work if you're using a web site with a padlock in the browser, or an Android app with a 'Not Secure' button on it."
125,The Giant Art That Keeps Planes Quiet,"Human hearing in a healthy, young person runs from 20,000 cycles a second, all the way down to 20. The eardrum can pick up air movements with wavelengths that range from a couple of centimetres for high frequencies, to 10 or 20 metres for really low bass. Amsterdam Schiphol airport is the busiest airport in Europe, with six runways. But there was one residential area, back there, where there was nothing but flat ground between those houses and the back end of jet engines. This is the solution: a park that serves two purposes: to be land art, and to dampen sound waves by moving enormous amounts of earth and rock in the air. The sound waves are scattered in all directions, rather than rolling over the land, instead they're scattered up and away, not onwards. The architects claim that one of the inspirations for this was people noticing that the engine noise sounded quieter when the fields were ploughed. It's not perfect, not even close, but enough to bring the noise level at those houses back down within acceptable limits. It can even filter out constant, steady noise like a fan or the wind whistling through trees. But an airport would just be a lot easier if that filtering job was a little less loud."
126,Why Helsinki's Library Robots Aren't Important,"Helsinki's new Central Library is being moved by a robot. The library has a movie theatre, 3D printers and music studios, and a kitchen. It is also using mobile robots to scan the books with RFID antennas. Helsinki's new library is the first of its kind in the world, and will be rolled out across the country. The public library is a public good and should be available to everyone, not just the rich and the clever, says Oodi's chief executive, Jussi Järvinen. The new library will be open to the public for the first time in 20 years, with plans to expand it in the future, says Jäsvinen, and it will have a virtual reality room. It will also be the first public library in Finland to use robots to shelve books, with more to come. The Helsinki library is open to all, and has plans to roll out more robots across the world in the coming years, says its CEO, Jusi J Aronson.

127,The Self-Driving Race Car,"Roborace is an organisation that specialises in autonomous racing. The DevBot 2 is designed to take a human passenger around the track. The Robocar is fully autonomous, with no room for a human. Roborace has had a few crashes, and this has been our first year of competitions. The car can also know to turn itself off. If it determines it's too far from the line it's supposed to be on, and it doesn't think it can get back there, it will shut down. It has a safe-stop system, which can turn the car off at a moment's notice from anywhere. It also uses a military grade GPS, accurate up to about two centimetres, so the car knows exactly where it is. It then chooses what speed it can go, when it needs to brake, and when to hit the throttle, based on accelerations. It's the car we use for our top speed run. We've actually had it to up to 299 kph. We use a military-grade GPS,accurate up to twocentimetre, so we can see exactly what the car is doing at all times. We have full live telemetry, which is used to monitor the car's performance. It can do a lap of Silverstone's National Circuit in just over one and a half miles."
128,"Inside The Tunnels That Will Store Nuclear Waste For 100,000 Years","Finland is building the world's first long-term storage site for high-level nuclear waste. The waste will be stored for 100,000 years in a new tunnel complex on Olkiluoto, an island in the far west of Finland. The site is encased in solid rock, and once the site is full, every bit of it will be filled in with clay. It will be used to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, which could cause disasters if it leaks. The US has been trying to work out a storage facility for years, but their one serious attempt, Yucca Mountain, has been mired in politics for decades. But Finland is closest to building that solution, and it's being built in an area that isn't prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters, as it's about as stable as you can get in a geology that's 2,000 million years old. It's not a video about whether nuclear power is good or bad, but about where to store the waste that we do have in the world, and how we're going to get rid of it in the first place.

129,What Counts As The World's Shortest River?,"This is the Roe River, a crystal-clear spring in Giant Springs State Park, Montana. It flows down 61 metres before joining the Missouri River flowing to the ocean. There have been long-documented arguments about whether it is even the shortest river in the United States. There are international claims too, like this short channel between two lakes near Jyväskylä in Finland. It is a large, natural channel flowing in one direction to a lake. It fits all the dictionary definitions, unless you want to argue that it's not large enough, but frankly if it's large enough to drown in, I think it should count. If you believe the hype, it is the shortestRiver in the world. The Guinness Book of Records did eventually agree, at least for a while. But it has sincedecided not to have a listing for shortest  river. It's not always a question that can be answered with a binary 'yes' or 'no'. There is almost always an exception to the  rule. The exact definition probably differs between languages and cultures anyway. The 'river' is whatever humans agree it is. And it really is crystal clear: while I was setting up, someone came along with some bottles and filled them up for drinking water."
130,The Toxic Pit With A $3 Admission Fee,"35,000 tourists a year visit the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana. The pit is a mile wide and so deep that you could fit the new One World Trade Center in it. It's filled with toxic dilute acid that kills any birds that land on it for too long. The site will be clean, about 7 million gallons of water will be discharged from the pit every day, and a treatment plant will be set up to treat the water. It will be the first time since 1982 that the pit has been open since the pit shut down in 1982, and water has been flowing in and out of the pit since then. The team at the pit are using a propane cannon to deter birds from landing on the pit water. They are over 99% effective, they say. The water is still flowing into the pit, and if it gets above a certain level, the nasty stuff will start to leak out. But it's a closed system, for now, because there's one more catch. There's around 10,000 miles of mine shafts and tunnels under the city of Butte. That's not an exaggeration. The rock here is full of iron pyrite, and as it rusts, you get sulfuric acid. That in turn, breaks down other metals and minerals in the rock."
131,The Only Bit Of Louisiana's Coast That Isn't Sinking,"Louisiana has lost nearly 2,000 square miles of land over the last century. The Mississippi River is filled with silt and sediment. Levees mean that instead of a wider river during floods, you get a faster river, eroding away those deposits, washing away the land that it once created. There's a large effort to rebuild the coast, and to push the Mississippi River back to the sea to create new deltas like the Wax Lake Delta, which was built in the 1940s to divert the flow of the Atchafalaya River off the Louisiana coast. It's important to restore the coast to its former glory, but it's also important to protect the land we've lost. The work is ongoing, and we'll be back next week with a look at some of the projects that are taking place in the Gulf of Mexico and on the East Coast of the U.S., including the Grand Canyon and Grand Canyon National Park.

132,"The Language Sounds That Could Exist, But Don't","The International Phonetic Alphabet was created in the late 19th century. It was designed to explain the pronunciation of words without having to talk face-to-face. The alphabet is based off the Roman alphabet, with some Greek letters thrown in. It's now used around the world by linguists, speech pathologists, and loads more people. The chart is organised based on the consonants that humans use, and includes a chart for vowels and a chart of diacritics. The sounds that are really important are where the air is pushed out of your mouth and throat, and how much constriction you make in your throat. The most common sounds to recognise are p, t, k, n, m, z, and t-t-t, which are the equivalent of the two parts of your tongue, the tip of the tongue, and the alveolar ridge, where the tip touches your tongue. The sound that is most important is the nasal line, which is all the sounds that you make through your nose, mouth and nose. It’s also important to recognise the sound of the glottal stop, which closes off the airflow in the throat. It happens in English when we say ""mountain"", ""Hawai'i"" or ""butterfly"", next down, next down."
133,I'm Not A Robot ✅,"In the late 90s the most popular search engine was AltaVista, and they had a spam problem. They needed to add a test that only humans could pass. Google releasedreCAPTCHA version 2, where you’re presented with a single check box to prove you are not a robot. When you click one of these boxes, extra data is sent to Google, which can use that data to help crack the code of the site you are trying to get into. It’s not really about clicking the box, but about what the data is that Google is trying to reveal about you, and how it is being used to help you break into the site. And maybe even a bunch of other things that Google has all learned from their machine-learning system that checks all their feeds into the Google system. It's a lot of work, but it's all worth it in the end, because you get a better idea of what Google knows about you and what it thinks you are capable of doing, and what you can do to help it do more of the time. And it's a great way to test your knowledge of the web, and your ability to use it in a variety of ways, such as how to use Google's search function."
134,Flying A Plane With Fireworks On The Wings,"Aerosparx uses pyrotechnics to create a fireworks show in mid-flight. The display can be seen from 300,000 people to a million people. Aerosparx has a computer system designed to control the LED light system on the aeroplanes. The system also controls the LED lights on the planes as well as on the ground. The company is working with the UK government to get the display approved for use in the UK and elsewhere in the world. It is not yet clear if the display will be used in the U.S. or other countries, but the company says it is looking into the possibility of using it in other countries such as the Middle East and South Africa. The team is also working on a version of the display for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. It will be the first time the Olympics has been used for a fireworks display on the Olympic Games track in Rio. The show is due to be shown on the BBC in 2016, and the BBC is hoping to use it in the 2020 Olympics in London. The event will be broadcast live from the Olympic Stadium in London, with a view of up to 1.5 million people from around the world, and on a range of other venues in Europe."
135,The Two Generals’ Problem,"The Two Generals' Problem is a classic computer science problem. It involves two armies trying to win a battle by attacking at the same time.

136,Why “No Problem” Can Seem Rude: Phatic Expressions,"“Good morning” is a greeting, not an expression of information. “How are you”, ‘How’s it going’ and “Hello” are all phrases made up of different words but mean the same thing. Phatic expressions are phrases where the semantic information is less important than the pragmatic information. They’re a way to either acknowledge another person, establish a relationship, or make sure everyone is paying attention to you. They can also be used for “backchanneling” or “listening,” which is how we express that we are actively listening to the person we are talking to. The use of phatic expressions varies from language to language, and culture to culture, which can lead to misunderstandings. They are treated equally by everyone, so look out for them! They are so ubiquitous that people are saying out-of-nowhere expressions for foreign businesspeople, and think that people who are saying them for agreement are saying it for agreement,and think that it's a sign of friendliness. They're not! They're just a way of saying hello or saying goodbye. They don't mean what you think they mean, just how you use them to say it."
137,The Fetch-Execute Cycle: What's Your Computer Actually Doing?,"Every modern computer, when you get it down to the bare metal, is doing basically the same sort of thing. But how do you go from a simple calculator to playing video games, sending stuff over the internet, or even decompressing and displaying millions of pixels in this video? In short, what’s your computer actually doing?Behind me is a scaled-up version of a computer, but we’re going to go much, much simpler. If you take apart your phone or PC, somewhere in the heart of it will a Central Processing Unit, or CPU, that makes it work. The processor has three steps:Fetch, Decode, Execute. And it will just repeat those on a loop, the one thing that’S actually built into it. So: that is our computer. Let’‘s run a simple program. All it’�s going to do is count up. And add one to it, over and over again. And then add the value at the address 7, in this case, 1 + 1 is 2. And the next time, the next bit of the memory fetches the next instruction and decodes it. And so on and so on, until the program is done."
138,How To Stop A Colossal Bridge Corroding,"When it opened in 1981, the Humber Bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. Nearly 40 years after it opened, the bridge is about a third of the way through its design lifespan, and it's time for a checkup. Water-based corrosion of steel or iron cannot occur below 40% relative humidity. Dehumidified air is pumped into the main cable and injected into a stainless steel sleeve that surrounds the cable. The dehumidification system is then repeated seven times around the circumference of the bridge. The idea that the wires are being corroded slightly could be worrying, but it's well, well within tolerances, and they're keeping a watch on them just in case. It's a continuous, 24-hour cycle, 365 days a year, that isn't elsewhere in theworld that aren't inspected, where infrastructure isn't cause little problems, like in the U.S. and other countries. It is a brutal environment for the cables. The bridge is so wide and so tall that, while both towers are vertical, they're just a couple of centimetres apart at the top because of the earth. The cables are made up of more than 14,000 individual wires, anchored into concrete foundations on the shore."
139,why typing like this is sometimes okay.,"We don't speak to everyone in our lives in the exact same way. The way we write reflects that. Our online voice can have a wide variety of ""tones"" The rise of deliberate lowercasing for stylistic effect is to blame for tone issues. There is no single way to write “There is no way to writing ‘crytyping’ ‘There’s a difference between “ok’ and “not OK’” and we don’t have to write it that way.“I’m sorry.” “How are you?”“Fine,” you say. “What do you want to say to me?""“How do I say it to you?"" “I just want to ask you a question.’""““ “You’ve got a point,’ you say, “” but you’re not saying it to me. ”.  “. ”    ""  “Do you want a cup of tea with me?’ I’ll give you a cup.‚”, she says. ‚ ""How about a glass of wine with me?"" she asks. ‘’That’d be great.‘ '"

141,The Giant Underground Tunnels Protecting Tokyo From Floods,"The city of Tokyo is built around and over rivers. As the climate breaks down,rain storms here are getting more intense. The best plan would be to pump the floodwater all the way to the ocean. But for that, you would need tunnels and buffer tanks on an almost unimaginable scale. This tank, and the kilometres of tunnels and silos that bring water to it, cost nearly a quarter of a trillion yen, or about two billion US dollars, at the end of the 20th century. It took a national recession to make this happen, but it's worth it for long-term security. It's a long way from the ocean, but the water will keep flowing for a very long time. And it's not just the water that's at risk, it's also the people living in the low-lying areas that are at risk of being flooded by the rising sea levels. The water is still draining to. the system, despite a massive rainstorm about two days ago, and there is still water in the system. It is almost impossible to convey the scale of this on camera, but you can find out more about them and their work at the link in the description in the video below. It’s also worth a visit to their website, where you can learn more about their work."
142,Why You Can't Trust Me,"Coober Pedy is a town in the Australian Outback. Half of the homes here are underground. The record high temperature here was set this summer at 47°C, 118°F. Water is expensive here: two and a half times the cost per litre compared to the big cities. But the reason for that may not be what you think. The problem isn't a desert of desert. It's a water shortage in a desert town. The story I had wasn’t about the town, it was about the bizarre landscape. It’s not a place that's friendly to humans, but we built a town here anyway. Because there was money to be made: opal mining is the main industry here. It barely rains. It is hot, dry, and it barely rains, but it's not a desert, it's a desert. The town is in the middle of the Outback, in the heart of Australia's rainforests. It could be a water crisis. But it's also a water problem in a town of desert people. It can be a problem in the outback in the centre of the country. And it's hot and dry in the north-east of Australia. It has a huge amount of rock under the surface."
143,The World's First Solar Powered Train,"The Byron Bay Railroad Company has converted a 70-year-old vintage train into the world's first solar powered train. The train has 6½ kilowatts of solar panels on the roof of the train and a 30 kilowatt array on top of the platform. The battery on the train is roughly the same size as you'd find in an electric car. The solar panels are constantly doing a trickle charge to the train's battery. This is a net carbon positive project and in the first year of service we put 60,000 kilowwatt-hours back into the grid, enough to power three houses. The company is now looking to add a third rail line or overhead power lines and run the train off the regular grid and then put some solar panels onto the train to power it. The project is funded by the Australian Solar Energy Association and the Byron Bay Railway Company. For more information on the project visit: www.solar-energy.org.au.

The machine is powered by steam but can still be made using traditional methods. It can be used to lift and move grain, grain or sand. It's a very forgiving type of machine because it can be in very poor condition and it'll work just as well if it's in good condition. It has been found that it's a more accurate volumetric feeder than a lot of the devices that are being used in the 21st century.

145,The One-Lane Bridge Shared By Cars And Trains,"In New Zealand, one-lane bridges are a common enough thing that tourists are warned about them. Dunedin Railways started operating in the 1990s. The route is 154km return from Dunedin to the Strath Taieri plain. There are stop signs at either end of the bridge, but you don't do line speed on a road-rail bridge. The train is going at a speed that it can stop pretty easily, and usually the cars have to back up. But if you're doing 10kph, blowing the whistle and all that sort of thing, you just take care and listen out for the train horn. It's really up and down. The scenery is spectacular, how they built it. They started in 1879, it was completed in 1891, all by hand. There used to be a lot more in the country. They were mainly built in less populated areas because trains and cars don't combine very well(!) so you wouldn't build them in the cities. But the cars just have to follow the road rules. They're really there only to give access to two sheep stations, so there's not that much traffic on it. But almost all of them have lights and sirens and barriers to keep cars separated when there's a rain approaching."
146,What Counts As The Steepest Street In The World?,"Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, holds the Guinness World Record for steepest street in the world. Guinness defines the world record as ""steepest street over acontinuous distance of 10 metres"" But the record is challenged by a San Francisco street that hits a 41% grade for just under 10 metres. The street's residents say it's a point of difference for the city, with wildlife, heritage architecture and heritage architecture. It's a nice opportunity, in the end, to bring people to the town, if you are going to crown a steepest road, you have to draw the line at a bit of an angle at the corner. But it's established itself, and there's no doubt that it's the world's steepest, even if other towns and cities mayquibble about the definition, but it's not quite quite quite as catchy as ""Steepest Street in the World"" It is a challenge for the residents of the street to negotiate, for instance, as they find visitors standing on their front lawn or in their garden, taking photos, because we don't always have front fences in New Zealand. But they think that's a good thing, because it's exposed Baldwin Street to more people around the world, and that's what we want."
147,Testing A Zip Line That Goes Round Corners,"Rides and attractions in New Zealand are governed by national standards. But there is no single standard for all rides and attractions. The government can only get involved if a ride is unsafe. The safety of a ride depends on how well it is designed and tested. The company behind the ride has a patent on the technology it uses to make the brakes. The ride is designed to go round corners, rather than around them. It uses springs, centrifugal force and eddy current braking to stop riders falling. It is not possible to test every ride in the country. It's important to comply with national standards, but there are also international standards that can be applied to different rides. The rules are deliberately vague in law, though, so it's easier to say ""everything reasonable"" rather than change the law every time someone invents something new. For more information on ride safety, visit www.ridesafety.org.uk. For information on how to test rides in the UK, visit RideSafe.org or call the RideSafe helpline on 08457 90 90 90.

148,The Circle Visible From Space,"Mount Taranaki is a stratovolcano on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. It's one of the most symmetrical volcanoes on the planet, which adds to the effect. Before humans arrived in New Zealand, most of the country looked like this: dense forest. Māori settlers cleared some of it, but European settlers cleared forest on an industrial scale. In 1900, that area became a National Park,defined as a circle six miles in radius from the summit of the mountain, plus a few other interesting parts on the edge. The volcano is active, just quiet right now, and it's overdue for an eruption. But if it erupts, it could shut down air traffic over the North Island, and the cone could collapse entirely, as it has done several times in the eons when humans weren't around to see it. If you are flying between Auckland and Wellington any time soon, the skies are clear: do enjoy the view. But at some point, it's going to become a bit more difficult, because the volcano is not an extinct volcano. It could also collapse entirely and shut down that flightpath, as well as some other parts of the South Island and the South Pacific. It is not known when the next eruption will happen, but there's an 80% chance of it."
149,The First 3D Color X-Rays,"In the early days of photography, all you had were shades of grey. But x-rays, with a higher.energy and shorter wavelength, can pass through objects a lot more easily. An x-ray photo takes those short wavelengths and translates them into something that our eyes can see. A team in Christchurch, New Zealand, are doing something that, in hindsight, seems really obvious. It's called computed tomography. The goal is to make it as easy. as possible for people to understand, says Dr. Andrew Weldon. The first clinical trial in 2006 is going to start in 2006 on our first mouse, where we were first to be able to do the test. Weldon: We've got to solve tens. of billions of equations before we get a 3D image of what the materials are, and we're doing a lot of computer processing before we do that. We're getting eight different colors, and each one of them is the size of a hair's breadth, he says. We are getting closer and closer to the Higgs Boson, and that's a big deal, says Weldon, who has been working on the project for more than a decade. He says we're getting close to the point where we can do the first clinical test on human subjects."
150,The Brain-Eating Amoebas of Kerosene Creek,"CNN's Richard Quest goes to a hot spring near Rotorua on the North Island of New Zealand. He finds a pool full of people swimming in a pool of amoeba. The organisms can eat the neurons and astrocytes in the brain. There is no treatment, and 97% of people die from the disease. But despite the terrifying name, the grisly stories, the 90-something percentchance of death if you're infected is very rare, Quest says. He also finds a questionable smell in the air, but fortunately that doesn't really come across on camera. He says the warning signs that were once here aren't here any more, but they're still a good reminder of the dangers of swimming in warm, untreated water in hot pools and places like that. The story will be shown on CNN at 10pm on Thursday, November 2. For more, visit CNN.com/Richard Quest.

151,The Hundred-Tonne Robots That Help Keep New Zealand Running,"New Zealand is a long way from almost everywhere else on the planet. Humans only reached here about 700 years ago. The ports of Auckland here and around the country are vital to keeping New Zealand running. The new A-STRADs can stack containers with an accuracy of a couple of centimetres. They can then move the containers just a little bit, spreading the wear and tear on the pavement over a much longer period of time. It's a bit like, you're having open heart surgery while you're still playing tennis, says the man behind the project, Sir Chris Woodhead. He says it's an absolutely crazy thing to do, but we have to do it because of our space limitations. But it's also a really exciting challenge, says Woodhead, because it means we can get a lot more capacity out of our same piece of land. It could be a game changer for New Zealand, he says. It will be a big step forward for the country, and for the world, in terms of containerisation and the future of our economy. It is a very exciting time for the port industry in New Zealand and the rest of the world in general, says Mr Woodhouse, but it's still a very long way to go before we reach the tipping point."
152,The Sculpture That Looks Like A Real-Life Cartoon,"Once or twice a month, the private art collection at Gibbs Farm in New Zealand opens up to the public. The tickets are free, but they go very quickly. The most famous piece in the collection is 'Horizons' by Neil Dawson. The farm is basically one rich millionaire's playground. It was originally bought as a place to drive vintage militaryvehicles. The art came second. But it's still primarily a family holiday retreat. It's not a public park. It’s not a charity. It doesn’t have a museum, it's just a private collection of art. But if you actually want to stand here and experience that optical illusion for yourself, you'll have to join the rest of the queue for tickets. It is not just art on a wall: it's land art, made bymoving vast amounts of soil and earth, or it's sculpture on a scale seen only in a few places in the world. It isn't just a collection of paintings on a walls: it is land art. It could be a piece of corrugatediron blown in from a distant farm... or a giant paper tissue that's been thrown away. It can be a huge spike of metal, but from a distance, your brain just doesn't see that."
153,"Where Two Oceans Meet, Debunked","Cape Reinga, at the very northern tip of New Zealand's North Island, is one of the few places in the world where two oceans collide. Here, at least, you can see the waves from the Tasman Sea coming in from the west and clashing with the Pacific Ocean from the east. The official limits of oceans and seas are defined by the International CroatianHydrographic Organisation, but the truth is a little more complicated. The water here will become part of the massive system that's defined by global weather and ocean currents, and those ocean currents are measured in sverdrup -- a million cubic metres of water moving at a metre per second. It's just one very, very small bit of the ocean that look messy on a human scale because of the land nearby, but it's worth the trip. The truth is just not as dramatic as the guidebooks say, and it's not even where the Tasman sea ends or the Pacific Sea begins, according to the maps. The real story is a lot more complicated than you might think, and there's a long way to go to find out the real story behind Cape Reing a. But it's a great place to start, and I'm looking forward to seeing you there next time."
154,I Drove My Childhood Favorite Racing Game In Real Life,"When I was a kid, one of the video games I played a lot was Need For Speed II. The developers of Need for Speed II were based here in Vancouver, Canada. That track was Vancouver and the area around it, or at least a very simplified version of it. The designers of that track, the artists from Vancouver who created that low-polygon version of their city, never thought that they'd have this sort of effect on anyone. They never thought nearly a quarter-century later, nearly a dozen years later, that their creations would have this kind of effect. But they did, and it's a very strange experience. They have an odd connection to this place. And now, I can do exactly what that young version of me wanted to do. I can drive bits of the track, but more importantly,I can get out and explore. I'm willing to bet that they never thought they'd ever think that they would be remembered in such a way. But I'm almost certainly not the only person in the world who's played that game and then stumbled across the real version, and found that they have a connection to it, too. It's a strange thing to say, but it's true: we're all nostalgic for things we never thought we would be."
155,The Artificial Gravity Lab,"The Artificial Gravity Facility at Brandeis University is a rotating room that rotates. The best way to study artificial gravity on Earth is to build a rotating environment. It is almost impossible to envision a long duration space flight without artificial gravity. The force is not a real force acting on the ball, it looks like one when you're in that rotating environment, but in fact it's a distorted image of the lab because it's so far away from the centre of the room. The lab is the research prototype for how humans deal with a very strange gravitational environment. The experiment is unscripted and there is no guarantee that the results will be the same for everyone. The video was produced by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and was edited by the Institute of Physics at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (IS&T) The video is also available on CNN.com, iTunes, Google Play, and the Amazon.com App Store. For the rest of the video, visit CNN.co.uk/science and click here for the video.

156,Blindfold Balancing in the Spinning Space Chair,"The Spatial Orientation Laboratory at Brandeis University is trying to recreate what an astronaut would experience in space. The lab's Multi-Axes Rotation and Tilt system, or MARTS, was designed to test, in close proximity, gravity-inertial force environments. They blindfold people into the chair so they can't use their visual system, and use noise-cancelling headphones so they're just falling to the left and to the right. Because they're tilting relative to gravity, you can use information about how you are relative to gravitational verticalto figure out where you are. But when you're on your back, the only thing that you really have through your canals and even through your skin is velocity. People become wickedly spatial disorientation and it's so easy to just over-correct over and over. The project is going to trial 20,000 people and is set to be completed in 2015. It will be the first of its kind in the world. It is funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the US Air Force Research Institute. The research is being led by Professor David Houghton. The first test will take place in 2015 in New Mexico. The second will take places in 2016 in California."
157,The Library of Rare Colors,"Inside the Harvard Art Museums, the Forbes Pigment Collection. The pigment collection was put together by Edward Forbes, who was the second director of the museum. The oldest white pigment is lead white. It's made by taking lead metal, putting it into a container with vinegar. Some of the pigments are toxic, so we don't want people touching them. They not just fade, but some pigments darken. They are not used for restoration. We use them only as standards for the analysis of samples from works of art. We can show the students how pigments change. We have 60 different samples of hematite. Each of those is a slightly differentcoloredshade from the other. They're made of mercury, cadmium, mummies and so on. Red lead will turn black on exposure to light, red lead is toxic in the way that mummies have been made. Some pigments like eosin, which Van Gogh used a lot, will fade and give an entirely different impression of what the painting was to what it looks like now. We are developing new ways to depict colors for people to depict new colors. There is a new color called YMn Blue, discovered by accident in the very stable and stable Ynorganic Blue."
158,The Last Play-For-Cash Fascination Parlor,"Hull is a small seaside town near Boston in the northeast United States. It's the last play-for-cash Fascination Parlor in the world. There are 64 machines here, so on a busy night here we'll have 64 players. The game begins with your bill on the glass, and can range anywhere from a quarter and maybe two dollars at a point in time. It is a game of skill, there is some luck that goes into it, but certainly there are some skilled players. But it is winter, it's the off-season, and there are no tourists, so today I am just playing against Chas, the owner of the parlor, for the first time in a year. The owner: ""Every so often, these games will peter out because of their age, but we're looking to make it easy for everyone to join, understand the rules, and get in here and be a part of the fun"" The game is still running oncentury-old technology, with components that are changed in and out, of course. But the reason it's just not... isn't because it isn't old-fashioned fun, yes! I've got you, three, okay, you've got three, yes, okay!"
159,The Broken Building That Must Not Be Destroyed,"St Peter's Seminary was built in the 1960s to be a training school for priests. By the time it was listed in 1992, it had already been closed for years. The building is now a ruin, covered in graffiti, and hard to get back to. The Archdiocese of Glasgow has been responsible for it since the moment it opened. It is one of the most important buildings in Scotland, but it's not easy to get it back to its former glory. It's not just a listed building, it's a grade A listed building. There are no plans to demolish it, just to make room for a new building. It could be used as an arts venue, but there are better places for it to be used. It has a lot of potential, but no one knows what to do with it. The only thing that can be done with it is to try and keep it in good condition, but that's not very easy to do. It would be better to give it to a charity shop, but they can't afford to buy it from the archdiocese. There's no way to get rid of it, so it's in a state of disrepair, and it's difficult to get a new home for it. It will be hard to find a new use for it, because it's so expensive to maintain."
160,A Questionable Experiment in Motion Sickness,"The driver can see the viewprojected on this monitor, and that view is coming from this front-facing camera. The view can be delayed by fractions of a second or by a minute if we wanted to. If the view is only very slightly lagged, the brain just copes with it. If it's lagged by more than a second, then the brain treats it as two separate tasks. It's weird watching a screen to pilot a car, but it can be done. It works the other way, too: You can drive and you feel those reactions, and you use the old view to plot your course. But there's this weird spot.between those two, where the view's just lagged. enough that the brain is trying to reconcile the movement and the view, but the two are unrelated. That's what you find in motion simulators. The brain is constantly failing constantly, failing constantly to reconcile that, that is not pleasant.- No one knows why humans get motion sick.- Why not a migraine or a loss of bladder control? There's a popular theory that says it's because our brainipientthinks we've been poisoned. But that is just a theory. One scientist describes that theory as not just unproven but untestable."
161,Why Denmark Is .10 Seconds Behind The World,"In 1893 a law was put in effect in Denmark, at which point the time of Denmark wassynchronised with international time zones. In reality, Denmark follows theUniversal Coordinated Time, which is used all around the world. The official law in Denmark is defined by a law from 1893, which states that Denmark follows mean solar time. But the Earth wobbles a bit in its rotation, so the official time is not exactly the same all year round, and the Earth also slows a bit over time because of tidal forces from the Moon. The Danish media took up a question to try to change this law, and a minister said that he was actually interested in changing the law. But he said he would not be able to make a change to the law at this point in time, and so the debate has now died down. The debate is still ongoing, however, and we will return to the subject in a few weeks' time to find out what the government is really thinking about changing the laws in the first place.

162,How Auto-Tune Works,"A pure tone is a vibration of air that vibrates back and forth at a certain frequency. If you want to raise the pitch of that tone, you can speed up those vibrations. But because you've sped the vibrations up, that tone doesn't last as long. Because musical notes don't sound like this, they sound like the Gregory Brothers' song, ""The Gregory Brothers"": ""Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between, we are The Gregory Brothers. And we are here to entertain you all!"" ""We have a special treat for you today: an exclusive interview with the Gregory brothers!"" ""Please join us for this exclusive interview."" ""We are the GregoryBrothers, and we are so happy to be here!"" ""This is a special interview for you, The Gregory brothers, and I am so pleased to be with you."" ""Please, join us!"" ""I am the Gregory Brother, and this is aspecial interview for us."" ""I know we're wandering off, but I thought that sounded pretty good. Thank you, Mr. Gregory."" ""Mr. Gregory, I would like to thank you for your time and for all of your hard work."" ""Thank you, gentlemen and ladies, for all your time. I appreciate it very much."""
163,Slowing Down A Stock Exchange With 38 Miles Of Cable,"A modern stock exchange isn't just people yelling at each other to buy and sell things. It's a computer system that pairs them all up, exchanges money and sharesautomatically as fast as it can. The faster they react, the more money they can make. IEX is one of 13 stock exchanges in the US, regulated and established the same way as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The exchange has invested billions of dollars into a technology that has always been controversial in a market that is expected to 'explode' in the next few years. The technology is being used by another stock exchange in the U.S. to slow things down for slow traders, as an exchange, to slow down the market. The IEX exchange is now a fully-fledged stock exchange, with a trading room of more than 1,000 people. It is based in San Francisco and is run by a group of academics and academics from the University of California, San Francisco, and the City of San Francisco. It was founded in 2000 and is now run by the same group as the San Francisco Stock Exchange, which has a trading floor of 1,500 people, and a board of directors of 20. It also has a branch in London, and plans to expand to more than 2,000."

165,This Is Your Brain On Stale Air,"This week's guest video is from Kurtis Baute, from inside his homemade, airtight biodome. With every breath that he takes, Kurtis is exhaling carbon dioxide, which is toxic at high levels. Carbon dioxide levels in bedrooms and cars can reach 4,000 parts per million. At 1,400 parts permillion, there is a 50% decrease in cognitive function, according to studies. The good news is that carbon dioxide levels are going to go up by the end of the century, meaning we have to go all the way up to 30,000, and potentially deadly levels, before it's a problem. The bad news is it's probably bad for your long-term health, but research shows that it's not uncommon for motorcycle helmets to have levels that are that high, let alone at 10,000 part per million or even 6,000. The video is part of a series of videos about how we interact with the air we breathe. The other videos on the series are about the environment we live in and how we react to it, and the effects it has on our health. The videos are available on CNN.com/Heroes and on CNN iReport.com.

166,How Knot To Hang A Painting,"This week's guest video was pitched to me as a puzzle and I couldn't solve it. Physicist Jade Tan-Holmes is going to show you the same puzzle and then solve it with maths. The key is to tie the string so it falls when one of the pins is removed. The puzzle is based on knot theory, which is the mathematical study of tangled systems. The answer is that there is only one way a string can interact with another string, and that is by crossing over it. The video is at the bottom of the page and you can watch it again at the end of the show. It is available in English and Chinese and is available to download on iTunes and the Google Play store.

168,"Why NASA Spun Astronauts Around, But Doesn't Any More","The Multi-Axis Trainer, or MAT, is an icon of space exploration and space training. The MAT spins on three different axes and three different rings. It's based off of something called the MASTIF, which was used during the 1960s Mercury programme. It was never used to actually train astronauts, but as a simulator at Space Camp in Alabama. It spins at 30 revolutions a minute, much faster than the G forces used on the Shuttle and Gemini programs. The trainer is powered by a motor, the inner ring is free spinning, and the outer ring is locked. It can spin in more than one direction twice in a row, so you don't get dizzy or nauseous, but you do get disoriented. It looks really fun, or really terrifying, depending on how close you are to it. It is a really rare experience for most roller coasters, like this one, and it's a real treat for some people who love the feeling of being disoriented without being dizzy, which is a very rare experience. It has been used by the U.S. Air Force and the US Navy, among others, to train astronauts in space and on the moon. It costs about $1,000 per person, or about $50,000 for a family."
169,The Canyon That Humans Made By Accident,"Providence Canyon, a couple of hours' drive from Atlanta, Georgia, is known as Georgia's Little Grand Canyon. The ground here is made of loose sand and clay that was deposited millions of years ago on what was then the sea floor. It's stable, of course, but it's never been compacted into solid rock or cemented together by geology and time. The park management has to move these fences occasionally;sometimes they'll find that one of the spiresout there has just fallen after heavy rain. There are strict no-climbing warnings here, because, well, the rock you're holding onto could justfullyfall away and dissolve in your hand. So my question is: should this count as a                natural wonder? It is part of nature. But exposing them: that was very much human, and I'm fairly sure that was a rockfall from this cliff. Which is worrying. But it's probably fine. It'll probably be fine. And I'm hoping the microphone picked up that noise, because as soon as I turned my camera off, there was a massive noise, and it was the sound of a rock falling. That's what I was worried about. But I'm not worried about it. It was just a rock fall."

173,The City of Golf Carts,"Some American cities have buses. Some use trams and trains. Peachtree City, Georgia, uses golf carts. It's a small city of about 35,000 people 20 minutes south of Atlanta. The city was founded in the 1950s by Joel Cowan, a college student. It got started as a lake retreat for people who were on the weekends, taking their golf carts on the roads, he says. The town now has more than 100 miles of golf carts' paths, which are mostly used for golf carts, the mayor says. ""It's a bit of freedom that they enjoy,"" Vanessa Fleisch says of the city's golf cart drivers. ""I'm still getting over the fact that I'm in a drive-thru in a golf cart,"" she says of a McDonald's drive-through. ""You can soup them up as much as you want really,"" says Fleisch. ""They're very quiet.... It's very... I mean, what I mean by that is, good grief! The Founder got distracted by their ducks, their ducks by their carts, and I got to get out of their way. That's what I like about golf carts,"" says the mayor, who says they're ""very quiet"" and ""very peaceful"""
174,The Artificial Intelligence That Deleted A Century,"Earworm is an artificial intelligence designed to stop people uploading copyrighted music and video to a live-streaming app called Watchnow. It took Earworm around a day to become smarter than a human. It could be called a superintelligence, and the log files that it left behind became meaningless. It had a plan, and it was smarter than anyone could imagine. We're fortunate that Earworm knew that we'd be angry at what it was doing -- and that it didn't care about what we had a job to do -- in some ways, we're lucky that we're still alive. But humanity's growth is stunted, and we'll never know what the future holds for us, or if we'll ever be able to get back to the day when the world was just a single pixel on your screen. It's not the future, it's just a future that we don't know how to get to -- but it could be a very different one, one that could be very, very different from the one we currently live in. We'll find out more about Earworm in the next episode of The Hour, tonight at 10pm ET on CNN.com/U.S. and tomorrow at 11pm ET/PT on CNN TV. For more information, visit the Earworm website."
175,The Other Tree That Owns Itself,"A tree in Athens, Georgia, owns itself after a local landowner wrote a legal document bestowing its ownership onto itself in the early 19th century. Another tree in Eufaula, Alabama, has a nearly-identical story. But this tree does not have a Wikipedia article. It isn't even referenced on the other tree's article. These trees are a metaphor for how success on the internet and, heck, anywhere works. It's not always about how good your story is, it's about how many people are willing and able to pass it on, he says. The story of the tree in Georgia is in a big college town, home to the University of Georgia, and home to students who will arrive from out of town, learn the story, and then leave. The tree in Alabama has a fraction of the population, and no reason for out-of-towners to visit. The stories don't tend to spread as well from places like this, he adds, and it's the same reason that manydifferent ideas take off while others don't: It's all about who you know. ""I'm not sure that's too much of an advantage,"" he says, ""but given that both of them were deeded decades before the internet, I think it's a good thing"""
176,An American Stonehenge: The Mysterious Georgia Guidestones,"Georgia Guidestones in the USA were put up in 1980 by modern people with modern equipment. Inscribed on them in eight languages are rules for a future post-apocalyptic civilisation. The person or people who paid for these stones stayed anonymous, so no-one knows if they were actually intending to troll conspiracy theorists. Maybe they really were just hoping to create a modern Stonehenge, with different rules for different groups of survivors. But until then there's a rule of thumb called Occam's Razor: ""The simplest solution tends to be the correct one"" and a rich person who saw StonehenGE and thought ""I want one of those"" is a pretty simple solution. The full video is available on CNN.com and the CNN iReport app. For more, visit the CNN website and the iReport App. For the CNN Radio version of this article, please visit the http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/news/features/top-stories/stories/topstories/chilling-stories-chilling.html#storylink=cpy.

179,Britain's Largest Battery Is Actually A Lake,"Dinorwig Power Station is one of the largest power stations of its type in the world. It is located at the top of a mountain in Wales. The station is able to meet the peaks and troughs of electricity demand. It can also pump water back into the reservoir at the bottom of the mountain. The power station has a capacity of around 9 gigawatt-hours of storage. It was built with the intent to help the National Grid meet demand and demand instantaneously. It has the capacity to go from zero to its full capacity, maybe 2,000 megawatts, within 10 seconds. It's also one of Britain's fastest-acting power stations, taking advantage of peaks in the electricity market and the troughs in the market, which can be very unpredictable. It also has a very fast response onto the system to help keep the lights on in the event of a power cut, and it's rechargeable, meaning it can be used to store energy for a long period of time. It could also be used as a storage facility for other energy-efficient technologies, such as wind and solar power, or as a backup power source for the electricity grid if the power grid runs out of fuel. It would also be able to be put on standby, if needed, to meet demand for electricity."
180,Why Do London's Manholes Keep Exploding?,"About once or twice a month, somewhere in London, a bit of pavement just goes... boomf. The company that handles the electrical cables under London's streets is spending a lot of money fixing them up. But no-one wants to license security camera footage of actual pavement explosions. So instead, we are going to create our own underground explosion right here with the help of a pyrotechnician. The odds of a manhole in a London street suddenlyexploding while you're next to it are tiny. This is not something to worry about. It's a big city. Things will break. But an electrical fault won't make an explosion. But a steady, slow gas leak in a pipe might not. be detected for a while, and in that time the gas can spread a long.distance through narrow underground tunnels. That's all you need for an explosion in the hole. It'd hurt if you were standing on it, sure, sure. But like I said, it's not something. to be worried about. But it could do serious damage. It could be a real disaster, if you're standing on the wrong side of the road at the wrong time, or in the wrong place, or even in the middle of the street, and it could be deadly."

It's the only language in Unicode where a space is not a space, and can be replaced with a line break. There's been an actual argument about it, among computer nerds and linguistics nerds at the Unicode Consortium. But the final ruling is that it's a space that's also a line, and that's the way it should be used in the modern world, not just the ancient one. The U.S. government is trying to change the rules to make it easier for people to use the alphabet in the 21st century, but it's not easy to change them at the moment.

183,What's The Longest Word You Can Write With Seven-Segment Displays?,"Seven-segment displays are a really cleverbit of design. They're used in everything from clocks to supermarket checkouts to calculators to slot machines. But there's no way you can write an M or a W on this display. So what is the longest English word that can be shown on a seven-se segment display? We'll find out by looking up a list of words in a public-domain dictionary. And then we'll write some code to get it working in a real-life computer. It's not the best language, but it's not bad for beginners, and importantly it's easy for me to explain. And now we have an array of all the words in the English language:.basically just a long list of strings. Let's see how long that array is by telling the console to output the length of the word array:. 370,000 words, each one in a separate item in an array called “words”. And we can filter that list and remove any words that use an obvious pattern:. G is difficult because there's almost a standard pattern for those letters, but we can't use the obvious pattern, because that's 6 or 9’s instead of a standard G. We can also use the After Effectsexpressions that I used to make these words easier to read."
184,How The First Ever Telecoms Scam Worked,"In the late 18th and early 19th century, optical telegraph lines were the fastest way of getting information between major cities. The lines were for official government use only. You could not pay to send messages through them. But that didn't stop two French brothers hiring someone up in Paris. They sent coded messages to the telegraph operators in Tours and Bordeaux. The faster you knew a stock exchange's movements, the more money you could make elsewhere in the country. It's a tradition that goes back to the 18th-century France, and could be an artifact of our weird, 21st-century, hyper-capitalist technology race. It could also be a sign of things to come, as the world of finance continues to get more complex and complex by the day. The story of the first telecoms scam has been repeated a lot in the English-speaking world.

185,"Wingwalking Isn't What It Used To Be, And That's A Good Thing","In the 1920s, daredevils would clamber around the wings with nothing but their own strength. But in the 21st century, wing-walking is a little bit different. At Eastbourne Airshow, we take off from an airfield near Brighton and then they climb up onto the wing. They have a carabiner which slides up and down the wire. The cable is about 60cm long, and they can never be more than 60cm away from the centre line of the aircraft. It's all a bit of an illusion, so it looks like we're not attached. We go at roughly from 80 to 160mph, in between that. And we'll pull up to 4g,ipientso it's a huge strain on our bodies. We can do handstands and we'll also move around. It is exhausting. That is one of the most strenuous things I've ever done. I think I've done. Whoo-hoo! It's like resistance training, it's really hard work. You have about a month of intense training. You practise everything on the ground first, then you just go up in the air repetitively. You fly everyday, all day, and it's absolutely knackering. That's totally different to the1920s!"
186,We Made a Banhammer (feat. NerdCubed)," moderators have created a 'banhammer' to ban people from Twitch chat. The banhammer can be used to ban users for being offensive, dull, or using too many emojis. It works by sending a ban command from a server to a moderator account on Twitch. The command can then be sent back to the server to be used in the chat. It can also have as many different visual effects as it can, like smoke and sparks flying up. It also has an avatar system, which is a bit of a pain to work with. But it's a huge improvement over the old way of doing things. It's a lot of fun to play with, and it's really easy to get used to, so it's great for new players. It will be available to all users in the next few days, but it's not available yet for non-Twitch users. It is available in the UK and the US, and is available to UK and US users in Australia and Canada, with plans to roll it out to the rest of the world in the future. It has been available for a few weeks, but is still in the beta stage and is being trialled in the US and Canada. It costs £1.99 per month to use."
187,The Collapsible Crash Test Robot Car,"Global Vehicle Target is part of the EuroNCAP standard on how to test automated driving systems. It measures the radar reflectivity of a real vehicle, and even the glass, the back of the vehicle, has a certain radar signature. Thatcham Research is a not-for-profit insurance-funded research centre. The new tests will be introduced in 2020, and will include turn-across-path and junction tests. They will also look at the side of the car, and the front of it, to see if it brakes in time. The tests are being carried out on a robot platform that goes up to 50mph, which means you can test safely with both vehicles going at highway speed. The results of the tests are expected to be announced in 2020. The full report will be published in the next issue of the journal Automotive Engineering and Research, published by the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Research (AAER) on November 14th, 2015.

188,Why You Don't Want To Go Viral,"In 1988, Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond wrote “The Manual’, or “How To Have A Number One The Easy Way’ The Manual was a tongue-in-cheek guide to success in the music industry. The advice is as relevant today as the day it was written. A single popular video does not make you a YouTube star, it makes you the person who stands up and repeats that catchphrase over and over again until everyone’s tired of it. If you’ve been tasked by your boss to ‘Make Something Popular,’ you need to learn how to survive under the spotlight. It took me more than a decade of throwingstuff at the internet, steadily building up a small following and learning my trade before I found the Things You Might Not Know format. I wouldn’t be completely bankrupt if this idea didn't work out at least a few times. There are a lot of people who are either supported by their parents, or students with a little time on their hands, or folks who have the means to support themselves. And if you are one of the lucky ones, if your project starts bringing in some money, you are even better off for it. I’m going on a last-minute sleeper train to a remote Scottish island, because it makes it better for your background for your video."
189,The Quiz That Was Shared A Million Times,"The north-south divide is an important thing in English culture. The idea of being ‘northern’ or ‘not northern’is relatable for a lot of people. ‘How Northern Are You’ quiz was one of the biggest online hits I’ve ever been involved in. A million people shared a million times on Facebook in just four days. The game had a big button that let you share your results. It was a hit pretty quickly, but the numbers kept rising and rising. At one point, we had 13,000 people playing this at the same time,and it only took a minute to play it. We’re going to roll through the English Midlands and up through northern England, and while we’'re on our way, I�’d like to tell you the story of one of my biggest online hit. The story of ‘us vs th3m’, the game that turned us all into ‘Us vs Th3m,’ is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £9.99.

190,That Time I Got In Trouble With The Government,"I've been making stuff for the internetpretty much all my adult life. The first time I tried to answer that question was more than ten years ago. I thought I knew it all. But with another decade and a million subscribers under my belt since then, I can at least tell you the rules that I’ve worked by for the last 15 years or so. The short answer is: you just make stuff. The long answer… well, the best way to tell that does not start down in London. It starts down in Scotland, that’s where it all started. It started with a joke that I put together in an hour and a half. It was just a quick joke. But it was the first demonstration of a principle I now know: a project succeeding on its own is a sign of how much effort and money you've spent on it. You’ll see people complain, but I would bet that, sometimes, that is how it works. And maybe that's true, maybe that is. that's how that works. But I would like to bet that it isn't true, because I've made loads of loads and loads of things that have become popular and dirty and quick and dirty that they sank, but something quick anddirty that theyslapped together."
191,Your Private Messages Might Travel Under This Beach,"Under the Porthcurno Beach ran the original telegraph cables that linked Britain with her Empire. During the Second World War, the government's Petroleum Warfare Department installed flame throwers across the beach to try and repel anyone who might try to come ashore and sabotage what's underneath. There are still active telecom cables under the beach, although they don't surface. The Telegraph Museum in Cornwall houses the original cable hut and the cable station that now houses the museum. The cables were dragged up the beach andterminated into old valve terminations in the cable hut, and then the message was relayed underground. The length of the cablesipientamassed about 186,000 miles. They can carry up to 100 gigabytes of data every second, and can be used to talk to people all over the world, from Japan to Japan, and all the way along the way to Australia and New Zealand. It's not a coincidence that the next time you're in a group chat with someone over a video on another continent, just take a moment and remember that there is a beach near there that is not a part of Britain that you're talking to right now. It could be a big coincidence, but it's just one of many that landsomewhere in this part of the UK."
192,"I Hit 3,000-Year-Old Art with a Hammer","The Uffington White Horse is 3,000 years old. It was carved into a hill in Oxfordshire before the British isles had written history. It is by far the oldest chalking figure in the country. The Horse is weeded, scoured and rechalked every year. It would be lost if not for human intervention, and would grow back within 20 or 30 years. The mystery of the White Horse Hill is what makes it so appealing to people that come to see it. It's a very real connection with the folks that came before us, and we want to keep it that way for as long as we can, says the owner of the horse. The horse's owner: ""We're proud of the Horse here. We want it to look its best as longAs we can"" The Horse's owners: ""It's a piece of art. We don't want to lose it."" It's not easy to get a good view of it, so we're not allowed to fly a drone over it. We're taking new chalk from the quarry just behind me, 50 metres away, about 50 tonnes in all, and smashing it into the Horse with a club hammer. We hope to preserve its appearance and keep its longevity, as people have done for the last 3,00 years."
193,Testing The Sound Mirrors That Protected Britain,"These are the Sound Mirrors on Romney Marsh on the south-east coast of England. In the 1930s, these were Britain's experimental early warning system. They would pick up the low hum of an aircraft engine 27 miles out to sea. They were never used in wartime, but it does still work. The sound waves from the bass of a plane engine have a wavelength that is much longer than the whole surface of those mirrors. The mirrors are 90 years old, but they are still in good condition. They have been used to test new radar technology on the RAF Starrship channel, which is still in use today. They are also used to monitor the movement of aircraft in the sky, as well as other noise from the air, such as the hum of a propeller or the sound of a distant plane's engine. They can also be used to track the direction of approach to an incoming plane, which can be very useful in the event of an attack on the airbase. But they are also very vulnerable to damage from wind and other noise, and they have been damaged in the last few years by a drone buzzing nearby. It is hoped that a new generation of sound mirrors will be built on the Romney Marsh site in the future. They will be much more secure."
194,The Nuclear Reactor Run By Students,"The TRIGA reactor is run by students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. It's designed to be operated by students and used as a training reactor. The water at the bottom of the reactor becomes radioactive, it has N16 in it. The radiation levels are actually very low, but the water provides sufficient shielding. The reactor doesn't get hot enough to melt down. It doesn't explode. It is safe for us to be in here while the reactor's operating. We have a special button, it's called the SCRAM button. It cuts power to those electromagnets and it automaticallyshuts the reactor down. We think we have enough uranium.to continue operating at our current rate for 100 years. Without having to change it out, we'd have to replace it every 10 years. We've got a pretty good success rate. We can put 80 things in there and get them out with a fishing rod. You need to be able to explain how the physics work, how to protect yourself from radiation and how to use the reactor to actually use the controls of the nuclear reactor. There are a couple of dozen research reactors in the U.S. alone, but there are more than a dozen in universities and research institutes. The United States alone has a student society with a lot of regulation."
195,How The 90s VHS Look Works,"The VHS look has been popular lately in music videos and other video art. Some producers will actually put their nice, crisp HD footage through an actual video recorder. But let's be honest, most won't. So, we went to Goodwill and second-hand stores and picked up VHS and SVHS decks. We used a clean reference image that we could latercompare the recorded version on the deck to. When you take an original, clean version and the post-VHS version, line them on top of each other, you can create a lookup table, which allows us to define the colour differences between the two images. The hardest part about that was just getting the tape out of the VCR decks. It's an analog format, not storing ones and zeros, it's storing patterns on a magnetic tape. There are things like what we call the pop lines, when you are recording tape and you get pieces of dust or debris or whatever stuck to the tape. One line will create a streak across the screen, then there's also a scrolling wrinkle. And there's ""at the same time next week, a programme chosen for you for you by the Algorithm""Coming up later, Disillusion, by Tom Alby, on Channel 4 at 9pm."
196,Stories I Can't Tell,"There are several tales from Canada                that I am not qualified to tell. Rather than tell them myself, I'm asking you to go and listen to some other people. There's no adverts on this video, because I would like to give some time to other people to speak. So take a moment, look at the links on screen, or if you prefer to research by reading, pull down the description. It is time for me to let some                other people have a say. And I'm not a historian, so please don't tell me what you think I am. I'm just telling you what I think I should have said, and that's all that matters.

197,We Should Let Some Wildfires Burn,"British Columbia has had record-breaking temperatures, droughts, and fire seasons. The Elaho wildfire in 2015 burned an area the size of Manhattan over 10 weeks. In absence of fires, the fuels have built up in the forests, and now, when we have fires, they're even more intense than they were in the past. A pilot has started a new program called Gravity by Gravity, which will try to restore ecosystems to their natural state. The pilot will be Bradley Friesen, the dog-pilot back at the U.S. base in Whistler, British Columbia, and he'll be joined by Dr. Lori Daniels at U.BC. The program will be called Gravity, by Gravity and it will be on U.B.C.'s Discovery Channel, starting at 9 p.m. ET/PT. For more information on Gravity, go to www.gravitational.com and www.stargate SG-1.com. for more information about the program, or to sign up for the Gravity channel, call 1-800-273-8255 or go to http://www.globaltv.com/globetv/programs/gravitation-by-gravit."
198,The Drink With A Human Toe In It,"The Sourtoe Cocktail is a cocktail with a severed human toe in it. The toe is a hammertoe, which was deformed and had to be removed. The toes we receive from donors are mostly anonymous. The health inspector gives us the okay to do it. It's just like having a bit of beef jerky in there, that's being used as a garnish. But the owner of the jerky would be much less likely to consent than the owners of the toe. You must be warned, the toe must not enter the mouth or mouth, or be bitten, chewed, swallowed, or a $2,500 fine will be imposed. The cocktail is served four nights a week at a bar in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada, where the toe was first served in 1973. It costs $2.50 for a shot of liquor, at least 40% or higher, and the toe is still going in it, but I'm pouring off the liquor, and putting the toe in some ginger ale instead. It started in 1973, so the number could be 100,000. That's since June 11, 1995, and we are at 77,888, but that's since March 11, 1994. It is safe, I mean, the health inspector gave us the OK to do this."
199,Watching for Nuclear Attack at the Top of the World,"The shortest route between Russia and the United States is over the north pole. If the Cold War had ever become Hot, the bombs would have been going straight over here. This is Tuktoyaktuk, on the Arctic Ocean, in the Canadian Northwest Territories. It was once the military's DEW Line: the Distant Early Warning Line. The Line was built in the 1950s at a cost of around half a billion dollars. It lasted about five years until it was obsolete. Now, it is part of a modern radar defence around the whole continent that can detect basically anything inbound at any altitude. But it's still not safe to go near it, and the cleanup is still going on, so I'm not allowed to go there at all. The site is now part of the North Warning System, which detects basically anything at all altitude, including missiles and nuclear warheads, and can detect them with a radar system that's much more advanced than the one that was once used in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The system is still in use today, but it's not as effective as it was in the '50s and '60s, when it was first put in place. For more information, visit www.northwarningsystem.org."
200,The New Highway to the Arctic Ocean,"Inuvik is a small town of about 3,000 people 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Canada doesn't just have a west and east coasts, it has a north one as well. In 2017, an all-weather highway finally opened from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic Ocean. The future of the Canadian Arctic is unknown right now, as the permafrost is melting and sea level rise is already threatening the region's water supplies. The government has closed the road, at least for now, but sooner or later, the road will be fixed and the highway will reopen, CNN's John D. Sutter says. ""We're just used to the way we're living all the time,"" says Sutter. ""This is a proper town. It's just very far north. And it's just going to be just going in a different direction now,"" Sutter adds. ""And that's going to change things here. I'm excited about it."" ""It's a very exciting time for us all,"" says Canadian Arctic expert John Defterios. ""I think we're going to see a lot of changes in the Arctic in the coming years and decades."" ""The Arctic is going to become a much more important part of our lives,"" Satter says."
201,"Freezing 200,000 Tons of Lethal Arsenic Dust","In the 20th century, morethan 200,000 tonnes of gold were extracted from the rock underneath Yellowknife, Canada. The mine closed in 2004, and the government has been left to clean up the mess. The government plans to freeze the rock around the toxic arsenic trioxide, which has no scent, no taste, and dissolves in water. Freezing the arsenic doesn't make it less toxic, but it does make it impossible for any water to seep in and then carry the arsenic out. The project could start as early as summer 2020, but the trade-offs are such that it could be as late as the summer of 2023 before the project is finished. The Canadian government is funding the project indefinitely until a different solution arises, but there's nothing on the horizon at the moment. It will take a little longer, just as fast as it did with the previous project, to get the gold back to the surface, but we'll be able to get back to work by the end of the year. It's a long way off, but I think we're on the right track, I think. It'll be a big step forward for Canada, and for the world, if we can get this project off the ground and into the real world."
202,Tilting an Icy Floor Until You Fall Over: WinterLab,"21,000 people in Ontario every winter end up in emergency rooms because they fall on the ice and snow. WinterLab at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute tests people's ability to walk on ice. The aim is to test the boots, inform consumers what they should buy and help companies develop better boots. It's an icebox really, it's insulated. We can generate winds, we can actually make nice, white, fluffy snow, and we can control the air temperature very precisely. We are really quite confident that eventually we're going to be able to add some more snowflakes at the four and five level. We're a long way off that yet, but of course, more than half.the falls that you experience are people tripping up. I'm not deliberately trying to do that! I swear! I'm trying to be a bit of a good sport about it, you know. I mean, I'm in Toronto, Canada, and it's cold. And Toronto is cold for a lot of the year. But I'm really happy to be here. Thank you very much to the team at WinterLab. For more about their research and their research, visit the Challenging Environment Assessment Laboratories' website.

203,The Town That Was Burned for Science: Aultsville,"The St. Lawrence Seaway was one of the largest public works projects in North America's history. The seaway was a 1950s expansion of small canals and waterways into a huge, navigable path for shipping between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes. The expansion came at a cost, though. The residents of Aultsville, Ontario, were told they had to move and see their old town demolished and then drowned beneath new, higher water. The researchers were scientists from the Building Research Division of the National Research Council of Canada. They burned a total of eight buildings, including six single-family homes, one two-story school, and one community hall. They got a lot of different data, including things like carbon monoxide concentration, smoke density,rise of temperature, oxygen levels. They found out that the noise levels produced by a fire was not enough to wake a sleeping occupant when the bedroom door is closed. The results from the research really helped change the way everything was built in the developed world from the 1960s onwards, because the results from this project were so valuable. The St. Louis Seaway is open to the public now, but it's not all-infrastructure like it was in the 1950s and '60s. For more information, go to: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/science/science-and-design/st-lawrence-seaway."
204,The US-Canada Border Splits This Road Down The Middle,"The official line is that this is Canada and that's the USA, but both countries' maps show the road as being entirely in the US. The houses are definitely in separate countries, but the road is not quite as clear. Even on that side of the road, I am considered to be still in Canada, as long as I don't stop and walk up to an American house. There's a little bit of leniency here, if you're just nudging the border by a few centimetres. There are local stories about drunk surveyors and pranks, but no one really knows what's going on. The police turned up, lights flashing, to move along those bikers you saw earlier who were admiring the view. They had crossed the border, but they were in good spirits, but it's not tolerated no more. But you stay on the Canadian side, and you go through the front door, and it's permitted. It's not as bad as it used to be, but you have to report at customs. The rule hasn't changed much,ipiently but they're more enforced. The road doesn't run at exactly the sameangle as the border,. not precisely. But there's a sidewalk on theCanadian side, so back years ago, it was tolerated."
205,A Town Called Asbestos,"The town of Asbestos, Quebec, was named after the biggest asbestos mine in the world. The town's mayor tried to change the name in 2006, but the idea was voted down. The name attracts people like me, and viewers like you, to visit the town and document its history. But the town's residents are tired of the name, and don't want to change it. They say asbestos was part of their identity, and it was made right here by the men who worked in the mine. But it's now banned in France, after four men died from mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. It's not clear why the town hasn't changed its name. But they say they're tired of being called 'asbestos' and 'the town with the name' by people who don't know the history, and just want to make fun of them for being called it. For more, visit CNN.com/Asbestos and the CNN iReport channel on Facebook and Twitter, or click here for more information on how to get involved in the campaign to get Asbestos banned in your country, or visit CNN's Asbestos campaign.

206,Keeping Aircraft Safe without Radar: The North Atlantic Tracks,"Nav Canada Area Control Centre in Gander, Newfoundland, manages air traffic over the North Atlantic Ocean. There's no radar coverage up here, and no real-time view of where all the hundreds of planes currently are. Air traffic controllers use radio operators, flight service operators, and weather models to communicate with the planes. The North Atlantic tracks are the shortest, and cheapest way around the globe of the earth, and are three-dimensional. They can be separated because planes are on a different track, or because they're on different positions on the same track, by altitude. The tracks can look curved and inefficient on the flat map projections we're used to, but you've got to remember, they're great circle routes. They're running 60 nautical miles apart, which is a normal standard for our tracks, and vertical, we're using 1,000 feet. If an aircraft gets too tight, as soon as an aircraft, interjects and says, ""okay, you up, speed up, or speed down, right?"" the plane will slow down, or stop. If a plane has an emergency, they have contingency procedures that say, ""you have to climb, or descend, or whatever is necessary"" If you're flying over the Atlantic, these are some of the people keeping you safe."
207,⚫ How The Black Point Message Crashes Android Apps,"Text rendering bugs are nowpretty commonplace and pretty dull. But there is something interesting in the characters used to do it this time round. Hidden inside the Black Spot text are about two thousand characters that swap the direction of text back and forth. These invisible characters have been used for quite a bit of trickery over the years. They're just regular characters that have a width of zero and a height of one. But they can also tell the text rendering system to go left-to-right or right- to-left. The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm defines several types of invisible characters that tell theText Renderer to go right to left or left to left. They can be used to trick people into writing wrong-way text on the web. It's really confusing and boring, but I've put a link to the description below if you do want to know the details.

208,2½ Hours of Unedited Garlic Bread Flight Footage,"- So you're going to take off in that direction?- Yeah. I'll be running away with the wind a bit. I like how that sounded good. I'm going to say ""this is not a normal video"", and I'm just going to keep shouting after the camera. It's going to be a bit of a mad dash, but it'll be worth it.

209,"We Sent Garlic Bread to the Edge of Space, Then Ate It","We're going as high as we can with this payload. It's very cold on the way up. It gets warmer as you approach that sort of altitude. The atmosphere's so thin up there, about 1% of the pressure at ground level, that it's close enough. We're going to send half up with the balloon and then leave half on earth for a real taste test. As it goes up, the atmosphere is getting thinner and thinner and there's less and less air pushing in. Eventually the balloon will pop and the equipment will parachute down to the ground. And we'll go and recover it. We normally predict the landing spot within about five miles when we launch the balloon. They send a signal with a GPS position to theground and that's put on a map and we chase the balloon's predicted landing spot. We've never lost one. I've done lots of high-altitude ballooning for about 10 years. Sent one to its doom a couple of times. I think they're still running. I suppose, at least, we've got at least two cameras I suppose still running, so we're okay to go. Oh dear! Let it do it! I think this is the way-Well, I think it's just on the end of that row."
210,"G-Force, Jerk, and Passing Out In A Centrifuge","In the 1950s, the US Air Force used rocket sleds to push volunteers to incredible speeds. USAF flight surgeon John Stapp holds the record for the highest sustained g-force anyone has ever voluntarily endured, 25g for 1.1 seconds. G-induced consciousness or G-LOC-LOC is not dangerous in itself, but when you're flying an aircraft you're not able to fly that well. The real point is when you lose your head, you could even lose consciousness, and we term that g-loss of consciousness as 'gasping' and 'g-induced loss of consciousness' The Royal Air Force's centrifuge has been at Farnborough since 1955 and is used for training pilots as much as it is for research. The first time pilots go on the centrifuge, they expect them to get up to 5g without a g-suit, and then up to 7g with an anti-g-suit. The centrifuge doesn't have much jerk, about 1g per second, which is the difference between a rocket to space and a fighter jet, where manoeuvres might change the G force acting on you in a fraction of a second. It can go further than that, and it can measure the rate of change of jerk which is called snap or jounce."
211,Making an International Standard Cup of Tea,"The International Standard Cup of Tea is the first of its kind. It's not meant to make the perfect cup of tea, but a reproducible one. To make it, you have to buy a copy of the standard and use specialist equipment. It tastes okay, but as far as I can tell, it isn't perfect. But it's close enough to being the most British cup of Tea you've ever had. The instructions are pretty simple: measure out 2g of tea per 100ml of water, plus or minus 2%. And then you let it steep for six minutes, which seems a bit long, but hey, that's the standard. The standard doesn't ask for any of that. It just tells you what to do, and how to do it. But there's a separate standard, ISO 1839, on how you actually sample it, and what you report. And it doesn't matter: there is no perfect cup, only the right one for you. The first International StandardCup of Tea can be found on the internet at: http://www.iso.org.uk/standard/cup-of-tea-for-online-cups.html. For more information on the International Standard for Tea, visit: www.isos.org/standard.uk. For regular tea at home, make your tea in a mug or bowl."
212,The US President's Bulletproof Railcar,"U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first sitting U.s. President to fly in an airplane, back in 1943. But for most of his presidency, he used a very different form of travel, the Air Force One. The car is the heaviest rail car ever built, weighing 285,000 pounds. It was never painted red, white, and blue, and was always painted Pullman green. It is the only car in the world that is not armor-proofed, and it has two escape hatches in the car. It has a toilet, a lavatory, a bathroom, and a dining room. It also has a pressurised bathroom, a shower room, a gym and a gymnasium. But it also has an office, a kitchen, a laundry room and a utility room. The President's office is in the back of the car, where he would sign papers and sign autographs. He would then go out and give speeches to the crowd. He used to make up to eight speeches a day, but now he only makes one a week. He has a private office in the White House, and he uses it to make speeches to his staff. He also uses it for personal errands, such as picking up and dropping off his mail."
213,The 1940s Mermaid Show That's Still Pulling Crowds,"The Weeki Wachee mermaid show has been running for more than 70 years. The water is 74.2° year-round in the natural spring at the top of a massive system of caverns. Hundreds of millions of litres of water force its way out of the ground every day. The show attracts turtles, otters, manatees and alligators. The state of Florida bought the attraction in 2008 in an effort to save it from becoming ""retro"" ""Retro"" can be a good thing, says one of the show's performers. ""We do a lot of dealing with kids in the community and that's really a really good part of the job,"" says Newt Perry, a former diver and diver for the U.S. Navy. ""Being a mermaid is the best job any one could ask for,"" he says. ""It's a living history that still has a day that still shows that you're still a bit of a living legend in our community"" ""We're not just a place to swim in the water. We're a place that's a part of Florida's history,"" says another mermaid, ""and we're proud to be part of that history"" ""I think that's the most important thing that we can ever do,"" says Perry. ""I'm here to make a difference."""
214,How Formation Flying Works (feat. the Red Arrows!),"The Red Arrows are the best aerobatic team anywhere in the world. They fly at hundreds of miles an hour just metres apart from each other. They train for seven months before they even display their manoeuvres near the public. The skill of formation flying is essentiallytriangulating a position. It's a three-dimensional game, and pilots must trust each other to do it safely and effectively. The Red Arrows have been flying since 1980. They are based in Lincolnshire, but have a base in RAF Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, in the West Midlands, and an air base in the North of England. They have a total of nine aircraft on display at the Royal Air Force Museum in Wiltshire, which is home to the Red Arrows' home base. The RAF Museum is open to the public, and has a range of activities for the public to visit, including a museum of aerobatics, a flying museum, and a flying centre. The museum is open from 9am to 10pm every day, and is open for business from 9pm to 11pm on weekdays. It is also open on the weekend, but is closed on Sundays and public holidays. The Museum's website can be found here: http://www.royalairforcemuseum.org.uk/."
215,"Why European Clocks are Running Slow, and British Clocks Aren't","The European grid has been slightly underpowered since the middle of January. Clocks over in Europe have lost six minutes over the last couple of months. Power grids on this side of the Atlantic run at a frequency of 50 hertz, fifty cycles a second. Britain's grid is connected through two undersea cables, one under the English Channel from France, and the other one from the Netherlands, which is near... the Isle of Grain, near the coast of England. The grid is not synchronised to the British National Grid here. The problem is that the British grid is going to run at 50 British cycles aSecond, as Her Majesty intended, while mainland Europe's is running at 49.996 hertz. The solution is to get the European grid back up to frequency, and hopefully politics will solve that. But when it is fixed, should the European authorities bring the grid back to 50? Or should they run it slightly fast for a few weeks? If they do, it'll bring everything back that wasn't manually corrected... but anyone who has already changed their clocks will then find them starting to run six minutes fast. Or they're showing 12:00 because no-one's bothered to program them, because they're not the point, not at the point."
216,The Moiré Effect Lights That Guide Ships Home,"The light is based on moiré patterns, which are the extra lines and patches that appear when you have two similar but slightly different patterns overlaid on each other. The patterns are set up so that if you're looking straight at that light, you see parallel lines. If you're to either side, the arrows formed by the patterns tell you which way to go. The light follows the path of an underwater signal, where you shouldn't drop anchor. It was patented by Lars Bergkvist and Ivan Forsen, from Sweden, in the late 1970s, but the patent was then assigned to a company called Inogon, or ""Inogon leading mark"" The light isn't being used to guide people in the water, but it's a very expensive guide for people to pass through. It's a really good idea that I couldn't believe it wasn't well-known. I considered starting a new series of videoscalled ""I Don’t Know"" just to see if anyone knew more about it, because it's genius and I wanted to understand it. But if anyone does know more, please share it with us at CNN iReport. Back to the page you came from.""I Don't Know"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at what's trending on the Web."
217,Launching An Entire Fireworks Display At Once,"Fireworks display company has changed the way they set off fireworks. Instead of a 10 minute sequence, they're going to fire all of the cues almost instantaneously together. The change has been described as a technical hitch or, worse, human error. But the company says the problem is not with the human, it's with the button that fires the fireworks. The company's prelaunch checklist is designed to make sure the system is ready for the show. It's all about'mitigating against' anything that could go wrong, says the company's chief executive. The firework display is set to go off in 10 seconds, rather than the usual 10 minutes. The show will be an aerial show with shells fired out of tubes that you can see behind us. It will also include ground-level effects such as mines and mines without the lifting charge, and a couple of slices that will throw out width. The fireworks will be launched up to height, throwing stars out ranging from 60 to 120 metres. The display will be held at the Sydney Opera House until the end of the day on Sunday. The event is open to the public and is open from 9pm-11pm, with tickets costing £20-£30. For more information, go to: http://www.globaltimes.co.uk/news/world/2013/01/26/3838/globally/fireworks-show-to-be-held-in- Sydney-from-9pm-10pm.html.html?storylink=true."
218,The European City Centre With No Street Names,"Mannheim, Germany, is the only city in the world where streets don't have names. Instead, they're just numbers and blocks, and are known as Quadrates. Google and Microsoft can't cope with this, and refuse to use it on their maps. But OpenStreetMap, which is community-led, recognises addresses but not individual blocks. It will be fixed within a few hours of this video being uploaded to YouTube. The full video is here: http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/28/technology/mannheim-quadrates-street-names.html#storylink=cpy. The video is also available on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and the App Store.

219,Making Artificial Earthquakes with a Four-Tonne Steel Ball,"Emil Wiechert created the first real working seismometer in 1903. His assistant, Mintrop, used dynamite to measure the size of an oil field in Mexico. The equipment we have here started to work in 1903, and it's still working. We take the flame of a paraffin burner to get soot onto a piece of paper. We think we are the only ones in the world who are doing that. It's a lot easier to set up and calibrate an earthquake detector if you can make the ground shake yourself. The researchers here a century ago could create a tiny artificial earthquake and then measure it. This knowledge spread all over the world. But nowadays there's much better equipment for figuring out what's under the earth's surface but, uh, it's not quite as dramatic. I told you your camera would fall...! [laughter] It's still rolling! It's not as dramatic as I'd hoped. But it's a good reminder of the power of the human mind. It can be used to help us understand the world we live in, and to make better decisions about the future. It is also a great way to learn about our planet's geological history, and the history of our own planet, as well as how we got here."
220,"Faceswapping, Unethical Videos, and Future Shock","A new app lets you swap your face into movie scenes. The code for the app has been around for a couple of months. It was developed and used to create non-consensual pornography. The software is available for anyone with a Windows 10 PC, a powerful Nvidia graphics card, moderate tech skills and poor or no sense of empathy. It shows you a load of faces that look like some sort of ham-wall of ham. The right one is what it's looking for. After 10 minutes, they're starting to become'recognisable' After 24 hours of training, it's nearly a whirring fans and nearly a blurred-over-graphics card, it was blurred. But after 48 hours, I thought that some of it might be good enough to try, so here's the question: with 48 hours oftraining, you can still convincingly still look at all of these faces. Do you recognise any of these people? If so, send us a video to jennifer.smith@mailonline.co.uk or tweet @jennifer_smith. If you don't, send me a video of your own, and I'll send it to you. I'm not going to show anything adult-rated or ethically questionable in this video."
221,Controlling An Airport From 80 Miles Away,"London City Airport is building a new control tower to replace the 30-year-old one. But that new tower won't have any people in it. It'll just be a tall mast with a lot of cameras. The people will be 80 miles away. The new tower will go live in January 2020. It will be the first one in a major city with this level of air traffic. The data is compressed at site and squirted down a couple of big pipes down to Swanwick. If a screen fails, the system is clever enough to recognise that the screen has failed, then transmit that image onto a spare screen. The cameras, in their entirety, fail, but we effectively manage the transition to the same type of operation. If the cameras fail, we just manage that transition slowly, slowly. We don't want this to sound like a sponsored video. But having visited the new control centre in the new centre of London isn't rational. It isn't the rational part of the brain of my brain. It's just the part that's in the brain in the centre of the body. It doesn't come from the same brain as the rest of the human brain. But it's a good, solid, solid part of your brain, that's for sure."
222,Canada's Most Successful King,"Evan Hadfield first met Evan Hadfield on a trip to the Arctic. He is a man who somehow has the ability to de-escalate any argument. He's a good example of how you don't have to be great at being a person to be a great politician. Canada's 10th Prime Minister was a sexually repressed, hypocritical, guilt-ridden, prostitute-visiting mama's boy. He ran the country through the Depression and the Second World War. He was a firm believer in the occult, going so far as to study his shaving cream for political omens. But despite his faults, he could provide a good government in spite of his faults. He could provide good government and good prosperity, and that's a legacy. It's kind of like being a dentist with bad pay, but there is something you get as a politician that you can get unlike almost anywhere else, like the power to change people's lives for the better. It is the driving force of legacy, and the value of being weird. It can be a very difficult thing to tell stories about people sometimes, but today's guest has no such problem. He will be on Rare Earth at 9pm ET/PT on CBC Radio One and CBC Radio Two at 10pm ET /PT."
223,A Language Made Of Music,"The Universal Musical Language, or Solresol, was invented in the mid-19th century by a French musician named Jean-François Sudre. The key of the language is that it's only made up to 4 syllables, with the rest divided into 7 groups based on the first two notes of each note. It's a language that was bound to no particular country, but one that every person learned in addition to their native tongue, allowing free communication across cultural borders. For the first time ever, this week's guest videouses art and animation, and uses pen and paper, piano notes, and doodles of elephants, as well as the 12tone channel. The video is called ""12tone: The Language of Music"" and is hosted on 12tone's YouTube channel, 12tone.com. The channel is now open to the public for the first ever time, and can be followed on Twitter @12tone and @CNN12tone, and on Facebook at 12tone and CNN.com/12tone. The language of music is also available on iTunes and Google Play, and is available in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish. It is not available in the UK, but in the U.S. and Canada, it is available on the iTunes App Store."
224,Sign Language Isn't Universal,"This week's guest is Rikki Poynter, a deaf vlogger who makes videos in both English and American Sign Language. She explains why sign language is not universal and why there are more than 300 sign languages in the world. She also explains why some signs are used in multiple sign languages, such as “Where?” in ASL is “What?’ in BSL. Next week, a video that's a little bit related to deaf history, but also a bit musical. And remember, Rikki's channel is about her life, not just ""all your sign language questions answered"" (although there will be a lot of detail there) Back to Mail Online home.

225,17 Tonnes of Spinning Glass: Making the World's Largest Telescope,"The Giant Magellan Telescope is being built in Chile and will see first light in 2022. The world's largest spinning furnace is filled with 38,000 pounds of molten glass. It takes around two and a half years to make enough glass for a single mirror. The GMT-5, which is the 20th mirror being cast right now, is the first to be made at the Ohara glass factory in Japan. It spins to make the shape we need for a parabola-shaped mirror to collect and concentrate light into the shape needed for a telescope. This is a massive improvement over the massive mirrors used to be used to study stars and exoplanets in the Milky Way and other galaxies. It's also a great way to make money for the University of Arizona, which has a team of physicists andastronomy majors making a YouTube channel called Active Galactic Videos. The channel is taking this month off, and while I'm away, some other folks are taking over my channel. I am genuinely annoyed that I couldn't go out and film this myself. I'm so excited to see what you've got coming up this week! I'll be back in a few weeks with a new episode of ""The Daily Discussion"" with more science and space-related news."
226,This Video Is 2D And 3D Simultaneously: the Pulfrich Effect,"The effect works by sending a different picture to each eye at the same time. It's called the Pulfrich effect and was first documented in the early 20th century. It works best on a big, bright screen, wearing dark sunglasses, and if your device is playing this video at a high frame rate. But because there have to be two separate images on the same screen, it's not practical for anything more than quick gimmicks like this video. The effect also works as a normal 2D video as well, but it's more useful for something like Doctor Who, which is shot in 3D and uses the same technique. It also works by moving objects in the frame, so every camera shot has to be carefullyplanned, and in constant motion, so you won't see it in the cinemas any time soon. But if we stop the camera rotating, the effect Disappears, which everyone can take a breath away from, and it's pretty useful for things like TV shows and video games. The full video is available on CNN.com and the iReport app for iPhone, iPad and Android. To watch the full video, go to CNN iReport.com/3D and the Apple Store for iPhone and iPad, or the Google Play store for Android."
227,The Null Hypothesis,"BrainFly is an experiment to see if brain-computer interfaces can be used for very extreme situations, such as space. The participants are going to play a game called ""shoot-the-alien"" and their brain activity will be used to control a cannon. In the best case scenario, the BCI's still controllable, the data's not noisy, and all nine participants give perfect data. But in practice, humans don't work that way and there is still a stigma that, if you get a negative result, you have somehow failed. The link is in the description of the program, Yoursis. Yoursis is the name of the programme behind the BrainFly program, The Fly, which is on BBC2 tonight at 10.30pm (UK time) and tomorrow at 11.30am (GMT) and on Sunday at 10pm ( UK time) on BBC1.

230,Why Hold Music Sounds Worse Now,"Early telephone calls were put through by a human operator connecting the two phone wires into one circuit. The standards for phone calls, even today,rely on quick-and-dirty compression built decades ago. But compression is great at encoding one clear voice -- but chuck a load of complicated music at it and it's going to sound bad. And in the worst case, that music isn’t just compressed by the phone company on its way to you. It’s already been compressed by a completely different system that has probably been built by the lowest bidder. The phone company takes. that already-mangled signal and mangles it in a different way as it travels to. you. But music can't survive...[MUSIC TO STATIC]...and their gallery is just open to play with them. Connected Earth is just a police box. This is not just a TARDIS. Pull down the description for more about them for more details about how they work. And for more information, visit the Milton Keynes Museum's Connected.

231,The German Town That's Literally Breaking Apart,"The town of Staufen, near the Black Forest in south-west Germany, is cracking. The ground is expanding, bulging up, and forming cracks in almost every house. The government tried to drill a geothermic energybore, but it didn't work. The drilling company settled out of court for more than €1m, but the cost of the damage is estimated at more than 50 times that. The town hall was built in 1546, and the ground is now swelling by about a centimetre per month. It's not a single plane, so in reality you would need a big, big plug and you don't even know where it exactly is, says filmmaker Constantijn Crijnen. He also has his own YouTubechannel where he's building a 3D printer from scratch, go check him out.

232,Is It Dangerous To Talk To A Camera While Driving?,"The National Advanced Driving Simulator at the University of Iowa is used to test drivers' reactions in a controlled, repeatable environment. The simulator has a real vehicle cab in it and can swap different vehicle cabs, in and out. The motion base can travel 64 feet in the X and Y directions and there is a turntable that can turn 330 degrees in either direction. It has 13 independentdegrees of freedom and is controlled by the weather and traffic. It is also used to simulate things that would be unsafe in the real world, such as unintended acceleration, and to test driver response to a large dose of alcohol. It can also be used to study driver impairment, driver drowsiness, driver distraction or intoxication, and even to test the effects of cannabis on the driver's body. It's not up to modern video game standards, but after a few minutes in the simulator, your brain just accepts that you're driving, says the simulator's creator, Dr David Hoyle. The National Advanced driving Simulator is available to buy online for £1,000. For more information, visit: www.nationaladvanceddrivingsimulator.com.

233,The Lava Lamps That Help Keep The Internet Secure,"Computers aren't very good at picking random numbers. Cloudflare is a service that protects websites and web services. It uses a system of lava lamps to create random data. The data is then fed into the Linux kernel which uses it to help seed random number generators that are used to generate keys. The company is one of the first to do this, but it's not the first company to try and do it. It was patented by a company called Silicon Graphics in 1996, but that only lasted a couple of years. It's possible to write code that will simulate randomness, but in theory, those numbers could be predicted. If you could simulate all that, even if you'd gone to some other company, you'd only be one piece of the puzzle away from cracking encryption in the first place. But that sort of humaninteraction is nowhere near enough for an operation on this scale. The world is truly random, and that's arguably a question ofphilosophy and not science. But maybe everything is just a little more complicated than we first thought, and we're just getting closer to the end of the road, as it's been suggested by some of our friends. We're looking forward to seeing what the future has in store for us."

The paint is donated by visitors from all over the world. Knight: ""The biggest thing is this: I love this place all the more because I've tried to paint it all beautiful and keep it beautiful and make it the same way I want it to be. And I've been living here a year and a half and I'm thepreservationist of this place. I just love it all the less because I'm here to care for it."" ""I'm the preservationist of the place and the same thing I'm trying to paint all the same ways I want to make it beautiful is the same. And that's what I'm going to continue to do,"" he says. ""I'll keep trying to do it the way I used to."" ""It's amazing. I've met people from Africa, Europe, all over Europe, tofloating little islands and this and that, it's amazing,"" he adds. ""And some people, they come here for the religional deals on it, cool. Some people come here to take pictures at a pretty place, and that's cool too. It's getting you out, you're doing stuff."""
235,"What Is Sea Level, Anyway?","Calipatria, a desert town near California's Salton Sea, is 55 metres below sea level. The city is dry because no rivers are draining into the basin. The Earth isn't a sphere and gravity isn't quite the same everywhere on Earth's surface. Geographers spent a long time measuring Earth's gravity in the 20th century. The result is the Earth Gravitational Model, which is available on the internet and on your phone and GPS. The model was finished in 1996 and is available to this day on a web site that seems unchanged since 1996, but it's what we still put some trust in. It's also the standard for sea level rise, whether it's best-case centimetres or worst-case metres. But so are many things in the world, and I'd like to think we still trust in them. The next episode will be on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday, November 14. For more, visit CNN.com/science..

236,Why California's Musical Road Sounds Terrible,"If you drive down a certain stretch of highway in the California desert, you will hear music. It's supposed to sound a little bit like this:[William Tell Overture, by Rossini] But instead, it sounds like this. The musical road of Lancaster, California, is a publicity stunt for a car company. The problem was probably the English language. The higher the note, the greater the effect of that distortion. And the really strange part? This is the second musical road built in Lancaster. The first one, built by the car company, was too close to residents, who complained about the constant noise. So the city paved over it and rebuilt it...to the exact, same, wrong blueprints. That's a take. That is a take, I am indebted to David Simmons-Duffin, assistant professor of physics at Caltech, whose interests include Quantum Field Theories and playing baroque violin. He was, as far as I can tell, the very first person to figure out what went wrong. And in order to celebrate that take, he is going to put his foot down. He's going to say: ""I am going to take my foot down."" And he's going out on a limb here, too."
237,The Reaction Ferries of Basel: What Have We Missed?,"CNN's John Sutter travels to Basel, Switzerland, to learn about reaction ferries. Reaction ferries have no paddles, no oars, no engines, and nothing on board to power them. Sutter: In hindsight, they seem incredibly obvious, but to everyone else, it's an invention we've never thought of. The idea is to use the force of the river to push a boat across a river, rather than power it from a hydroelectric dam or other source of energy. ""It's a really obvious idea to anyone who grew up in a place with these ferries,"" Sutter says. ""But to everyone Else, it’s an invention that’ll change the world... just as soon as someone thinks of it"" ""I'm going to be honest with you: I don't know how you do it, but you do,"" says Sutter, ""because it's just so cool. It's like a miracle. It just makes you feel so good. And it's like, 'Oh, my God, I've done it!' "" ""What else have I missed?"" asks Sutter. ""What do you think? What's the next thing you're going to do?"" ""I've got a question for you, John."""
238,The Centuries-Old Debt That's Still Paying Interest,"In 1648, the Water Board of Lekdijk Bovendams in the Netherlands sold a bearer bond. Unlike modern bonds, they didn't set a time limit on that. The bond initially was for 1,000 carolus guilders, now it's worth €11.35 per year. The Dutch water authority could default on the debt if they wanted to. But for about one month a month, the bond gets a bit of publicity. It's worth more than the bond is worth to fly someone over every couple of decades. It might not be a subscription, but apparently, for them, it's a good track record. They sound like a triple-organisation to me, and I think we're going to be for a good while. I think they have a good record for a while, and that's good news for the world. I'm looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us next time we go to the Middle Ages, I'm sure they'll have a lot of new ideas about how to use the bond in the future. I've got a feeling they're not going to use it as much as they used to, though. I don't think they'll be as successful as I thought they would have been."
239,Rotary Jails and Accidental Amputations,"In 1881 an architect called William Brown and an iron foundry owner                called Benjamin Haugh patented an idea for a new type of jail. The Rotary Jail. In Crawfordsville, Indiana, the first one was built here in the 1880s. It's operated by a hand crank that moves bothfloors of the jail at exactly the same time. It works like a pin, all of the weight of it rests on the lip on the top of that pin. It weighs approximately 30 tonnes, it's made of steel. It hasn't held inmates for decades, but it is the only one where the mechanism still works. The moral of the story? Just because an idea has been patented doesn't mean that it's actually any good. It just means no one's thought of it before. And sometimes there's a reason for that. It was not a good idea, but that didn't stop them selling the idea to a few towns across the United States. The jail was shut down in 1938 because of fire concerns and with inmates getting limbs chopped off. It is still open to the public today, but there are no plans to open it to the general public. It has been closed for more than 20 years, and is still in use by local authorities."
240,How Computers Compress Text: Huffman Coding and Huffman Trees,"When you put English text into a computer, it is saving every individual character as eight bits of data. Images and video are different —that's lossy compression, where it doesn't matter if you lose a little bit of detail. But text has to be losslessly compressed:you can't just lose a bit of details. In 1952, a very clever mathematician called David Huffman invented coding. Huffman coding is the foundation of modern text compression. And there are much better ways to do this, modern, more complicated,mathematical ways to. do this. But first, we need to know how text is stored on disk before it's compressed. So, let’s run through how computers compress text. And here's how it works...let's say we want to compress ""Uncle Will's Wild Wild West"" into a stream of 1s and 0s. And let's say that we're not worried about speed, we just want to fit as much text as possible into as small a number of 1S and 0S as possible. And now, let's talk about how text compression works on a modern computer, and how we do it. Back to the page you came from. Click here to read the rest of the article."
