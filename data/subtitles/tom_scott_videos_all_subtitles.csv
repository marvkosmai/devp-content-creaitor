0,Keeping the world's longest railroad tunnel safe,"The Gotthard Base Tunnel is the longest and deepest rail tunnel in the world, 57 kilometers through the Alps. Literally, through. It's called a ""base tunnel"" because it's at the base of the mountain. At its deepest point, there are more than two kilometers of rock above. It's so far down into the ground that the earth in there is hot. Without ventilation, the air temperature will be more than 40Â°. Around the turn of the century, there were two devastating fires in road tunnels under those mountains, and the authorities here in Switzerland want to make sure that nothing like that can ever happen again. How they do that is fascinating. So here's what's going to happen. We're going to see the control center that watches over the tunnel, and also visit one of the intervention centers, with the firefighters and first responders that'll step in if the worst were to happen. And then I want to show you what I reckon is the most important bit of safety equipment. It isn't anywhere near the tunnel, and most people will probably never notice it. But before that, we start at the control center, just over there. In the Gotthard Base Tunnel, there are  six freight trains and two passenger trains, per hour, per direction. This means that at the same time, there are several trains inside the tunnel, in both of the two tubes. The Gotthard Base Tunnel is divided into three thirds. If there is a disturbance in one of these thirds, the train can be diverted at one of the two changement points, into the other tube, to bypass the disturbed section. There are different sections to control the traffic. The signal box controls the track. The movement authority is given by the signal box, and by the traffic controller. If there is a disturbance on one of the systems in the tunnel,  then we have different possibilities. First of all, we get noticed by an alarm that there is a problem. They first of all try to fix the problem remotely. If this is not successful, they can send people on site to try to fix it. This tunnel is actually a bit of a tourist attraction in itself. You can get driven in, down the service tunnel, on a guided tour, and end up at this reinforced, windproof, visitor's window with 8cm-thick glass, and watch the trains go by at anything up to 230km/h. That was terrifying! If a train has a technical problem, first of all the train driver tries to reboot the train system. If it's not successful, we have the firefighting train, which goes into the tunnel to tow out the broken train. In case of an incident in the tunnel, let's say a fire, we have two intervention centers, North and South. ""Intervention center"" means firefighting stations. They get an alarm, and within five minutes, usually both of the firefighting trains go into the tunnel from north and from south at the same time to fight the fire. They have the obligation to be on any point in the tunnel within 45 minutes. Firefighting train is a convoy of firefighting trucks on rail. They bring water in, foam liquid. They bring special equipment, tools, to handle any possible situation inside the tunnel. At the two emergency stops, there is a possibility to refill their water. If people have to be evacuated in the tunnel, they do not walk out of the tunnel because it's much too far. The train brings them to one of two evacuation stations, where the passengers can go into the evacuation tube. This evacuation tube is under pressure, so fresh air is streaming in. They are safe because they have enough oxygen, and smoke cannot enter. Then they go to the next evacuation section, where the evacuation train is waiting for them. We have to be able to evacuate the entire tunnel within 90 minutes. As I went round today, one of the team said that if there ever is an evacuation or a fire in the tunnel, several other things had to go wrong first. Yes, you can never protect against every possible weird circumstance, but you can try. Which brings me here, to what's basically the middle of nowhere in Switzerland, about 15km away from the south entrance to the tunnel, and to this gantry over the tracks. 15km sounds like a lot, but at the speed Swiss trains can travel, that could be about four or five minutes. And while it doesn't look like much, this gantry scans every train, at speed, before it even gets near the tunnel. There are sensors on the track around here too, and if the train has anything unbalanced, any hot spots that look out of place, anything poking out, then it's not going into the tunnel. We have laser systems which measure the profile of a train. Maybe the load of a train has moved, and doesn't respect any more the necessary profile to enter a tunnel. We have heat detection, where we can detect overheated axles or overheated brakes. All these controls, they happen at usual commercial speed of the trains, in different points, all over Switzerland, and we get about 200 alarms per day from these measuring stations. If we do not confirm an alarm within 30 seconds, the train is stopped automatically. It's not an emergency stop, it's... but it's quite... you feel it! If a train seems to be wrong, it gets to a side track where it has to wait. If the inspection says, this train is okay, then it can continue its journey, if not, the owner of the train has to resolve the problem before the train can continue its journey. Yes, there are lots of systems in place for if ""the worst happens"", but prevention is better than cure, and for me, this gantry is the most important bit of safety equipment here, because the best solution is to stop problems before they even start."
1,Why do YouTubers clap at the start of videos?,"To make it easy to sychronise the audio and video later. Except... that's not really an answer to the question, is it? If the question was ""why do YouTubers clap at the start of their recordings"", then yes, that's the answer, it's to help with synchronisation. A lot of the time, audio and video are being recorded separately. The microphone on my collar is sending its signal to a small and very beaten-up recorder that's clipped to my back pocket. The camera is recording its own sound too, and saving that as part of the video file on its memory card, [muffled, through camera mic] but it sounds terrbile. [back to main microphone] So when I'm working on the edit and putting the two files back together, it's really useful to have a short, loud, impulse sound at the start of both files, so I can synchronise them just by looking for the spike on the display. There's a couple of extra complications there, though. First of all: should that synchronisation be perfect? That camera is about two metres away from me. The speed of sound changes a little with temperature, but roughly, that's about 6 or 7 milliseconds. Not enough to care about here, but once you start putting the camera further away, ten or twenty metres for long shots... that sound can take a couple of frames to reach the camera and the audience. That would feel weird, so I'd have to slip the audio a little. That's why it's worth double-checking the synchronisation by looking for the frame of video where the hands touch. Plus, some cameras, particularly old GoPros, actually add some sound delay to the video file, their synchronisation is terrible. So if I've got three, or ten, or a hundred different cameras all looking at the same thing, I can use that clap to synchronise them all: get it close by looking for the spike, confirm it by looking at the hands. Actually, worst case, the audio can actually be late by up to... maybe three frames or so? And the chances are no-one will mind or even notice. Actually, the sound on this video has been three frames late ever since I cut back to this shot of me? If you did actually notice, well done, I'll put it back to normal now. I suspect that works because brains are used to correcting for small speed-of-sound lags for people shouting from a distance, but that's just speculation, I can't find research to back that up. And because the viewer might have things like a cheap external soundbar on a television that adds more lag, it's best to synchronise as close as you can. If the production's got a high budget, they might use a clapperboard instead. That means the editor has a record of which file is which take of which scene, at the start, and they can sync up the audio at the same time. But all that is still not an answer to the question. It's the answer everyone gives, but it's not what the title of this video is actually asking. This isn't ""why do YouTubers clap at the start of recordings"", it's ""why do YouTubers clap at the start of videos"". I've done that plenty of times before. I did it in this video. Why do we leave a bit of technical junk in the video? Why do I set up a really nice shot and then ruin it by showing the setup part, letting my camera fuzz about with autofocus, and make the whole video... worse? Well, I can't speak for everyone, but my reason is: it sets the audience's expectations, and it makes it feel more authentic. When I'm filming on my own with a static camera, it can sometimes look like I'm just stood against a green-screen. But clapping, walking into frame, letting the focus settle, showing that behind-the-scenes moment... it proves I'm here, it makes me seem more trustworthy. For someone vlogging from their bedroom, keeping those claps and the preparation in, letting the audience see a little bit of the slip-ups and how it's made... it helps make a connection, helps make them relatable. I don't need to be relatable. I don't really want to be relatable? But trustworthy. Trustworthy is good, and leaving the clap and walk in the video establishes that I'm one person with one camera, that I don't have a crew on this shoot, and that I am actually here, wherever here is. Sometimes I'll leave that in when I actually do have a crew. It's all about the aesthetics. Showing that setup, leaving that synchronisation clap in, it's all about fitting the message to the medium, planning not just what you want to say, but the subtext of how you say it, and handling all the subtle cues that connect performer to audience and say, it's okay. You can trust me."
2,This massive truck makes artificial earthquakes,"You know in the first Jurassic Park movie, there was that scene with the glass of water in the car's cupholder, with ripples on it to show just how heavy the approaching T-Rex's footsteps were? Well, this thing behind me is technically called the ""Large Mobile Shaker"", but the folks here at the University of Texas? They call it the ""T-Rex"", because it's a machine designed to shake the ground itself. We have five shakers. They go from a small one, that's right behind me. And we call that an ""urban shaker"" because you can bring it downtown and not get into trouble with shaking. And then we have very, very large ones, Liquidator and T-Rex. Liquidator is a low frequency vertical shaker where we generate surface waves. Like surface waves from earthquakes, but ours are linear, typically, and earthquakes can be non-linear. [loud vibration with descending tone] T Rex is a tri-axial shaker. Tri-axial means that the shaker, only one at a time, it can shake vertically, it can shake horizontally, and it can go transverse. It can go up to about 60,000 pounds force vertically, and about half horizontally. We have been all over the United States. We have sensors that we've designed and we will push in because there are pushing rams on the back of Liquidator and T-Rex, so that we can install sensors and then watch the wave go down. Many times we're watching the wave propagate away from us, but other times it's very helpful to watch the wave going down, and seeing how poorly the soil might behave due to large amplitude shaking, which is what you don't want. We just came back from Wyoming, where they're going to build new power plants, and the earthquake design is critical. And we generated a 6000-foot-long wave. Now we generated a two foot long wave, too, but going through the range. So that means we could evaluate the stiffness profile down to half a mile. With no boreholes! That is really a true accomplishment and a very, very cost effective addition to the design of the plant. So this is a sensor. It's a big magnet with a coil. The coil is going through the magnetic field. We were out there in Wyoming and the darn cows walked by. Fortunately, they didn't break any cables, but we had to stop testing because they made more noise. They were right out there and we were half a mile away. Oh, my goodness. Every time we go someplace, we'll make sure the level won't damage structures. Once we were on the UCLA campus, and maybe didn't watch what we were doing so much, and people came running out of the building. And that got us in trouble!"
3,How the US Postal Service reads terrible handwriting,"Almost all the letters that get sent in the United States are processed automatically. You put a letter in a post box, it's taken to the closest processing center, where cameras and computers take a picture of the front of the envelope, read the address with optical character recognition, OCR, and it's then passed on to the right truck or plane. That deals with pretty much everything, even the handwritten letters. But what if your handwriting is really bad? Like, really bad. Or the envelope got a bit damp, and the ink blurred and ran? The postal service sends the picture of the envelope here to the Remote Encoding Center, the REC, in Salt Lake City, Utah, and it's the job of the folks here to turn scrawl and blurred ink  into actual addresses. It's a quiet day here today. Mail volumes are low in the middle of summer. So while it's not busy inside, I'm going to see if I'd be any good at this. We're in the last Remote Encoding Center in the United States. Back in 1997, when we had 55 RECs open, all of those RECs combined keyed 19 billion images. The OCR technology is so good that, in 2021, as the last REC remaining, we only keyed 1.2 billion images. Right now, we have about 810 employees here. Shortly, we're going to be teaching Tom how to process some of this mail. It'll be a lot of fun. It's important to say that I can't show you any actual mail, not the envelopes, not anything. If any appears in the background on a screen, it'll be blurred out. That's all considered strictly private. And besides, I'm not going to flash random people's addresses on the screen of a YouTube video, particularly when they'll usually be written in distinctive handwriting? You can probably work out how that could go wrong. But there is a stack of demonstration mail, envelopes and addresses used for training, and that's what I'm going to be tested on. If you drop off a piece of mail, it makes it to the local processing plant. If the machine can't read your handwriting, one of the keyers here will type in the missing information, and the information goes right back to the plant, stays within automation, which is a whole lot cheaper than having somebody physically sort that piece by hand. All right, what do I need to do? Put your last name and first initial into that. I looked at the keyboard to look for the numbers and realized this is aThat is not a standard keyboard! That is not a standard keyboard. Other than the QWERTY letters and the numpad, everything is different. Okay. To make everything faster for us, they did some weird things with the keyboards that they've provided us. The home row, A, S, D, F, those also work as your numbers. You can't reach up to the top of the keyboard to hit 1, 2, 3. ""How to key the outward portion of a mailpiece image."" We're calling outward the city and the state. City and the state, okay. Siemens came up with this in the '90s. So they decided ""C coding"" is going to mean zip code. Outward is going to mean city and state. Inward is going to mean the street address. And that's now the language that you use, because that's what they decided. To make it faster to key these letters, our keying is a small extract of what's on the letter, and then it compares it to the known-good addresses in the database. Every known-good address in America is sitting on our servers in the back. If it's good, the piece just goes away, and you're done. If it matches a couple of good addresses, then you'll get a list and you'll choose out of that list, which is the address you were trying for. It makes it a whole lot faster than typing out the entire things. ""Key in the first three characters of the first word in the city name."" Okay, first character of the second word. Two character state or territory of abbreviation. It's the 3+1 rule. It's the same for the street addresses. Okay. ""Press the Go key when ready."" Go. So that is LE TMS. Oh. 3+1 rule. If there's not three characters, you got to do a space. Ah, okay. Now, you've got to clear it out with the Enter key. So that is LE, space, TMS. C/S key. C/S, oh, ""city/state"". Got it, okay. Some pieces are buffered and some pieces are live. That live mail will be sitting on a conveyor belt, going around the machine. Those flats and those packages, if we don't key them in 90 seconds and get the information back to that machine, it dumps it off into a reject bin and somebody has to hand sort that. So for the letters, they run them through the machine one time, they store them off to the side. A few hours later, they put them in the machine the second time, anticipating that we've processed everything that was missing. Oh. I'm guessing that's, like... ""Dixon Hill""? Or something like that. I can't tell if that's DIC or DX... Unless it was... Ox Hill! It's Ox Hill. Okay. Oh. Remember, these are the easiest ones to read on the test. I realized that. Get ready. Every year, we have fewer and fewer pieces. We've got fewer people handwriting mail, and we have OCR technology that's really good. I'll bet we went from somewhere in the neighborhood of less than half of the mail being read by a computer in the '90s to nearly 99% of letters being read today. The OCRs that are reading the letter mail, I think it's close to 99%. So we get the 1% of the junk, and we improve about half of that 1%. Right. The job here may be getting harder because pieces are harder to read. Because if the computer is so good and can't read it, it's a lot more likely, it's not a good piece of mail to begin with. The address was destroyed somehow, or the customer had bad information for the address. So they've put ""Ft"" Lauderdale in the abbreviation. So I would put F-T, no matter what? Not F-O-R? I don't autocorrect that. Correct. Do it how the customer did it. We're not sleuths. We're not picking out details. You key by the rules, you type in the address information from what you can clearly see. Now, the street address works similarly, where you'll do all the numbers, and then 3+1. ""Ignore the direction word and key the street name. ""If the direction word is the only word, key it."" Okay. 3+1 rule. So, Go. All right. Ah, the... I looked down to find where the numbers are! 720WES, no, yeah, that's West Boulevard. So you include that and you hit Street. 400 Little Way Street. We have internet service from three different providers. We have three fiber optic lines coming into the building at different points. So if any one point gets chopped off, we can maintain service, because we're the only REC, connected to every plant in the country, over 300 processing plants, including Guam and Anchorage, Alaska; and Juneau, Alaska; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It's asking for numeric, and it's in C coding, so it wants the zip code. It wants the zip code, 35804, go. So if both the machine can't read it and a keyer isn't able to decipher it here, the machine at the plant sends it to the reject bin, and then somebody will manually handle it. And then, if they can't figure it out, it would either get returned to the sender. And if there's no return-to-sender information, then it will go to the Mail Recovery Center. Okay, final test. Here we go. Numeric. We don't have a numeric. So we hit None. Correct. Then, it's outward, which is MOK, space, HI, C/S, 2545HEAD... Street. Nice. Okay. I mean, what speed would I have to go here? 7,150 keystrokes per hour. It's the speed with which you have to read that, parse it... It's much tougher than I thought it was going to be to keep everything in your head. And this is easy handwriting. Nothing here has been blurred. And you haven't even gotten to the ones that are upside down or backwards, right, or packages that have four sides to them. And it would be an average of four seconds for each one to keep up the pace. On average, it's about four seconds that somebody's got one of these on their screen. Wow. And you did an incredible job for just learning these rules right now. I'm impressed. All right, thank you. I'll take that! Thank you so much."
4,"This clock was famous, but the internet ruined it.","Normally, when Iâm filming somewhere like this, I try and set the camera so it's got that kind-of professional, depth-of-field... you know the shot, everything in the background is blurred. But there's a windmill back there, and I really want that in focus. I had to throw out nearly all my script for this video. Normally, when I go and film somewhere, I try and write everything in advance. I research things in detail before I get there, when I arrive somewhere there should be no surprises. But I knew, even as I set up for filming on the roof of Royal FloraHolland, that perhaps this video wasn't going to go to plan. Good morning, it's just after sunrise here in Aalsmeer, in the Netherlands. This is one of the largest commercial buildings in the world, and today, just like every weekday, millions of fresh flowers are being bought and sold inside. Sort of. This market has existed is some form for a hundred years, and recently there have been some changes. Because here's how the story's supposed to go: the auction room will be full of buyers, frantically pushing buttons to bid as cart after cart after cart after cart after cart of fresh flowers are paraded in front of them in a massive, perfectly-timed logistics operation. But Iâm not sure that happens any more. All the English-language sources I found are out of date, because things are changing at the Dutch flower market. It turns out a lot of the Dutch-language sources are out of date too. The truth is that a famous decades-old tradition has ended, in the same way that video-rental stores gave way to streaming. A thing that tourists came to see, and that a lot of people think still happensâ¦ is no more. So Iâm going to update the English-speaking world: the famous Dutch Flower Auction Clock is no more. But the flower market that it was once part of is still there, and it runs on an almost incomprehensible scale. IN DUTCH:       Efficiency. Weâll come back to that shortly. I often complain that the camera doesnât capture the scale of something that I visit, but in this case, itâs not just the camera: itâs that there are no good sightlines anywhere in that warehouse. Itâs next to the airport, so I canât get drone shots. And itâs not that tall, so thereâs no one point where you can overlook the whole thing. Look, itâs so big that the employees sometimes use bikes inside to get from one end to the other. Itâs a giant, high-speed, hyper-optimised clearing-house: growers deliver flowers in the early morning, and by lunchtime theyâre sold and on their way to buyers, either via the warehouses next door or in trucks that ship them onwards. So okay, itâs a logistics warehouse. The scale is impressive but itâs nothing too special. The famous part is how the flowers are sold there. If youâve heard of a Dutch auction? This is one of those auctions, I think the biggest one anywhere. Thereâs lots of historical footage of the big auction clock, it used to be analog and then went digital. Hundreds of flower buyers all sat in theatre seating as racks of flowers are paraded in front of them. For each lot of flowers, the clock counts from a high price to a low price. First to press their button stops the clock and pays whatever itâs showing. Press too late, someone else gets the flowers. Press too early, youâve paid too much. It's an amazing system, it looks great on camera, itâs been covered by loads of media over the years. Andâ¦ itâs gone. I thought the pandemic would have caused some changes, butâ¦ no, it turns out this all changed years ago. The internet enabled remote buying, so the theatre seating got emptier and emptier over the years. Thereâs now a reputation system for the sellers, so buyers could know the quality was as advertised without actually inspecting the flowers in person. By the mid-2010s, those racks of flowers werenât being pushed through the auction rooms, and by the end of the decade, the rooms were closed down. I got shown one of them, it looked abandoned and actually a little bit sad. The replacement is many auctioneers running many clocks, over the internet, all at the same time, sitting in cubicles with microphones. The flower auction isnât like some old railway that gets kept alive as a tourist attraction, or preserved by a group of volunteers running what's basically a reenactment society. It turns over billions of euros every year, and if tradition gets in the way of that, then tradition has to go. And I think the sources arenât up to date because âthis famous thing has slowly been replacedâ isnât a nice friendly story. And besides that: 60% of what goes that warehouse is sold in advance by contract now, bypassing the clocks entirely. Some of the really large buyers, like international supermarket chains, are making private arrangements with sellers who donât use the warehouse, because those chains are big enough that they can handle the logistics themselves and that saves money. The tourists do still visit. The scale there is still impressive, and I think itâs still worth going to see if youâve got some spare time near Amsterdam. But if you were hoping to watch the famous Dutch Auction Clock, well, these days itâs a lesson to anyone who thinks that they wonât need to change with the times. In the business world, tradition is rarely more important than money. And speaking of money, todayâs video is sponsored by NordVPN. Seriously, it actually is! Iâm a little bit surprised too. I'm on the road a lot at the moment, #and it turns out that having a magic button that tells web sites and phone apps that I'm in my home country is really useful. Without a VPN, lots of sites that Iâm visiting keep putting everything in Dutch and giving me prices in Euros. Sometimes there's not even an option to change that. Even YouTube's sometimes like, ""oh, ik zal je nooit opgevenâ. Last week, I was blocked from accessing a UK government site until I turned on the VPN. And also, when I'm researching, sometimes I find American sites that completely block me because I'm in Europe and they can't be bothered to comply with European privacy laws. But now, I can click a button and tell those sites ""nope, I'm in any one of sixty countries now, let me in"" and it's actually, properly useful to me. If you want streaming services to show you content from other countries, that's an option too, just check the serviceâs terms and conditions first. If you go to nordvpn.com/tomscott, you'll find the best deal that they're currently offering, and there's a 30-day money back guarantee. So if itâs not right for you, nothing lost. I am kinda surprised to be endorsing NordVPN this enthusiastically, and saying ""it works for me and I find it useful"", but: it is and I do. So Iâm okay with taking their money and breaking with tradition. That's nordvpn.com/tomscott."
5,The massive Fatigue Carousel helps keep roads safe,"If some big industrial company or research lab wants to prototype a new road surface or road building method, how do they test that for the long term? Roads need to last decades. How do they simulate hundreds of thousands of vehicles rolling over their new road for years, without actually doing that? The answer is something called an ""accelerated pavement testing facility"". And there's only a few in the world. This is one of the largest. It was built in 1984. It's in the west of France. And it's better known as the fatigue carousel. The fatigue carousel consists of a central tower, with hydraulic motors which run the machine. And then it has four arms, and outer wheels which load the pavements. A ring is 120 metres in length. And the test section is six metre wide. So this machine allows to simulate, in a few months, 10 or 20 years of traffic on the real road. For a long period, the machine was used to validate French pavement materials. And now we are trying to find new applications. Recently, we had a test with bio-binders, to replace bitumen, because petroleum will, in some time, disappear. And now there is also a lot of interest, for charging electric vehicles by the road. [machine hums] You can tell how heavy those arms are, by how much those tyres squash at the bottom. Oh-[machine noise, increasing in pitch] It's a good noise. The tests are done with the outer wheels, at loads corresponding to heavy vehicles. But we can also install on each arm, single wheels, dual wheels or also two axles or three axles. When the machine runs, we can also move the wheels laterally, to reproduce the effect of real traffic. And you can also change the loads. On a single axle, we can go from 4.5 tonnes to about 8.5 tonnes. So sometimes we can overload the pavement, to accelerate deterioration. It takes a few minutes to creep up to speed. And it's kind of a little bit unnerving standing here. Because, it started off as, ""oh, it's very slow. oh, this is all very safe."" And now it's-now there's a lot of metal coming towards me! Faster and faster. This machine can run at about 100km/h. The usual testing speed is 70km/h, because we don't want to go to the maximum, but we can go to 100km/h. I thought this was up to speed. And I think it's still getting faster. I've got dust in my eye from the wind. Ah! We instrument, usually, the soil and also the pavement layers. So in the soil we put, generally, our displacement transducers, our vertical strain transducers, to measure the vertical displacement. And then in the bituminous layers, the most common instrumentation is strain gauges. We use, also temperature sensors, because temperature variation is very important, for the pavement response. And we use, also, accelerometers or geophones, to measure the vertical acceleration, and then to get the vertical displacement. Testing on this carousel doesn't mean just for a few hours or a few days. A test here can last months, the carousel constantly rotating, with the wheels travelling at anything up to 100km/h, with a thousand-horsepower engine powering them, so that years' worth of pavement stress and road damage can be built up in weeks. There are actually three different circular test tracks here, and the carousel can be taken apart and moved between them. That way, while a test is happening over here for a few weeks, another track can be torn up and rebuilt for the next set of experiments. And the tracks can be divided into sections, to run several different tests at once. One of the tracks is also watertight, for testing how pavements behave on wet or soaked ground. And I really hope that the size and scale of this thing is coming across on camera, because I've had to change my microphone to the windproof one, because of how much turbulent air this thing generates. Those arms are twice my height. They are massive. It is genuinely unnerving to be standing here, not able to see this with just this noise behind me. There are some limitations, of course, because it's an accelerated test. We cannot control the climate conditions. And then there is ageing of the bituminous materials. They become more brittle. And obviously we cannot simulate that, because we have to do the test in several months. We include one reference section with a material that we know. We can make a comparison with a classical material, and correct the results by some coefficients, to adapt to real conditions. It's tempting to think that in the 21st century, we can test everything by computer modelling and simulation. But those simulations have to be grounded in truth somewhere. You can't build those models without real-world data. And when you're dealing with public safety and billion-euro infrastructure projects, sometimes there is no substitute for just building something real. [carousel whirring]"
6,How does Britain know what time it is?,"If you buy a clock like this, one that says ""radio controlled"", you just put a battery in, and it sets itself to the correct time. And it stays there, automatically, for a year or more. So it can't be receiving signals from satellites, there's no wifi connection, there's nowhere near enough power in here for that. Instead, it uses much older technology. Here at the radio transmission station in Anthorn, the National Physical Laboratory, NPL, broadcasts a time signal to the UK in a simple enough format that the cheap electronics inside this clock can understand it, and run accurately for over a year on a single double-A battery. And at NPL's base in London, I asked their team how it all works. What we have in Anthorn are some very high-end cesium atomic clocks, like the ones we have down here. We broadcast from there, we monitor the signals at NPL and accordingly put out steers to those clocks to correct for any any change. It's a very low frequency, 60 kilohertz, it has very low susceptibility to atmospheric effects. We steer from NPL based on measuring what Anthorn is broadcasting at the level of nanoseconds. That is a nanosecond, the distance light travels in one nanosecond, 30 centimeters. All that is taken into account. So that seemed simple enough. The official timescale is kept in London. I wasn't allowed anywhere near the official atomic clocks, I don't even know if they're actually at NPL's headquarters or not, they might be somewhere else. They told me nothing! But up north here, this transmitter has separate atomic clocks, about four hundred kilometres away from the base. Or 1.4 light-milli-seconds away. There's a light-speed delay, a latency, of about a thousandth of a second between the transmitter here and the base in London. Because the team at NPL know exactly what that delay should be, they can issue corrections if these clocks start to drift, even by nanoseconds, billionths of seconds. Officially, the accuracy is much lower than that, of course, partly because they keep a very wide safety margin, and partly because I can introduce a one-nanosecond drift to this clock by doing that. What is really important when you're transferring time is not about the latency, but understanding the latency. So you can take that out of the equation. From the NPL, we disseminate to the UK over radio broadcast. Essentially that offers the entire UK mainland several milliseconds of traceability to UTC. We also have a fibre-delivered service for regulatory compliance in the finance sector, guaranteed at the microsecond. And that's fine, I can understand all that. But then that leads to another question: how does NPL know if their clocks in London start to drift? Sure, they've got many of them, they cross-check, and a ""second"" in the 21st century is defined by the number of vibrations of a cesium atom. But still, they can't be perfect. They're meant to show the international standad, UTC, coordinated universal time, so what if NPL's official source of timekeeping truth drifts from that standard? UTC or coordinated universal time, as the name suggests, is coordinated globally, contributing data from multiple atomic clocks to generate what is the global timescale, UTC. What we have here at NPL is the UK's timescale, UTC(NPL). We have a whole suite of atomic clocks, cesium clocks, hydrogen masers, and a cesium fountain. The Bureau of Weights and Measures based in France take the data from the clocks around the globe, and inform each of the national labs how offset it is from UTC. And that's where the buck stops. In Paris. Unless you start getting into physics and relativity and light cones, and that's way beyond me. Why does it matter? Well, first of all, finance and high-frequency trading. But also: science. Things like the Square Kilometre Array, a planet-wide array of radio telescopes that's being planned and built now. When they're listening for incredibly faint radio waves from space, all the telescopes around the globe have to be synchronised with that level of precision, or the whole experiment could fall apart. So then, I had a final question: when accurate timecode is being sent from so many places, when the public can get time that's more than accurate enough for almost every purpose from navigation satellites in space: why is this signal still important? And the team from NPL had a rather serious answer. Time really is an invisible utility. It underpins our digital infrastructure, whether it's the synchronization of the energy grid, or the telecom networks, or finance. We are so dependent on GPS and other constellations. One of the problems we face is those signals are easily disrupted. It's the equivalent of a light bulb on the moon. One of the things we're doing at the NPL is to ensure that the UK is resilient for the future. Standing by the ocean with a domestic appliance. The weird thing is, it's not the first time."
7,Reopening an airport terminal is harder than you might think,"This Sunday, the South Terminal at London's Gatwick Airport will reopen to the public after nearly two years closed. And I figured that reopening would just be a case of the team here turning the lights back on, dusting off some equipment, and getting back to business. But from talking to the folks who are getting everything ready, it turns out that mothballing an entire airport terminal for 18 months and then reopening it again is much more difficult than you might think. In March 2020 when the pandemic struck, we obviously realized there was going to be a significant downturn in traffic. So we took the decision to close one of our terminals. Gatwick Airport would generally see upwards of 900 movements off of our runway on a busy summer day. During the height of the pandemic, we were down to two or three flights a day with certainly less than 500 passengers on certain days. I think it's fair to say, in March 2020 we all thought it'd be over in two weeks' time. If the terminal had been shut down for just a week, or maybe a month, then yes, things would probably have just kept ticking over. But there's some point at which upkeep is required. In the same way that you're not meant to leave a car sitting unused for more than a couple of weeks, the mechanical parts in things like the baggage belts and jetbridges need to be run, tested, and maintained regularly, or they might not start up ever again. Closing the terminal does reduce costs, yes, but it doesn't make them zero. There's a number of core services we've had to keep running. We had to do regular maintenance and safety checks on all of our passenger boarding bridges and airfield equipment. Water systems, lighting systems, power, fire, life safety systems, everything that's there to look after the people and keep everyone safe. But things like, you know, heating and lighting in various areas nd power for escalators and lifts, they were all shut down. Mainly to save money during the crisis, we had to make cuts wherever possible. We've been taking the opportunity to use the space for filming. Film companies have been coming in and doing various shows around the airport. Some of which, I think, will be airing in the next few weeks. A large number of our workforce had been furloughed, and since the 1st of October, we've had everyone back in to get the airport back up and running. Now as passenger numbers start to grow, we are actively recruiting and we need to increase our workforce by a significant number. We're reopening 85% of it straight away. We've got a phased plan for our airlines moving back over from North Terminal over three days, but all the infrastructure will come online more or less from day one. In terms of a challenge? Yeah, it's the biggest one I've done at Gatwick airport. It's been open for 60-odd years, that's now been closed for the best part of two years. You know, buildings don't react too well to that sort of thing. The scale of what we're doing here is... we've often likened it to opening a smaller airport, completely from scratch. It is a huge task that we're undertaking. I'm feeling really confident, actually. I think we're in a really good place to do it. The first flight from the South Terminal is scheduled to leave on Sunday in the early hours of the morning. So it'll probably be about 3am when the first passengers go through the doors. And they probably won't know or care that the terminal's only just opened again: they'll just want to get to their destination. If everything goes to plan, they probably won't even know that the terminal was ever closed."
8,The top secret plan to explode a nuclear bomb in Yorkshire,"A few weeks ago, I was looking through records in the British National Archives for a separate video idea that didn't end up going anywhere, but while I was researching I found a completely different report, secret and restricted when it was written but now unclassified, and it's the first time in a long while that I've read some old archive file and my jaw has literally dropped. It was called: ""Possible Sites for Completely Contained Nuclear Explosions in North Yorkshire."" North Yorkshire is a beautiful area that includes two national parks. This is the middle of one of them. It is stunning, it is historic, it is not somewhere that I'd expect anyone to try and set off a nuclear explosion. The report was written in June 1969, so just for context, we're talking full Space Race, white-heat-of-technology era. Neil Armstrong would set foot on the moon only about a month after that report was written. And the report is talking about Peaceful Nuclear Explosions. Which was an idea that was in fashion among some nuclear scientists and policy makers at the time. Maybe, the theory went, we could create artificial harbours and canals using nuclear bombs. No more years of mechanical digging, just put a few well-placed nukes in the ground and, boom, boom, boom, there's your new canal. Or maybe we could help stimulate production in gas wells, basically nuclear fracking. Or, and this was charitably the most practical idea, create enormous underground cavities for gas storage, instead of having to use big above-ground tanks. The US did run a couple of dozen nuclear tests like that under the rather Biblical title ""Operation Plowshare"". The Soviet Union eventually ran more than 200. But those are stories that have already been told by a lot of other people. By the 1970s, the US and the Soviets would work out that it was a bad idea: if you use a nuke, either for fracking, or to create underground gas storage, the radiation ends up contaminating the gas. But until that was figured out... well, I don't think many people have actually noticed the records about it since it was declassified, but it turns out at least some people in the UK were interested as well. Those people worked at the Gas Council, and the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, and the report shows that they were seriously trying to work out if nuclear bomb gas storage caverns were a good idea. I kept researching, and found they'd commissioned a full study, laying out the pros and cons, comparing the cost to other methods of storage. They had picked a site. Which was here. Actually, literally, exactly there, bottom of that ravine. Wheeldale, in the middle of the North Yorkshire Moors National Park. The plan was: buy all the land for about a mile around. Drill down 2,000 feet, about 600 metres, with a special extra-wide drill bit, big enough so they could drop a 25 kiloton nuclear bomb down to the bottom of the hole. I say ""drop"". Lower. That's a big enough bomb to annihiliate a city in the open air. Plug up the hole, cover the top so nothing comes out, hopefully. Evacuate the thousand or so people who live nearby, just in case. And then... boom. Not much would happen on the surface. There'd be a bit of a jolt and a rumble, a few birds startled into the air. The local towns of Pickering and Whitby, about ten miles away each, they'd feel a minor earthquake, and maybe a couple of buildings would get a few small cracks in them. I'm not kidding, that's what the report actually says, it just phrases it a little bit more delicately than that. It's not clear whether the locals would actually have been told what was going on, but I think it would have been impossible to hide. After that, they would let the giant cavern that had been created 600 metres down cool for a few months, and then flush out and remove most of the radioactive stuff that was left behind, which it turns out would have been a lot more difficult than they thought at the time. Finally, they'd put some pumping equipment in here at the top, and presto, giant underground high-pressure gas storage tank for relatively not much money. And after a couple of years, they can sell most of this land back. Cost of the explosion, in today's money, adjusted for inflation: about nine million pounds. Which is... not actually bad for a giant gas storage tank? I suspect that was a very optimistic estimate, though. Even that was more expensive than setting up liquid natural gas storage above ground, but once you've the made the cavern, it's much cheaper to run this way. If, that is the explosion works as predicted. And if there's really no radiation left over. There were a lot of risks. Now, as far as I can tell, this never got anywhere near the Prime Minister's desk, there was never some high-up government meeting trying to work out whether they should nuke a bit of a national park. I suspect it would have been a very bad political decision. And a very bad environmental decision. And a very bad financial decision. And... look, I'm sure there is some possible alternate history where this happened, but things would need to have been very different. The last reference I could find is from November 1969. The plan was worked out in theory, and the minutes of the meeting from then say that ""further thought would be given to what action should follow"". And at some point, in some other record that I missed, or maybe that is still restricted, I'm sure there'll be a note that says they decided not to pursue the idea. Peaceful nuclear explosions would eventually be banned by treaty, conveniently just after the point at which the US and Russia found out they weren't a great idea. And the North Yorkshire Moors, thankfully, were never nuked."
9,"There's a Â£100,000 coin buried under this London building","I'm not saying this is definitely a plot for a British Ocean's-11 style heist caper, but if there are any screenwriters out there watching this: I feel like this one might be for you. British coins have the year that they were manufactured right on them. So if you're a coin collector, and your dream is the full set, it's not just a case of finding one of each design: you also want each value from each year. But in 1933, Britain didn't need any more pennies. There were plenty in circulation, so the Royal Mint, who make or ""mint"" coins, decided they wouldn't make any one-pence coins that year. That's not unusual, it had happened before. Trouble is, King George V needed some. It was tradition for the King to bury a full set of new coins from that year in the foundations of new and important buildings as they were constructed, and you couldn't use old coins for that. So the Royal Mint did make some 1933 pennies. No-one actually kept the records of how many there were, but it was probably... seven. Which means that while the face value of those seven coins is a penny, they're so rare that the price at auction these days is easily more than Â£100,000. And over at a London coin dealership, I got to see one of them. This is from a private collection, one that's been loaned to us very kindly. It's great because it's such an iconic coin, we get a lot of visitors coming to see it. Usually these coins disappear into safes and they're never seen again. The last sold in 2016 for a hammer price of around Â£140,000. It's the first time one's been sold for many, many years and one would imagine, if it was to come on the market again, it would sell for even higher. So there are probably seven 1933 pennies. Three are in private collections I got to film one of those.  Â  Two are in museums. And the others...  Â  ...well, that's the possible heist movie. Because remember, the king buried some of the coins. One of them was buried under this church in Middleton, West Yorkshire. I say ""was"" because in 1970, it was stolen. Whereabouts still unknown, although presumably if someone in Yorkshire finds a 1933 penny in their grandparents' coin collection, there'll be a bit of suspicion. And after this theft... ...the local bishop ordered that the coins under this church should be dug up and sold in order to prevent them falling into the hands of thieves. That's one of the pennies that's in private hands legally now. Which means there is one building and one buried coin left. The last 1933 penny is buried somewhere under the foundations of Senate House, at the University of London. Or at least, everyone thinks it is. No-one's checked since 1933, you'd have to dig it up. And I doubt anyone actually knows exactly where it's buried, unless they've done a huge amount of research and found some original blueprints. Which, to be clear, I haven't. And besides, according to the university, the whole package is buried very deep, not exactly where you'd expect, which does sound like what someone would write if they were trying to discourage amateur treasure-hunting thieves. But Senate House is right here, in the middle of London. There is some construction around here today, a few people in high-viz jackets with power tools. And while it's not exactly cracking the vault of a Las Vegas casino... well, I don't have a plan for you. And I don't recommend anyone try it for real. But it is a heist movie waiting to happen. Seriously, don't try it. This isn't the movies. It's... it's just a coin. I don't have any plans to... How do I make this sound not sarcastic?"
10,The hidden background noise that can catch criminals,"The alternating current running through these power lines changes direction constantly. A full cycle back and forth, 50 times a second. 60 in some of the parts of the world, but here in Europe, 50 times a second. But that transmission isn't perfectly efficient.  There are imperfections and stray electromagnetic fields. And a little bit of that power  becomes vibration, which makes sound at that frequency of 50 hertz. Or 100, or other multiples of 50. That's the ""mains hum"" you can sometimes hear coming from power lines, or maybe from speakers that aren't quite plugged in properly. Also, that hum isn't exactly 50 cycles a second. The grid frequency shifts slightly and constantly over time as the engineers in charge balance supply and demand. It's only a tiny fraction of a shift, but it's there. The whole grid runs at the same, slightly wobbling, almost-50 hertz, no matter where you are.  That mains hum can be really annoying for people recording audio. You can hear it in the background sometimes.  But if you were to log what that wobbling grid frequency was, every second of every day, keep all that in a database, and then compare it to recordings with mains hum on them, then in theory, you'd have a perfect watermark to prove the time when anything was recorded. I talked to one of the forensic experts who works with it, and also set them a challenge.  Historically, what's had to happen is: we've had to record the grid frequency data ourselves by literally plugging a recording device into the mains. The National Grid have recently released their data, seven years recorded right at the source. It's fairly simple, actually, signal processing. You're looking to see if there is a component around 50 hertz or one of the harmonics. I would hesitate against advising anyone to present themselves to court as a forensic expert,  but this type of evidence has been used in court to date recordings. The longer recording you have, the better.  As an absolute minimum, I think about a minute. If it's a noisy recording, or if the ENF isn't particularly clear, then the longer recording you have, the better.  So: find the mains hum frequency in the footage and then write code to match against the millions of possibilities in the National Grid logs. Does it work?  Well to find out, I asked some friends of mine  who make videos to send me over some of their raw footage. Straight out of a camera, unprocessed, unfiltered. And I asked the forensic team: can you timestamp it? First up, footage from Taha,  one of the team behind educational channel Answer in Progress. There's a quite strong component here, and you can see it's got a bit of a wobble. We use a signal processing algorithm to extract the peak, and we constrain the algorithm so that it can't suddenly jump up here. So even if there is a higher amplitude, something up here, it will stick to this curve. Then compare. If we know that  a recording was taken on a certain day, then we just need to give it a day's worth of National Grid data. If we're not sure when it was taken, we'll throw everything at it, and it will take a bit longer to process, but it's not prohibitive. Spot on. Got it to the second.  Although it's important to say that the team never said they were certain about the timing, only that they had a very high chance of being correct. And yes, they were.  Next up, footage from Hannah Witton, sex and relationships educator. There wasn't a component at around 50 hertz. So here we have the axis, 49 hertz to 50 hertz, and we can see no apparent ENF trace. So I'm going to change the axes up to around 100. And then we'll be able to see the harmonic component around 100 hertz. Because it's quite strong and seems to be behaving in a way that we'd expect ENF to behave, we can be fairly confident that this is an ENF harmonic. What's interesting about this one is: it  sort of appears halfway through the recording. Maybe there's a little bit of something earlier on, but... So there's a possibility that maybe Hannah was moving around when she made this recording, getting closer or further away from mains powered equipment.  Maybe the mains hum was coming from something on a timer or a thermostat in the background that just switched, but the timestamp was accurate. So the next test was Steve Mold from his science channel. And I thought that this one would be easy because he sent B-roll. He's not talking, it's just ambient noise. And also: he's holding a fan that's plugged into the mains! There's no strong component at all for ENF. So the next step would be to look at the other frequency regions to see if we can identify any harmonics. How loud the person is often doesn't have much of an effect. It's often environmental noise, that would be lower to mask ENF. There is possibly something here, but because we haven't got a strong trace, it's sort-of  fading in and out, we wouldn't be confident to use this for ENF analysis. Sometimes it just doesn't work.  As a last test,  I sent over some of my old footage from when I was filming  against green screen in my tiny flat last year.  I was sneaky, though, and it hid an edit in there. What could happen with an edit is: you have a sudden jump in ENF frequency. In that case, it's quite likely to be an edit.  It's possible that the ENF trace would just sort of stop. The reason for that could be  because it's got an edit in, which in this case we believe it has, but could also be because you walked away from the source of the ENF energy. Like any forensic analysis, this isn't some magic tool that always works. Compression can stop it working.  You need minutes of uninterrupted audio to have enough confidence in the result. And sometimes there might be no background mains hum at all. But I love this because it's an accident of technology that's created a tool that would sound like science fiction 20 years ago."
11,The world's most expensive object by weight,"It's a stamp.  I did have a couple of paragraphs of lead up to that, but honestly, if you're just here to find out what the most expensive object in the world by weight is, it's this stamp. There's now going to be several diversions about why it should count as that, what the alternatives might be, and why it's that expensive. But if you just clicked the video  to find out the answer to the question in the title, it's this stamp. $8.3 million for about 40 milligrams. The stamp's called the British Guiana one cent magenta. It's the absolute pinnacle of rarity in stamp collecting. It's not a variant.  It's not a watermark variety. It's not a printing error. It's a straight, normal postage stamp of which only one survived, and that's what makes it unique.  So this was actually produced  at the local printer office, so it was only ever intended to tide the colony over for a week or two. This one-cent stamp also, it's believed, only paid a newspaper rate, which meant that they were used just to post newspapers locally, and newspapers, even back then, were immediately disposable. There may be more expensive stuff by weight. Antimatter is often called the most expensive stuff in the world, but I don't think that should count here for several reasons. First, there's no way for anyone, no matter how wealthy they are, to buy a gram of antimatter in the shops or at auction. Second, substances aren't objects. The English language has a distinction between ""count nouns"" and ""mass nouns"". It's the difference between  ""there was a dog on the road"" and ""there was dog on the road"". There's probably a less gruesome way of explaining that,  but I guarantee that's going to stay in more people's heads. And the third reason: this stamp is non-fungible. Even if there was an antimatter shop just down the road... okay, let's let's go for something more realistic, but also very expensive. Let's say there's a shop selling printer ink just down the road. One gram of printer ink is the same as any other gram. They're fungible. If you switch them out, it doesn't matter. This stamp is non-fungible, not just because it's the only one left, but because of its history.  It's a unique object.  The stamp was actually first discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old schoolboy. Now, at the time it would have been nothing unusual, because over time, multiple stamps of everything else were discovered. But this is the only stamp in British Commonwealth history where no other examples have ever turned up. It passed through an increasingly  prestigious list of the greatest names in philatelic history. Stanley Gibbons is the world's oldest stamp dealership. We have an auction house, two retail teams, and a coin company called Baldwins. Stanley Gibbons was lucky enough to purchase the stamp at auction in New York. And now it's on display  every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, just for conservation and light reasons, but indefinitely here in an oxygen-free conservation case. This stamp has repeatedly set the record for most expensive, and every time it does, it adds another line to its already very long history. It's expensive because it's rare.  Yes, there is only one of these in the world,  and the way our society works, someone's got to own it. But outside stamp collector circles, not many people would care about ""the rarest stamp"".  But to the wider world, it's famous because it's expensive, and more fame will likely make it more expensive.  And I guess I'm helping that cycle continue by making this video about it. I wouldn't claim to know the company's motivations, but I'd suspect that it's on display to the public here, at least in part, because the company is selling shares in it  and more fame will help it keep or raise its value. This is not an endorsement, by the way. I approached them about filming. They've not paid me.  I have no desire to buy or sell a share in a stamp. But if you want to challenge this for ""the most expensive object in the world by weight"", and take the very, very tiny crown, well, the first step would be finding something even lighter than 40 milligrams, but just as historic and just as non-fungible. Good luck."
12,"An actual, real-world use for robot dogs","Every time Boston Dynamics puts out one of their big YouTube productions, the world is amazed. The robots dance. Or they do parkour. All of which is very impressive, but it's under controlled conditions in a lab. It's not exactly a practical, real-world use. So what are those robots actually being used for in the real world? Inside this mountainside in western Austria is a hydroelectric power plant. I would have filmed this piece-to-camera actually down in the turbine hall, but... [shouting over industrial noise] It's a bit loud in here!  At full capacity, 150 tons of water a second goes down from the uphill reservoir, through the turbines in the cavern, generating 350 megawatts of power. And it's all run remotely. Switching this plant on and off is done at a control center about half an hour's drive that way, where they also control twenty other hydro plants. On a normal day, no-one works here at all. But for safety, someone does have to regularly drive out to all those twenty power plants, and check the physical things are all as they should be. So you can probably see where this is going. We are using a robot to continuously do inspection tasks, and therefore testing if this is plausible in the middle of the Alps. Energy Robotics is putting software on robots to make them smart. We are a software company and we're not building the hardware. We are writing code.  Therefore, we ask other companies to build the hardware for us, or use existing robots already.  We work with a lot of robot companies. We're picking the best robot for the task.  Boston Dynamics and other companies build the actual physical robots, and provide a remote controller that someone can use to directly move the bots around. But they also provide an interface for computer code. The robot has built-in navigation and obstacle avoidance, so in the same way that you can write code to automate things on a regular computer, you can write code for the robot dog's computer too. Your code can learn the whole site that you're working at and tell the bot, OK, find your way to this point. Look at this thing. Take a picture or a temperature reading. And if that picture doesn't look like it should, or there's something blocking your way, let us know about it. The robot is not remote controlled. It's doing that task autonomously.  That means we teach it a certain mission.  And the robot does the repetition of the mission. But it'll also be, in the future, able to do something called ""click and inspect"". That means we have a digital twin of the environment, and then we're just saying what the robot needs to inspect. And the robot plans a path towards the inspection point and gets the information. The robot autonomously extracts that information and reacts based on the results, which means either it sends an alarm if it's out of the norm, or it just collects information, then puts it into the report at the end of the mission.  You can send robot dogs into toxic or radioactive environments humans shouldn't be in.  But this isn't a particularly dangerous site. They let me in, after all. It's just inconvenient to drive here,  particularly in winter, when snowstorms might close the mountain road entirely. This is a place designed for humans, though, which is why robots with wheels or tracks aren't an option. So it's important to have a robot which is capable to operate in human environment, because all the infrastructure humans have built has been built for humans. So therefore, we need the robot to be capable of interacting with its environment, meaning simply: every other situation like here where we need to climb stairs, we're using a robot on legs. In the substation,  where we have flat ground, for example, we're using robots on wheels or on tracks. We're developing a skill which we'll use in oil and gas, where many of our robots are actually working, which we call ""Man Down Detector"", so that if the robot detects someone lying on the ground, because of whatever incident, then the robot sounds an alarm, and therefore brings the troops to help the person lying on the ground. This trial will succeed or fail based on two questions. First, does it work reliably?  And second, if so, is it cheaper overall than sending out people, people, particularly when there might be a shortage of engineers soon? The goal is to support human inspection, and in the long run to replace certain parts, especially those where humans need to be sent in hazardous environments. In Germany, we have about 8,000 substations. All of those need to have inspections, and the number of substations is growing due to the change to renewable energy. We need to have more robots on the ground, because we have not enough engineers in the workforce right now, and we need about 400,000 more in the next ten years.  The robot can perform up to twelve hours of inspections: sixty minutes walking around, sixty minutes charging, so a lot of inspection every day. Over the next few years,  we're also testing assisted manipulation, where the robot is with a human doing manipulation tasks within infrastructure environments. In the future that might be fully autonomous manipulation, but there's probably some years to go. If this works and if it gets rolled out, then the power companies will be saving employee time and therefore money. In the same way that twenty power plants can now be controlled from one center, twenty power plants could be inspected from one center,  with actual human engineers dispatched only when there's actually something wrong that needs to be fixed. And I suspect it will be a while  before the robots start to take over that job as well."
13,The Islands With Too Much Power,"Yes, I am standing somewhere windswept  and talking about infrastructure. I have a style! Also, that whooshing sound you can hear? That's the other turbine  that you can't see in this camera shot. Anyway. Power grids!  They have to balance supply and demand. I've talked about that a few times  in the past here. But as a quick catch up, if there's not enough power  being generated, things break. But if there's too much power  being generated, things also break. And arguably in a worse way.  There isn't a battery in the world  big enough to deal with the daily peaks  and troughs of national demand. So power grid engineers have to make sure  that the power being generated is always close to the power  that's being used. There are a lot of possible technologies  to help with that balance. And I've talked about some of those  before here, too.  Pumped storage that uses a lake  as a giant battery, or even the big lithium-ion setup in Australia  that's only caught on fire once so far. But all of those technologies  assume that supply and demand will balance each other out over time,  usually over a few hours. What happens if you always  have too much power? Welcome to the Orkney Islands, in the far  north east of Scotland. About 22,000 people live here, on around  1,000 windswept square kilometers. And they have so much renewable energy  from wind and waves and tides that it's genuinely a problem.  Solution number one is: turn off the turbines. 2013, we were producing  up to 130% of our electrical needs. So there can be quite a lot of curtailment  on several turbines. There's active network management.  The wind turbine will be shut down  because the network can't handle the load. There's been a moratorium  on any new grid connections. There is potential for some  microgeneration, but nothing of any scale. So when you're in a place like Orkney,  where you have some of the best generation potential,  it's a complete waste. Turning off the turbines  isn't a good solution. It's wasteful. Depending on the time of day and year,  these islands need between 7 and 46 megawatts. It's almost always windy here, so a couple of big commercial wind farms like this can produce all the power that folks here need. But they've also got 500  domestic turbines, privately owned. 1 in 12 households  generate their own power.  Because why wouldn't you?  Once you pay the installation costs,  you'll probably turn a profit, year after year after year. One of the things I struggled with, writing this script. is that there is so much going on up here.  There's an electric hybrid plane being tested at the airport. There are tidal power experiments, wave power experiments. Every type of renewable energy, almost, is being tested here. ...there's not much solar.  And there's a backup:  for the very rare days when the wind is calm,  there are interconnector cables that can pull up to 40 megawatts  from the Scottish mainland. But OK: they're generating  a massive surplus of power, and they're connected  to the British National Grid. So surely solution number two is: use those interconnectors? They can just sell the extra power  back to the mainland. Well, those 40 megawatts  that the interconnectors can handle? That's not actually all that much. The interconnector cables  we've got are small. We reckon there's 2,000 megawatts of tidal  and wave generation around here. We reckon there's 17,000  megawatts of offshore wind within a couple of hundred  kilometers of here.  The interconnector was built  for an old day when you used to burn coal  and send us electricity. That's gone. We don't do that anymore.  We now need to be in a position where  we've got a better way to get the power from these islands away.  If the new interconnector is built,  it carry enough power for all the turbines that Orkney could  reasonably put up in the next few years. They could power most of the highlands of Scotland.  But building that new interconnector  will cost a quarter of a billion pounds. National government requires  that the islands approve plans for enough new turbines to make sure it's  going to be used, before it's approved. That's all still  in the balance politically.  So solution number three is that the islands could start using more electricity.  There's already a larger share of electric cars here than anywhere else in Scotland. But most vehicles still use petrol or diesel. That could change.  There's still a lot of oil heating. The ferries, vital for getting around,  still burn fossil fuels. The transition is a slow process.  No one's going to scrap a perfectly good car or heater or ferry unless they have to.  But there are plans.  And Orkney's also had  a hydrogen fuel system for years,  to help soak up a bit of the excess power. We're producing hydrogen from,  effectively, spare electricity. That's why we started.  We're taking electricity,  putting it into fresh water, and it splits the water  into hydrogen and oxygen. We're getting rid of the oxygen  and we're just capturing the hydrogen. We're compressing it,  and then we're using it in this fuel cell. We have ferries that operate  within the islands.  One of those ferries  is able to be powered by this fuel cell  when it ties up alongside at night. And it saves it running its own engines,  or it saves it drawing  power from the grid. This is just the start of something.  This equipment is experimental  and believe me, it's not efficient. This is not the best way of doing it.  But we're finding our way  into new territory. We try and unearth  some of the challenges so that when we  scale this equipment up, then those faults have been polished out.  These islands are years  ahead of the rest of the world. This is the test bed.  This is a small version of the changes  that the whole planet is going to make. The transition to renewables  is happening faster here in Orkney than,  I think, anywhere else in the world. But as you travel around these islands,  it just seems normal. Nothing's visibly changed, but the lessons that they're learning here will hopefully  pave the way for the rest of the world."
14,The Shocking New Use for Red Telephone Boxes,"Red telephone boxes like this one are an icon of Britain, or, well, they were. Nowadays, the boxes that are left are falling into disrepair and ruin because there's not much demand for payphones these days. If a little village wants to save theirs, then the phone company will sell it to them for Â£1, enough to make the contract legal and binding, but they won't keep the phone connected. So what do you do with a disused phone box? Well, one of the options being installed right here might help to save lives. Community Heartbeat Trust is currently the leading organisation for the provision of community defibrillators in the UK. Today we've probably positioned 6,500 community defibrillators or thereabouts. It costs somewhere between around Â£1600 and Â£2200, depending on the equipment. It turns out the logistics aren't quite as simple as ""buy a defibrillator and stick it in a box"". A defibrillator is a medical device, if it's poorly maintained or it breaks, then it could be worse than useless. It could actually do harm. There is no use just putting it in and then forgetting about it. These need to be looked after and it's got to be as good in several years' time as it is on day one. And it's got to be sustainable, it's not just about raising funds initially, it's also about ongoing costs and ongoing fundraising to make sure that this is actually looked after for the entire life that it's going to be in the community. Well, the first thing we need to find out from the process is: is the kiosk actually available? They can't decommission it unless there's a mobile phone signal for emergencies. When a community contacts us, we'll let the local ambulance service know that a defibrillator is going in, and then it's available in an emergency. When somebody phones 999, the ambulance service will be able to say ""There is a defibrillator, ""it's located at the phone box, on the corner of X and Y roads."" And if the cabinet is locked, they'll give an access code. Once the defibrillator is used, we just take out the old pads, put on new ones, run a self check to make sure the defibrillator is working properly, and then it's ready for action again. And there's another question: who pays for the power? The box is connected to the national grid so the light and the phone could work back when it was an actual phone box, but it doesn't have an electricity meter. It's never needed one. The electricity is there to provide electricity for the cabinet because there's a heater in the cabinet. It's not for the defibrillator, the defibrillators all work off batteries. And the heater in the cabinets keeps the defibrillator above freezing in cold weather. That's really quite important because batteries do degrade in cold weather. The electrodes are water gel so they will freeze. British Telecom, who's the major phone company in the UK, are the people who actually originally own these. It actually costs BT money to take out the electricity. So they would rather leave the electricity in, what they do with us is: they donate that to us as charity and then we provide the electricity to the community. So the estimated cost for a kiosk to run it for a year is about Â£5-10. All of this might sound good in theory. But the question is: could a bystander with no medical training actually use one of these to save a life? To answer that, I've come to the headquarters of the East of England Ambulance Service who are going to let me try their training defibrillator. It doesn't actually produce a shock, we just need to use it on a dummy, but it is as realistic a simulation as it's possible to get. So here's the story. Someone has collapsed, someone else is doing CPR, and I've been sent by the emergency operator to get this. So the very first thing you do is turn it on and listen to the voice prompts. It will tell you to follow it calmly, which is a really important thing to do. So we assume there's someone here doing CPR, and now I have to take this... On/Off. [defibrillator beeps] ""Call Emergency Medical Services now."" Okay, we've done that. ""Adult mode."" Yes. ""Follow the voice prompt calmly."" Okay. ""Remove all clothing from chest and stomach."" It's really important that all of the clothing is removed, we want a bare chest. There are concerns over maintaining dignity... life comes before dignity. Take out the pads from the bottom of the device, okay. The next thing it'll ask you is to apply the pads to the chest. So the first pad, you're going to put on the patient's right shoulder, the second pad you're going to put just below their left armpit. Just... there. ""Peel off the pad labelled 2."" Okay. ""And stick to the bare skin of the patient, ""exactly as shown in the picture."" Exactly as shown in the picture, just below there. Okay. [defibrillator beeps] ""Do not touch the patient."" ""Analysing heart rhythm."" At this point, it will tell you not to touch the patient, and that's really important, it's going to be analysing that heart rhythm. One of the ones it's going to be looking for is where the heart is just wobbling around, where there's no regularity to it and it is not able to pump blood. What it needs to do then, is stop that heart with an electric shock. Once it's stopped it, the natural pacemaker of the heart can kick back in and put the heart back into a normal rhythm where it can pump blood. ""Shock advised."" Okay. [defibrillator beeping] ""Stand clear."" ""Press the flashing orange button now."" [beep stops] ""Shock delivered."" [defibrillator beeping] ""Begin CPR now."" If they are in a rhythm that the AED can shock it will increase their chance of survival about 10% per minute. [rhythmic clicking] ""Reanalyzing heart rhythm... ""...in one minute."" Oh. So I've arrived at a call where there is a defib, it has been used and it's been used successfully. And the patient has started breathing again prior to my arrival. ""Analysing heart rhythm."" It is the human equivalent of turning someone off then on again. ""Shock advised."" If you haven't had any form of training, you can still use a defibrillator, you shouldn't be prevented from doing it, but you should be trained in order to get the most efficient usage of that equipment. So I assume this would continue until emergency services actually arrive? So yes, once we arrive, we'll take over what you're doing. We'll attach our defibrillator and take over management of the patient. I realised when it said ""start CPR"", that I don't actually know about that, I only know what I've picked up from media? So I'm hoping I was vaguely in the right position there. Yep, absolutely. I need to go do proper first aid training. Thank you! Ideally, it could have done  with just being up a bit on the shoulder rather than there, but, you know, that would have worked. That would work. The main thing is, that would have done the job. Right. You were in the centre of the chest there, doing the chest compressions, right speed. It was fine. You would have saved their life, if it was saveable, you would have done it. Which is all that matters. Thank you very much!"
15,History forgot these old fireworks. We recreated them.,"All through the old mining areas of Northwest Wales, if you know where to look, you can find rock cannon. This is the best known one in what's now a tourist town called Betws-y-Coed. Rock cannon are big lumps of rock with small holes drilled into them. And in the 19th century, if there was something to be celebrated in a mining town round here, locals would light fireworks, bonfires, and also fire rock cannon. Put gunpowder in the little holes, connect them up with more gunpowder, either in little channels or by sticking it on with goose grease. Stick a feather in one end as a fuse, light it, and stand well back. There are more than 200 rock cannon around Wales and they were used for all sorts of events. Visiting royalty? Greeted by rock cannon. Big wedding to celebrate? Rock cannon. First train on a new railway? Rock cannon. It wasn't an everyday thing, but it definitely wasn't once in a lifetime either. It doesn't happen much any more, sadly. They more or less faded out in the mid-20th century. Most of the mines have closed and far fewer people have ready access to explosives these days. I did consider asking if I could bring some gunpowder and fire a cannon, but an  Englishman coming to North Wales and saying, ""Can I put gunpowder in your historical artefacts ""and create a big explosion in the middle of a national park"" is... not a good look? So instead... ...I asked the explosives engineer I know if he'd be able to build one, out here on the test range. And he said yes, but... it's two months later. And I don't think either of us realised quite how much work this was going to be. For him. I was expecting to cast it one day, and then a week later come back and just pull the bits out and: all ready to go. It ended up being three or four weekends and a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears. I started off by making some moulds. So they're just bits of dowel chopped off and nailed onto some boards with the right spacings. I waxed all of these pieces, so they should extract, nice and easily, out of the concrete. We then came to cast the concrete. We had to get a digger in to spread it around. We then placed the boards on with these pegs, pushed down into the concrete. I then came back the following weekend to remove the boards and to pull the pegs up, 'cause they'd been nicely waxed. So they should pull out that easily. They did not pull out that easily. I eventually came back the weekend after, got them all out. Then it rained for all of May. But we're here now! And once we're done with this it's going to get screeded over, so I'll never have to see it again! Back in the day, the Welsh miners would use goose quill. It was the only sort of natural tube you could find. So they'd chop a piece of goose quill, fill it full of gunpowder, and then when you light one end of it, it'll burn incrementally from that end down and then squirt a bit of flame out of the other end. And that's what they would then put down each of the holes. What I've done is then put some black powder at the bottom of the hole, goose quill into that, tamp the black powder down, then a little bit of newspaper to separate it out. The channels between all the holes are linked up with black powder. The definitive source for information about Welsh rock cannons is a book by Griff R. Jones called ""The Rock Cannon of Gwynedd"". The book actually had a scale map of Betws-y-Coed cannon in it. So I was able to scan that. Each hole's accurate to within about an inch of where they were on the real thing. So: shot one. This is an exact replica of the cannon at Betws-y-Coed and we're going to fire it. This should be pretty much what a visiting dignitary would hear echoing round the Welsh valleys as their train rolled into the station. Let's go. I mean, that was lovely. Like, the steady glow as it went through and then boom, boom, boom for each one. Yeah. I like how the wads of newspaper just shot up after a while. Yeah. One of the things I really want to stress is that building rock cannon takes skill. If you were to chisel the holes in the wrong places or along the wrong fracture lines, like in this next test, well. That could be disastrous. For a rock cannon, you want something that is going to maintain the hole and keep it there and you can reuse it. Let's say you got this sedimentary rock in multiple layers and you bore that way. You're going to end up with fracture and stress lines in the rock  where it could easily split apart. So I've cast some concrete, that's perfectly been cast in layers just to demonstrate that if you make a weak rock canon it will not do the job. Right. All cameras rolling. How far away should I be? About 20 to 30 yards back. Okay, good luck. I saw the rock split and come back together there. It was weak because that's the way it's been cast but the amount of force that bolted that outwards...! Final test then. What can we do with modern science? Well, I think we can have a few firework effects in, give it a bit of colour. We'll reload the 55-shot Welsh cannon and try again. Lovely. I can't believe this GoPro's still working. It's still good. So I do apologise to the people of Wales. Not only have a couple of Englishmen copied your historical artefacts, we've been bold enough to think we might be able to improve it a bit. We hope you'll forgive us. And if not, we hope you'll at least enjoy the show. Right. Are we ready? Yup. Good to go. Yep, that'll do! I think we improved on the Welsh. I'm going to claim that. Thank you very much. I'd shake your hands, but... We're not allowed to. Yep. This is a replica of the cannon of-[incoherent surprised noise] There's a hole there. There's a hole. Don't fall in the hole."
16,The world's last turntable ferry has a really clever design,"When I first heard the idea of a turntable ferry, I assumed it was an early design before anyone figured out how to do ferries properly. A modern cross-river ferry is built with the cabin at the side so cars can drive on and drive off without having to awkwardly reverse. So, I figured a turntable ferry like this one is going to be a prototype solution before anyone figured out how to put the cabin at the side. Instead of having the cars reverse off, you turn the whole car deck around. And yes, that does happen here, but the real reason for the turntable is more clever than that. And there's only one of them left anywhere in the world, here in western Scotland, over the sea to Skye. There's been a ferry here since the 1700s, people say; a vehicle ferry certainly since the 1930s. This particular ferry has been here since the 1980s, and it was operated by a man called Roddy MacLeod. And when the tolls were removed from the Skye Bridge, he felt probably that the ferry's time was up, really, 'cause you could get across the bridge for nothing, so who would pay to go on the ferry? So, the local community banded together and thought, ""We can't have this. ""Not having the ferry is a social experiment ""we don't want to be involved in."" So, a little group of folk got together and saved the ferry and brought it into community ownership, which it still is today. There is quite a strong current. The current can be up to nine knots in the strait, but that's exceptional. Current and wind together can make things interesting. The ferry is very seldom pointing in the direction it's actually going. Because of the wind and because of the tide, we often have to set the boat going in a different direction to allow us to get to where we want to go. The water here is tidal and the current is fast. Simple ferry designs are great if you've got steady water that's always at the same height. Your boat arrives, puts down a ramp to the shore, and the cars can drive on and off. But if the water's tidal, well, that ramp could need to go three or four metres up or down depending on the time of day, so the only way it works is if you build infrastructure on the riverbanks: floating pontoons and large ramps that give the cars enough room to drive up and down. That's far too big and expensive for somewhere like this, so the obvious solution is a slipway: a boat ramp, a long gentle approach to the water. In a lot of places, that does work. Sail up to the water's edge, drop a ramp, and everyone stays dry no matter the water's height. But that means you need a long, long slipway and, importantly, your boat needs to be lined up straight. Here in this narrow channel, the current can be so strong that isn't possible. Even if you could line up straight reliably, you can only tie the boat off at the front, so the back's probably going to swing out a bit. So, what you want to do is what a passenger ferry does: pull up alongside the slipway and let people get off sideways. Great for people, not so useful for cars. And that's where the turntable comes in. The turntable is a remarkable piece of Victorian engineering. It was based on the old railway turntable system. Cars could come onto the boat from any jetty at any state of the tide to then be turned round and be able to drive off. Usually, it's two, but one person can turn it. A lot of oil and grease is expended in keeping it as smooth as we can! The way that the boat is designed, it draws virtually no draught at all forward and it's only four-and-a-half feet at the stern, so it can come alongside in very shallow water. That was the part of the design that makes them so versatile. Very, very, very rare indeed that we can't work. It would have to be an exceptionally low tide. Before the invention of the roll-on/roll-off ferry, these were the original roll-on/roll-off ferries. Now, there's been a bridge across to Skye north of here since 1995, so these days this is mostly used just by locals and as a tourist attraction in the summer. But if you are in this area, well, I'd recommend taking a diversion and driving across this way because there's only one place in the world where you can drive off a turntable like this. Thank you very much!"
17,The long-forgotten history of the British moon spacesuit,"A spacesuit has to do three things. It has to maintain pressure so your blood doesn't start boiling in the vacuum of space. It has to provide oxygen so you can breathe. And it has to protect against the environment: extreme heat, extreme cold, and direct sunlight. This... ...won't do any of those. It's just a replica of that one. That's the actual Sokol spacesuit that Tim Peake, the most recent British astronaut, used in space. The folks here at the National Space Centre wouldn't let me try on a real one, which is fair enough. Versions of that suit have been protecting astronauts since the 1970s. And there are variants still used today. It's not designed for hours-long space walks. It's basically an emergency personal lifeboat for if the ship you're travelling on... uh, springs a leak. And it provides those three things: pressure, oxygen, environmental protection. Now a couple of months ago, I had a video where an AI tried to suggest stories and titles that I could cover. And one of the things it came up with was ""the long-forgotten history of the British moon landings"". Not strictly true, of course. We never actually got there. But one of the team here got in touch, and it turns out that in the 1940s, 15 years before Kennedy said that America ""chose to go to the moon"", the British Interplanetary Society did have similar plans, including our own spacesuit. The BIS was set up in 1933 by a man called Phil Cleator. And he had this plan. He wanted to get together with like-minded individuals who were interested in space flight, and what the possible future of space flight might be. Rocket technology was suddenly moving forward in a way that, actually, spaceflight was something tangible and might well be realistic. The BIS weren't seriously expecting to launch a mission to the moon on their own. But they did want to say, ""Hey, we think this is possible. And we think Britain should do it."" And one of their number, illustrator Ralph Smith, drew up plans for a spacesuit. So we have an exhibition here at the National Space Centre that focuses on the space race. And people tend to think about America and the Soviet Union. And we wanted to tell something of what Britain was up to at the same time. As we were planning for our exhibition, we were leafing through a research document and looking at the history of the BIS. And immediately this picture jumped out of somebody wearing this incrediblelooking spacesuit that they'd designed. And immediately we just said, ""We have to make this."" It looks wonderful, but no one ever built it... until a few years ago. So, I get a call, and where do you start? You've got two drawings basically. Rather than just say, ""Well, I'll make a replica, a facsimile of it."" I thought ""Let's look at the materials that were available at the time."" Cotton and rubber, much like a modern space suit is made out of beta fabric and a rubber pressure layer inside. And the pressure's inside it. It can't expand out any further. It can't balloon out. He would have an oxygen supply in his backpack there. So he's being fed this oxygen supply going through, past his face, down through the suit, and recycling back into the backpack again for expulsion in the way just like an Apollo suit did. Here you've got what we call the ""convolutes"". And they're to give a bit of movement at the arm. And right up here, you've got cloth of silver. If he's getting cold on the surface of the moon, he can then pull this cape around him. And now any heat that's radiating out from the suit, he can then trap that heat in. And it reflects the heat back into the body again. So these little pins here, they are, in fact little stand-off mushrooms. So when the cape is hanging over them, there's a gap between the surface of the suit and the surfaces of the cape. And that gap of vacuum means there's no physical thermal transfer from the suit out into the vacuum of space. You'll have noticed that on the front of his chest, he's got this rather strange device here. This is an airlock. Imagine the circumstances. You're on the surface of the moon. You find an interesting rock. You open the airlock. You put the rock into the air lock. You close the airlock. Now you withdraw your arms inside the suit through these exceptionally large holes here. And using that long front, you can examine that rock that you've just taken off the lunar surface. But you also notice, there is a shooting stick. And it gives you a walking stick-cum-seat. You get tired on the surface of the moon. You open the seat part of the shooting stick and you sit down. They've kind of thought of everything, really. So how do you build something like this and stay to those 1940s techniques? We turned to what would have been available at the time, even to this silver finish here on the helmet. And in fact, the people we went to to get this vacuum plating done, they were the original company that would have been doing the original if it had ever happened. And in fact, when we took the helmet into them, they said, ""Oh, well, we finally got to do it then."" There's newsreel footage from the 1940s which says the BIS estimated half a million pounds to send someone to the moon. In today's money, that's about 20 million. The Apollo program roughly cost the US government 10,000 times that. It's safe to say that the BIS's plans were optimistic. So how well would the British spacesuit have held up against an actual trip to the moon? We're pretty sure this would be the Mark 1. If this had ever really walked on the moon, this would have been the Mark 8, the Mark 9. Remember on the moon, you only have to pressurise up, if you're breathing pure oxygen, to about 4Â½ pounds per square inch. This easily would have been capable of taking that pressure, but it just would have been pretty immobile. You simply can't lift your arms up very high. Because of the nature of this deep shoulder means that the arm just can't rise up. I think the BIS were very serious about going to the moon. They had nowhere near as much information as NASA would have had in the 1950s and '60s about the realities of space flight, and particularly the challenges of getting to the moon. But certainly these weren't crazy people just throwing around ideas. There were lots of really talented people. They were just nowhere near as complex in terms of the materials that they had, but they weren't available to them at the time. So who knows? Had they have had the time and the money to develop the sort of space-age materials that went into some of those later suits, more time to practice and actually do some practical experiments, then who knows? Quite possibly. Thank you so much to everyone at the National Space Centre. Along with the space suits, they've got rockets and satellites, and an actual piece of the moon. You can find out more about them at the link in the description. I mean, it's probably a good thing that the real ones are made to measure, 'cause, um..."
18,I promise this story about microwaves is interesting.,"And... rolling. I can't clickbait this video. I mean, I could, but it wouldn't really be fair to anyone involved. I know the title and the thumbnail aren't going to pull loads of people in, but I hope that you can trust me when I say: I promise this story is really interesting. Because it is. This is one of the best things I've found while researching in years. So this starts when I'm looking up old television shows and I'm about three research tangents deep, and I find this incredible line in a newspaper article from 1997: ""The microwave was invented to meet a need ""to heat hamsters humanely in 1950s laboratories."" And I read that and I thought: that's ridiculous. No, it wasn't. Was it? There's a well-known story about the engineer who ""invented the microwave"". Percy Spencer, just after World War II, was working on one of the new military-grade radars while it was active, and he realised that the peanut bar in his back pocket had melted. Which implies that the radar also nearly cooked part of him as well? Unshielded radars are really dangerous, but it was the 1940s. The attitude to safety was a bit more lax. Now it wasn't a surprise that electromagnetic radiation could heat stuff. That had been known for a while. People had actually been using it for medical therapies for a while. Different wavelengths had different effects, but Percy Spencer was the first person to realise you could cook efficiently with the wavelengths that were put out by radar, and then realised that you could sell that, and then realised, well, I could turn that into a usable product. Because a massive radar dish is basically the same technology as this microwave. I'm not going to try and take this thing apart. I'm not qualified. And there is a high-voltage capacitor in here which can carry enough charge to kill. Don't mess about with these unless you know what you're doing. But inside here is... Inside here in the bit you can't access, there's a microwave generator called a magnetron. It moves electric current past a big magnet with a hole in it. And because... physics, that produces electromagnetic radiation. Tune the size of the hole in the magnet, you get different frequencies of radiation. The best analogy I've found is that it's like blowing air over glass bottles and changing the pitch by changing the amount of water inside. So... [glass whistling at different tones]. That, but with electricity. ...look, I don't have a physics degree. Long story short, a magnetron converts electricity into electromagnetic radiation. You send pulses of that radiation out into the sky and you listen for the echoes, you've got radar and you've helped win World War II. Or you could put a magnetron inside a safe radiation-proof box called a Faraday cage, you tune the wavelengths so that water absorbs the radiation easily, and you've got a microwave. And you can cook lunch. The technical term is ""diathermic heating"". In less than a year after the melting peanut bar incident, which could so easily have been, like, the ""cooked hand incident"" or worse, but less than a year after that that engineer's company, defence contractor Raytheon, they release the first commercial microwave. It was called the Radarange. It was the size of a fridge. It had to be actively cooled. It was incredibly expensive and it was designed for big commercial kitchens. That was 1947. The first microwave as we'd know it today, a cheap box that you plug in, that was from the late 1960s once magnetron technology had moved on a bit. At no point in that well-referenced, well-known story does anyone mention heating hamsters in laboratories in the 1950s. [microwave dings] So that should be pretty easy to disprove, right? It's going to be an urban legend. There are a lot of urban legends like that. So I started doing some journal searches and pretty quickly I found papers from the 1950s talking about the reanimation of frozen rats and hamsters. Those papers were written by scientists at the National Institute for Medical Research, a government laboratory in Mill Hill, in suburban North London, about half a mile that way. I would have filmed closer to that, but unfortunately, it was pulled down a few years ago and the whole area is now a load of new-build housing. Anyway, National Institute For Medical Research. In the 1950s, that research included cryobiology, the effects of extreme cold on bodies and tissue. Scientists at that lab froze rats and hamsters beyond the point of death. They used ice and a bath of propylene glycol, which is airplane de-icer, held at below zero, and at that point, the animal is dead and will not recover on its own. No heart rate, no breathing, core temperature around 1Â°C, somewhere between 10 and 50% of the animal's body water frozen to ice. And then by applying hot spatulas to the chest or high-intensity hot beams of light the researchers would try to warm the animals up and bring them back to life. The success rate wasn't great and the animals were often left with burns, but it did sometimes work. We'll get to why they were doing that later! But by 1955, one of the researchers has the idea to use a magnetron, reasoning that it'd be a lot more safe and humane to reheat the whole animal at once rather than risk burning it. Actually, I say one of the researchers, there's a name on that paper that might be a bit familiar. James Lovelock, one of the last independent scientists, born in 1919, back when ""scientist"" could be an entire job description rather than ""botanist"" or ""physicist"" or ""computational linguist"". Someone who worked across disciplines on whatever they found interesting or whatever they were hired to do. Lovelock is best known for inventing Gaia theory, the idea of earth as a self-regulating system. He also invented the electronic capture detector which found CFCs in the atmosphere and helped discover the ozone hole. Hardware that he helped design for NASA is sitting on Mars because it landed there with the Viking probes in 1976. And one of the early projects in his career, back in the 1950s was at the National Institute for Medical Research freezing rats and hamsters, and he had the idea to use microwave di-a-ther-my..., dia-tha-my? dia-tha...? [keyboard clicks] ""Diathermy."" To reheat them. But the papers and anecdotes from back then all seem to contradict each other. The timeline is difficult to piece together. There are reliable sources with completely different stories and claims. So I went to ask him about it. ""Do you know you're the first person to come ""and ask me about the freezing work?"" Because James Lovelock, at 101 years old lives somewhere vaguely round here on the south coast of England, goes for a walk along the coast every day, and was happy to be interviewed. One biologist, Audrey Smith, was able to revive a hamster that had been frozen. When they woke up, they got a gigantic burn all across their chest and that must have been pretty painful, and it was messy. I thought, this is a lousy way to do it. So I said, ""Why don't you use diathermy?"" For 10 shillings of my own money I bought a surplus RAF transmitter, joined it up, and sure enough, it poured out 30 watts at 30 megahertz,  Which is just about right. And I took it into the lab the next day. And I said, ""Look, here's your diathermy."" I thought this is very untidy, made some inquiries and sure enough, there were 10-centimetre magnetrons that had been invented by Boot and Randall at Birmingham University during the war. To get hold of one of those is not easy. And this is where being in a government department helped a bit. So I just made a few inquiries. ""How do I get hold...?"" And they said, ""Oh, well, they're working on them down at... just above Portsmouth."" I said, ""Any chance of borrowing one of your magnetrons?"" And he said, ""Oh no."" He said, ""We can give you one if you want. It's an interesting cause, why not?"" I've joined this up with a waveguide, into a metal box. It wasn't so much a box. It was just a thing made out of chicken wire, except it's finer than chicken wire, a bit closer to mesh. And that was just like the box of a microwave oven. And I fed the microwaves into it. And I told Audrey, now, put your hamster in there! That's a microwave. James Lovelock may not have invented THE first microwave but he certainly invented A microwave. The idea of using magnetrons to heat stuff wasn't his, but no one else was putting one in a Faraday cage box on a desktop. Big commercial microwaves for restaurant kitchens aren't the same thing, and besides, they weren't even on sale in the UK until a few years later. I put a potato in it and baked it. And it was perfectly all right. The safety procedures were occasionally a bit lax by modern standards. In the course of the experiments while we were building it the thing was running open and the radiation was bouncing all round the room and the light bulbs would light up without warning. The filament just had the same wavelength as the radiation, and it would absorb it and light up. And pound notes were the funniest one. They'd catch fire because the metal strip inside was just about the wavelength of the magnetron. And here's the really amazing thing, it worked. We put the hamster in there, frozen solid. And I mean frozen solid. It was like a bit of wood when you dropped it on the bench. Turned the thing up to full power on the microwave, which was about a kilowatt coming out of it. And with a timer. And after so many seconds, the hamster woke up, started wandering around. Do I need to say, don't try this at home? I mean there are enough people of all ages watching that statistically yes, I do need to say it. Don't try this at home. It's unnecessary cruelty. You won't be doing medical research, you'll be doing a crime. Context is really important, but also the research has been done! More than 50 years ago. There are charts of survival rate and heating, and it turns out that with a microwave, because that's what this was, with a precise calibrated microwave and with artificial respiration to start pumping oxygen around the body almost every rodent they froze was successfully reanimated. That's the word that the biologists use. Reanimation. Healthy, behaving as usual and given a retirement at an animal home, according to one of the papers. Back from being frozen to death, sometimes multiple times. So the last question is: why? Well, this could be of immense importance to medicine. So for preserving tissues for transfer and also for blood transfusions because at the moment blood was kept at the blood bank for three weeks and then thrown down the sink. Imagine if that had worked on bigger animals. Back then humanity did not know what the limits were. This was an open question. The reason that all those 1960s science fiction writers and comic book authors had people being frozen in time or astronauts being sent off in cryosleep might be because, for a little while, it looked like that might actually be possible. If freezing and diathermic reheating worked on hamsters... then maybe it would work on rabbits. If it worked on rabbits, then maybe it'd work on primates. And if it worked on primates... then maybe it'd work on humans. It didn't, unfortunately. It doesn't scale up. You cannot freeze a human. It's partly a matter of how quickly you can get the anti-freeze agent to diffuse into the cells. A human's too big. It's just a matter of size. A hamster is an acceptable size. Sometimes research hits a brick wall. Find out a neat thing about hamsters, check. Casually invent a microwave and then don't commercialise it. Check. Find a way to safely send astronauts to other planets? Not this time, unfortunately, but the researchers tried and that feels like a story that shouldn't be buried as a vague anecdote in a newspaper from years ago. I think in an awful lot of science where there's a success it's not a scientific thing. It's an invention, which is something quite different. And I think personally I'm much more of an inventor than a scientist. My thanks to James Lovelock for his time. His latest book ""Novacene"" is part memoir and part look to the future and there's a link to it in the description. Oh, that was a mistake. That was... I... Oh that's going to be a nightmare to wash. All right, well, I guess I don't get a second take, 'cos... I put that on low!"
19,Why Hollywood explosions don't look like real explosions,"[dramatic music] There is one kilo of Semtex plastic explosive back there. This ought to look good. [brief, muted explosion] Okay. That didn't look great on camera. Neither did I. The film industry has a lot of tricks to make the explosions in movies look like the audience expects them to, all fire and flame and devastation. So now, we've seen what an actual explosion looks like. Let's see how Hollywood does it. There are two parts to the trick, and the first is what you're actually blowing up. We've just blown up one kilo of Semtex 1A, which is a PETN based plastic explosive. Now that's real military explosive. So for a Hollywood effect, we don't actually use the Semtex because it does a lot of damage. It's designed to do damage for its military purpose. We don't want that. We want something that looks nice but does the minimum amount of damage possible. So what we're going to use is some detonating cord to burst a bag full of petrol, and that will be ignited as it goes out by an ignition charge off to one side. And we're going to do this in three pots called mortar pots. And that will direct the fuel as it flies out. And then it gets ignited, and that produces a nice, big explosive effect. There are loads of flames and fire and dirty smoke. We do that to just pointing towards the camera. We don't want to bother sending it backwards or to the sides, particularly. We only want it where it's going to do the effect that we want. For the three pots full of fuel, we're probably going to use less than 10 grams in each of them. The reason we're getting a bigger effect using less explosive is because of the fuel. We're putting that in there because that will catch fire. Big, big yellow flames, lots of dirty black smoke, because it's a mixture of kerosene, petrol, diesel, and any other muck I happen to have lying around(!) Those were in plastic bags in front of the explosive charge. The explosive charge is just there to propel the fuel out, vaporise it, make a big cloud of it, which can then be ignited. So the visual effect is from the cloud of fuel igniting. And the explosive is just used to create that cloud. This is detonating cord. It's a thin plastic tube with some fibre winding inside it, but, down the very centre, it's powdered PETN pentaethyle tetranitramine, a high explosive. And when this stuff goes off, it will detonate along its length. That's about six kilometres a second. So it's pretty powerful. But, what we're going to do for the Hollywood effect, is to reel it up, and make like little flat pads of it. When that detonates, the blast from it will fracture the plastic bag and spread the fuel out and create our cloud of vapour that we want to ignite. The important thing to remember is when you're using things like detonators, or the high explosives in a mortar pot, you need to separate it from the actual steel pot. Because the shock waves from the high explosive going off can actually travel into the steel and actually peel bits of it off and create fragmentation. So you need to put a lump of foam between the explosive and the mortar pot to make sure that it doesn't break up and damage the actors you might have close by. With all the explosives in place, the second trick is how you film it. By moving the camera back and zooming in, you make it look like your actor is much, much closer to the explosion and it means the whole frame is filled up while everyone's still at a safe distance. Then, you shoot in slow motion. You make the explosion seem even longer by shooting from multiple angles and repeating it several times, and use all the cinematic lens and colour tricks you can to make it look... well, more cinematic. And you tell your actor not to flinch. [long, repeated, slow explosive blasts] Also, you hope he doesn't give a cheesy grin to camera. Like, we had one take, and what I did was... I should've done sort-of cold steel glare down the camera. I just had a grin on my face cause I'm firing a thing! Did that work? I was looking this way. I really wanted to look at the explosion. Oh, there is... there is a lot on fire back there, isn't there. Wow."
20,Why 18th-Century Firefighters Let Some Buildings Burn,"Across the UK, we take it for granted that if a fire breaks out you can call an emergency number, firefighters will arrive, they'll do their best to save lives and put out the fire, and you will not get sent a bill for making that call. Sure, if some movie director has arranged a massive pyrotechnic stunt for a movie and they need firefighters standing by just in case something goes wrong, they'll probably pay for the time there, but in everyday life, firefighters are funded by government, through taxes, for everyone. But that's not always been the case. The Great Fire of London in 1666 lasted for four days. The idea of ""firefighters"" hadn't really been invented at that point. The Great Fire was only stopped by a change in the wind, and by the military blowing up houses to create a firebreak. The whole of central London burned to the ground. Rebuilding took 30 years. The enormous monument on the site where the fire started is still standing today, 350 years later. After the Great Fire, the job of fire protection in London was taken up by insurance companies. Building owners would pay a fee for a few years' coverage, and the insurance company would attach a metal ""fire mark"" to the front of the building. Like... ...these, on the wall of St James' Palace. So in 18th-century London, if a fire broke out and smoke started rising, several fire brigades, each run by a different insurance company, would all rush to the scene. And then they'd check for fire marks, and only fight the fire if they saw their own company's mark, or the mark of a company they had an agreement with. If the building wasn't insured, they would let it burn. Their job was protection of property, not life. If a neighbouring building was insured with them, and the fire looked to be spreading that way, well, they'd make sure that building was safe, of course. And it wasn't just London. There were similar schemes all around the country and around the world. If firefighters standing aside while a building burns seems immoral to you... well, there are lots of places where that's still the case today. Or where firefighting companies will send a bill afterwards, assuming that an insurance company will pay it. In places where there aren't enough people, or there's not enough political will for a government-funded fire service, that may still be the only option. In London, it wasn't until 1833 that ten of those insurance companies joined their fire brigades together to create a single fire service... ...still private. In 1866, the government finally took over and created the London Fire Engine Establishment as a public service. But that was only after another major fire. It took disaster, it took death and destruction, to move things forward to the point where you can call the fire service to save lives, not just property, and without having to worry about the bill. You can still see a few fire marks on old buildings around London and around the UK these days, although not all of them are original, some are recent reproductions put up for effect. Heck, those on the wall of the Palace might be reproductions for all I know. But fortunately, it doesn't matter, because firefighters don't have to check for them any more. That was going to be a really good shot of Buckingham Palace and all you're going to see is the traffic light. Don't know why I thought I'd be able to get a good zoom shot of Buckingham Palace from there. The road's closed, by the way. I'm just going to make that clear. I didn't just walk out into, uh, an active road. It's... It's closed off for pedestrians."
21,"Hill Hill Hill Hill, debunked, debunked","There are lots of places in theÂ  world which have the same name twice. Places like the Sahara Desert: well, Sahara comes from the Arabic for ""desert"", so that's the Desert Desert. Or the River Avon. Avon originally meant ""River"", so it's the River River. There are a few triple namesÂ  like that in the world, but this, Torpenhow Hill in the LakeÂ  District, in north-west of England, is the only place in the world withÂ  four words that all mean the same thing. Tor, Old English for hill. Penn, Old Welsh for hill, How, Old English for a slightlyÂ  different kind of hill, and finally modern English, hill. I know it's not a massivelyÂ  impressive place, but the name's good. Except that's a story that'sÂ been debunked quite a few times. Double and triple place namesÂ  are a thing, that's true. They tend to happen becauseÂ  centuries ago locals would name the nearby hill, or river, orÂ  mountain, or desert, the obvious name, like, ""the hill"", and then when folks with other languages arrived, for trade or conquest or exploration, they added their word for it as well. But the trouble here is: there is noÂ  Torpenhow Hill marked on any official map. The name's almost certainly a modern invention. Someone noticed the village ofÂ  Torpenhow about a mile away, and spotted the three words for hill there, and decided to add the modernÂ  English ""hill"" to it as well. And: tor, penn, and how all have moreÂ  complicated definitions than ""hill"". It's not really ""hill hill hill"", that village, you can plausibly translate ""torpenhow""Â  as, well, the land the village sits on: a small rise jutting outÂ  from a much bigger incline. This is just a bump on theÂ  side of an actual big hill. I don't have a drone with me, butÂ  Google Earth shows it well enough. Also... the village's name isÂ  ""Trepenna"". It's spelled ""Torpenhow"", but the local pronunciation is ""trepenna"". So you can tell who's done the research whenÂ  this is mentioned in a list of weird place names. In reality, there's justÂ  the village of ""Trepenna"". Tor-pen-how Hill doesn't exist. That's the debunk. And so now, I'm going to debunk the debunk. Because if that's true, why am I outÂ  of breath? What did I just climb? I came up here from the village, it'sÂ  a slow steady climb on a country road. The land around this point is lower, and itÂ  sits right next to Trepenna-slash-Torpenhow. Now, I'm not going to colonise the Lake DistrictÂ  and tell them how they should be naming things. But there have been plenty of touristÂ  attractions built around much less than this. A good map is like a good dictionary: itÂ  reflects the real world, it doesn't make it. If people will go to that one tree inÂ  New Zealand that looks good on Instagram, just because they've seen other pictures of it, they'd probably come to Hill Hill Hill Hill. People go to Four Corners in the USÂ  just to be in four states at once,Â Â  it's not too weird to think thatÂ  people would want to visit here. Sure, the village is ""Trepenna"",Â  but this can be Torpenhow Hill, if enough people want it to be. And the thing is: as I record this, if youÂ  type ""Torpenhow Hill"" into online maps... quite a few of them point you here. Actually, just over there, I'll CG in aÂ  giant map marker just to make my point. The only thing stopping thisÂ  officially being ""Torpenhow Hill""Â Â  is that there's not enough consensus. So who decides that? Because I do worry aboutÂ  coming to places like this. This is a public footpath, I didn'tÂ  have to ask permission to be here, but I have a duty of care to the locationsÂ  I visit, and to people who live there. That one tree in New Zealand is beingÂ  slowly destroyed by tourism and by vandals. Now, ""Trepenna"" is far enough offÂ  the tourist trail so, probably, only a few geography nerdsÂ  will bother to trek out here. But if this did start becoming popular, ifÂ  tourists did start arriving at Tor-pen-how Hill, I do wonder how the locals in theÂ  quiet little village would feel. Because the signpost thatÂ  says this is a public footpath has mysteriously disappeared since the lastÂ  time the Google Street View car came by. I'm not saying anyone destroyed it, I'm just saying no-one's bothered to replace it. So as for how the locals feel? I probably shouldn't bother them by asking."
22,Five Things You Can't Do On British Television,"I grew up in the age of linear television, when most people in Britain had aÂ  choice of only four or five channels and when a lot of the nation watchedÂ  the same shows at the same time. And when a medium has that much power, it gets regulated heavily. Some of those regulations are sensible, and some do sound a bit strange if you've never heard of them before. I'm not including things that break other laws, or anything vague like ""cause offense""Â  that's true basically everywhere, just with a different definitionÂ  of what ""offense"" means. These are things that you can publish on YouTube, that you might well be able to broadcastÂ  in other countries in the world, but that you cannot do on British television. Any demonstrations of hypnosis on stageÂ  must be licensed: and that's still true. The fine for unlicensedÂ  stage hypnosis can be Â£1,000. Local councils still regulate that. Because back in the 50s, that was a concern. Hypnosis was a bit scary. To the point where there was a glut of lowÂ  budget horror movies about hypnotic possession. So stage hypnosis was licensed,Â  and television hypnosis was banned. Now these days, that regulation isn'tÂ  there because they're worried about some evil hypnotist taking overÂ  the world through the television, although that was a plot point in terrifyingÂ  90s kids show The Demon Headmaster. Although, let's just say that childÂ  actors have got a bit better direction in the years since then. ""I don't get it. I really Do Not Get It."" But better safe than sorry. If you did broadcast a hypnoticÂ  induction to millions of people, then the chances are thatÂ  someone is going to believe that it's done them some damage. Except. You can absolutely getÂ  away with that if you're careful. In 2009 illusionist Derren Brown performed a stunt in which he played out a ""subliminal film"" which he claimed would makeÂ  some of the folks watching feel like they were stuck toÂ  their chair. He also said: ""The film is not effective at a lower resolution, ""so if it gets posted onÂ  the internet it won't work."" Which is ludicrous. British television was low-bitrateÂ  standard-definition digital by then anyway. Those are lies. But they are a magician's lies,Â  so they're part of the show. ""...find yourself stuck, locked, glued,Â  gelled, cemented, bonded, fused..."" That's a textbook hypnotic induction technique. I mean that literally, IÂ  checked a hypnosis textbook. And there's almost two minutes of it, complete with slow-eye contact zoom! But he didn't say it was hypnosis. He never claimed to be hypnotizing people. He's just influencing withÂ  some words and some wavy lines and there were only five complaintsÂ  about it to the regulator, who didn't investigate. But officially and legally you can'tÂ  try to hypnotize people over the air. There's a list of sportingÂ  events, defined by Parliament, that must be available on free-to-air television. This goes back to 1996, when paid televisionÂ  channels, satellite and cable, were becoming a thing in Britain. Those services had a lot of money, and in theory, they could outbid the free-to-airÂ  channels for things like the Olympics, and Wimbledon, andÂ  football and rugby cup finals, and, uh, some horse racing. So Parliament put a law in place: pay-for television servicesÂ  cannot broadcast any of those unless the rights are also available atÂ  a fair price to free-to-air channels. Although it also works the other way. Free-to-air channels can't lockÂ  up exclusive rights either, because that would be unfair to the paid... look, it's complicated and it's messy, and there are all sorts of rules to try andÂ  establish some sort of level playing field while also making sure that the WorldÂ  Cup final doesn't go pay-per-view. Incidentally while I wasÂ  researching this I found that other European countriesÂ  have a similar list of events and there are some wonderfulÂ  national stereotypes in there. Austria: World Nordic Skiing Championships. Finland: the Ice Hockey World Championships. And Ireland: the hurling finals. This all makes sense. Governments do not want eventsÂ  of national cultural importance, and those sporting events are that, they don't want those events to become irrelevant because they're only availableÂ  to people who can pay. That's not in the modern sense of fake news, although the regulations say reportingÂ  does have to be neutral over here as well, but fake news in the War of theÂ  Worlds radio broadcast sense. You can't risk someone flipping through channels only to land on your fictional news story and think there's been some disaster. You can see this in action in Crisis Command, a brilliant and ahead-of-its-time show from 2004 where three people are askedÂ  to deal with a fictional crisis as if they were government ministers. The story plays out throughÂ  fictional news broadcasts that use actual BBC reportersÂ  and actual BBC newsrooms. ""Britain is under attack."" So to get around the rule, theÂ  footage is always shown in context. Never full screen. There's always someone else in frame or walking through the shot sometimes. And the same happens in drama shows. A news report about the end of theÂ  world must always be in context. Now as far as I can tell no one'sÂ  trying to get around this lately. The last time I know of, or at least the last time thatÂ  something sort-of like this happened, was the now-legendary Ghostwatch, on Halloween night, 1992. It pretended to be a live ghost investigation hosted by genuine real-life trusted presenters and of course: it Goes Wrong. Now, it was introduced in context: ""Screen One presents an unusualÂ  and sometimes disturbing film..."" but if you missed that context,Â  well, it was a clever show. It knew how to use and misuse the medium, and it scared quite a lot of people. And it influenced a generationÂ  of writers and producers. Not technically news, though. Given the tabloid fury afterwards,Â  no one's made anything similar since, although after nearly 30 years we areÂ  probably about due for someone to try it. There are exemptions for channels with low budgets and small audience shares and for broadcasters who are just starting out, but even from day one, as an absolute minimum, 10% of a channel's output hasÂ  to have subtitles as an option. Once the channel's establishedÂ  that goes up to 80%. Plus, 10% has to have optional audio description. 5% must have sign language, even ifÂ  that's just added on a late night repeat. Accessibility should be a right and a legal duty and occasionally channels do getÂ  called out for forgetting that. Controversial opinion: this shouldÂ  be true for YouTube as well. Not for small channels just starting out, but I do think that if you haveÂ  the sort of YouTube channel that spends, let's say a decent amount of money, or a decent amount of time on-[Music] -it's like two dollars a minute maximum, or just a little bit of your time -[Music] ""Oh look at me, I've bought a Lamborghini!"" Buy some damn subtitles. Also... I could do a whole video onÂ  advertising law and product placement. I still intend to at some point,Â  I've been promising it for ages. But I do want to highlight just one specific rule: 12 minutes per hour. The maximum amount of commercialsÂ  allowed on all British channels. For some of the older channels it's even less, seven or eight minutes per hour. And that's it. There are a few other rules about how far apart commercialÂ breaks can be from each other  and how long they can be and occasional small loopholesÂ  for odd circumstances, but the big number is: 12Â  minutes per hour maximum. And that's not some rolling-average total. That's per hour on the clock,Â  which means that channels will juggle their schedule by aÂ  couple of minutes to fit things in. If there's a less popular show rightÂ  before a primetime ratings-grabber, that less popular show might haveÂ  no adverts in the middle at all. Sure, they might still take a break, show a couple of trailers for their own channel that don't count towardsÂ  that big time on the clock, but the schedulers will make sure that there's as much advertising as possible just before the top of theÂ  hour, just before the big show, and then just after the top of the next hour. There is an art to fitting all that in, and out of all these rules, this is the one thing thatÂ  you cannot get away with. The regulator checks. They will notice and many channels have been pulled up on it. But there was one thing that I didÂ  notice while I was researching this. There is one other line inÂ  those rules which says that commercial breaks must be taken in a way that doesn't disrupt the flow of the program. I explicitly rules out that WhoÂ Wants To Be A Millionaire trick where someone has just chosen their answer, and it's all dramatic, and the host says... ""Time for a break."" Like, it's really clear that's not allowed. There's no other way to read that sentence. But the show's hosts have beenÂ  doing that for 20 years now and they've never been called on it. There are some rules, apparently,Â  where entertainment can come first."
23,My unlicensed hovercraft bar is technically legal,"In England, if you want to sell alcohol to the public, you need a licence. You can't just set up a bar or a pub anywhere. And the law about that is set down in the Licensing Act 2003. There are a lot of details in there, including some exceptions. For example, section 173 makes it clear that as long as you're ""on a journey"", you do not need a licence to sell alcohol aboard a train, a plane... ..or a hovercraft. Anybody can go fast, but when you come to the first corner, that's when you're gonna get ejected. It's like drifting cars. It's all about steering, a hovercraft. Not about going fast, it's learning how to steer them. The thing is with hovercraft: if you're looking at it, you're likely to hit it! In a hovercraft, to fly them, you do lean with them,â which makes the craft pitch and makes it turn.ââ So, if you're serving out the back of one, and you lean to give it to someone, might cause some interesting... control of the hovercraft, but it's all part of the fun(!) Yeah, you'll be fine in the back of there.â We'll just keep it straight as we can and serve your customers. And you might think: ""Tom, you're just doing this for show, aren't you? ""You're not actually selling alcohol to people?"" Wrong! This is a real beer pump. There is real beer being fed into it. And this is a working contactless card reader. It is connected to a company bank account. It is absolutely taking payments. Right. Let's do this. I did try to do my piece to camera on the hovercraft.ââ You couldn't hear a thing. So I'm gonna explain in voiceover how this all worked,ââ in between the bits where I have to shout at people. Full disclosure: there are only trusted friends buying alcohol today, both for safety, and because while the selling alcohol part does appear to be legal, I'm pretty sure there are several other Trading Standards laws that I'm only vaguely following. Don't take this as legal advice. But yes, the contactless card reader really did work.â â And yes, that is a terrible half pint of beer. There was a sparkler along the tap, and the whole thing had been jostled and vibrated by the hovercraft. Yeah, that should've been the first clue that I misheard him. Â£1.50 was not the price of a gin and tonic. It was the price of a half pint. Another terrible half pint that's mostly foam.â â So as Marc the pilot tried desperately to counterbalance me... I genuinely don't know if he was expecting me to take that glass back somehow, but... Yeah, we picked that up later. Most of the foam from it got pulled onto me. Oh, and watch the plastic glass between my knees there. Yeah, we picked that up later too.â Note that I'm using a thimble measure for the gin there.ââ Free pour of spirits for drinks like that isn't legal in the UK.â You're fine if it's a complicated cocktail, but for something simple like gin and tonic, legally, you have to measure it out. And remember, we've got to keep moving, at least slightly.ââ The exemption only works if the hovercraft is ""on a journey""... even if that journey is back and forth across a hovercraft racetrack. I did not bring a change of clothes.ââ I drove home smelling faintly of gin and tonic.ââ Yeah, the hover martini was just gin and vodka on ice.â And some grass that got kicked up by the hovercraft's fans. I am not a good bartender. And I am amazed by how good Marc the pilot was at flying the hovercraft in a strong wind. He's a hovercraft racer, along with Rob who helped set all this up. And this is a track that is all curves and no straightaways.â There... yeah, there was a lot of grass in it.â So, the big question: Why does this law exist? Why is there this ridiculous exemption? Alcohol licences are granted by local authorities in England, and trains and planes travel through the whole country.ââ It's meant to cover selling alcohol to passengers. And while these days, there's only one hovercraft service, and it takes ten minutes, we used to have massive hovercraft that'd cross the Channel to France. The law hasn't been updated, because it doesn't need to be. After all... Who's gonna be ridiculous enough to sell alcohol from a moving hovercraft? Caption+ by JS* [https://caption.plus]â"
24,The tiny monorails that once carried James Bond,"Monorails are almost always bad ideas. The last time I said that, I got angry emails from monorail enthusiasts, but I stand by it. Yes, passenger monorails are quirky and interesting, they look like something from science fiction, that's why theme parks use them. But they're impractical and expensive, because every bit of track has to be either elevated or dug into a trench, and switches at junctions require physically moving the entire track. There are exceptions, of course there are, but for almost every case, a monorail is a worse idea than light rail, or trams, or even a bus. And that's proven out by the fact that almost everywhere in the world... ...does not use monorails. Except. I think I've found a good monorail. And it was never public transit. It was a replacement for construction workers with wheelbarrows. The Roadmachines Mono-Rail was invented in a small town just outside London in the 1940s. It was intended for construction sites, and it was in competition with tractors and dump trucks, and yes, workers hauling wheelbarrows. And it's a really clever solution: the track is made of prefab parts, so it could be set up just by clamping bits together like a giant toy train set. The company claimed that two workers could set up 100 yards of track in about half an hour. And because the track is elevated, it could work over mud and rough ground at construction sites where big equipment might get bogged down. The single rail means it can have huge tolerances: it didn't matter if things weren't set up precisely, if someone needed to set one piece of the track a few degrees off horizontally or vertically. The monorail just clatters through it all. And, sure, yes, the diesel engine is quite noisy, but it's designed for construction sites. Oh, and yeah, it's automated. At the end of the track, there's an automatic stop built in, where it stops, and waits to be sent on its way again. It can even split and merge tracks easily, because, well, that's easier to do that when the safety level is designed for bulk goods, not people. By 1966, there were 800 of these monorails in the UK. Some were owned by construction companies that'd set them up and take them down at each job site, some were installed permanently in factories and works. They'd been sold to 60 other countries, where they transported timber, or clay, or sludge, or even, at one place in Finland, fish. Basically, they could be used to move any bulk thing that could be loaded into a wagon. There were versions powered by compressed gas, and a couple of experimental battery-powered ones. And they showed up in a James Bond film: that futuristic space-age volcano-base monorail was the same type that was being used in construction sites around the world, just with a shiny passenger cabin added on top. But now, they are almost forgotten. By the seventies, construction was changing. Tower cranes had appeared, which meant that materials could be moved faster, and in three dimensions, across building sites that were getting taller and taller and taller. And specialised dump trucks were improving, too. In 1977 the last of the Mono-Rails came off the production line. But they were in use until at least the 1990s. Most were scrapped, but enthusiasts keep a few of them running: this one is at the Amberley Museum in southern England. It's not a regular attraction at this enormous industrial museum, but they have run it specially for me today, which is lovely of them. There are also dozens in a collection at Nantmawr in north Wales, including one that's been modified to allow passenger rides. It was one of their enthusiasts who told me about this in the first place. Thank you very much to Derry. It's not that monorails are inherently a bad thing. It's just that in most cases, there are better solutions. Sometimes, like here, they're the right tool for the job. Thanks so much to the Amberley Museum, and to David Voice, who wrote the definitive book on these monorails back in 2011. Most of my facts here are taken from his work, so I've put links and references in the description."
25,Would you swim in power plant wastewater?,"I'm about 30km outside ReykjavÃ­k, in Iceland. And yes, earlier today, I was swimming in power plant wastewater. Which is not something I'd usually recommend. If you were at a coal-fired power plant, well, even if you were just swimming in the water that had been boiled to spin the turbines and then cooled back down again, well, there are enough stories about coal ash contamination, with arsenic and mercury and selenium, that it would not be safe. For gas and nuclear plants, as long as the water's treated on the way out, you'd probably be fine? I think? It's one of those things where I wouldn't want to chance it. But that blue-white water is in the Blue Lagoon. Now, the management there are very careful about how they phrase it. They prefer to talk about the skin care and health benefits that they claim come from the silica in the water, but... yeah, it's geothermal power plant wastewater. Okay, a quick diversion here: most cities in the world have a cold water mains supply. There's a grid of cold water to all the houses and buildings, and it's heated on-demand when it's needed in each building. But Iceland is geologically active: in parts of the country, there are high-pressure reservoirs of hot water not too far underground, where underground rivers meet hot rocks. In some places, those reservoirs break through and reach the surface naturally. So near those places, it's economical to drill a borehole down into the ground and capture the superheated, high-pressure steam and water that come back up. There are two things you can do with that hot water and steam. It's not drinkable, first of all, it's filled with silica and other bits of dissolved rock, but you can put it in a heat exchanger, and use it to heat up fresh, clean cold water, and then you can send the resulting clean hot water down a pipeline to paying customers. And this is one of those pipelines! There is hot water speeding through this to ReykjavÃ­k. It doesn't actually feel warm, if it did the pipe wouldn't be doing its job, because the water only loses a couple of degrees over dozens of kilometres, but yes, hot water speeding through that. Icelandic cities have separate hot water and cold water grids. If your home is connected to that grid you don't need a water heater. So, okay, that's hot water. If you want electricity instead, you can spin a turbine using the high-pressure steam that's coming up, and generate clean power that way. Technically, you can do both, but pipelines are expensive and there's a lot of hot water around here, so often it's just electricity or hot water. Even a massive, industrial-size geothermal borehole will last a few decades before it starts to run out of heat, and when that happens, you can just open another one a few kilometres away. The old one will get back up to temperature sooner or later, the Earth is not going to run out of heat. Which means Iceland has a massive supply of hot water. High up on a hill above ReykjavÃ­k, there's this beautiful building called Perlan. It's got exhibitions about the natural wonders of Iceland and a revolving restaurant and an observation deck. But the big round things on the outside aren't part of the exhibitions: they're the enormous hot water storage tanks that the building was built around. Perlan is a water tower, just like any other you'd find around the world, except it stores hot water. There's so much of it that, while it's not free, it's very very cheap. If your house is a bit too warm in winter in Iceland, you don't turn the heating down: you just open a window and let some fresh air in. Iceland also has quite a lot of fresh air. When it's snowing, the pavements are heated up by hot water pipes underneath. Last time I was here was in winter, the lake behind City Hall was frozen over, the ice was strong enough to safely walk on. In one corner, there's a pipe constantly pouring a bit hot water into that lake, just so the ducks have somewhere to swim. And yes, there are natural hot springs elsewhere in Iceland, there are natural hot spring beaches elsewhere in the world, but ReykjavÃ­k has an artificial hot water beach: they just pump hot water into that lagoon to heat it up a bit. There's a hot tub down there! But this isn't power plant wastewater. It's regular water, like you'd get out of the cold tap in your home, just heated up in a heat exchanger by the high-pressure undrinkable water and steam that comes up from the boreholes at the geothermal power plants. The two never touch. So there's one loose end here: after that high-pressure steam comes up to the surface and gets usedâ¦ where does it go? Well, once it's cooled down a bit, the geothermal plants just dump the water out onto nearby rocks. Those rocks are permeable, the water slowly sinks through them, and over decades it will make its way back to where it came from. Mostly. When you're dumping that much water out, though, it will tend to form pools andâ¦ lagoons. Particularly when it's got a lot of silica in it. And the story from there is simple: someone went bathing in one of those pools, thought it helped their skin condition, and a few decades of construction and marketing later the Blue Lagoon is one of the ""wonders of the world"" and they charge more than â¬30 for a basic ticket. And I don't want to knock that too much! Because yes, there is some research that says bathing in geothermal water like that helps some skin conditions, and there is a big difference between wild swimming in a mysterious hot-water pool and bathing in a well-regulated geothermal spa that gives you a towel and offers in-water massages. But if you feel like being cynical, then yes, that is power plant wastewater. Whew. Iceland is beautiful. Bit wet. But beautiful."
26,The Part Of Britain That Rises And Falls Twice A Day,"Have you ever read a fact somewhere and justâ¦ not believed it? This is Newlyn in Cornwall, in the far south-west of England. When the British government's maps say that a mountain peak is so many metres above sea level, they are talking about this sea level, the average sea level here. There's a little hut on that harbour wall and underneath it, there is a narrow, vertical well that connects to the ocean. So the height of the water in that well is the height of the tide. The waves don't make a difference. So for six years, 1915 to 1921, automatic equipment and human tidal observers measured the sea level here, and the average of all those measurements became the Newlyn Datum, the zero point from which all heights in Britain are measured. The land here is solid granite stable into deep time, so it seemed like a reasonable place to use as a baseline. So that's fine. That's all sensible. The fact that I didn't believe is: this whole part of Britain, the whole Cornish peninsula for hundreds of miles, rises up and falls down by several centimetres, twice a day, measurably, because of the weight of the tides. Now if that was true, it'd be common knowledge, surely? And wouldn't it cause earthquakes every day? I read that and honestly, I didn't believe it, even as I looked round and started to find peer-reviewed papers about it. So I arranged to talk to one of the authors of one of those papers, a world expert on ocean tide loading and... yeah. On some days, Cornwall might only move up and down by three or four centimetres compared to its average position. Whereas on other days the movement might be seven or eight centimetres. So a total range of maybe even 15 centimetres. There's a horizontal movement that's about a third or so, typically, of the vertical movement in most places. So how we've measured the movement of Cornwall and other places, is using GPS, the global positioning system. And we can measure that distance very precisely indeed at something like the two or three millimetre level of precision. Now there are a lot of errors that cause a bias in this measurement that we have to deal with, to deal with the effect of, for example, the change in speed of the radio signal, as it goes through different layers in the Earth's atmosphere, and so on. But what we can do is we can make huge numbers of measurements of this. Our measurement of the average tidal motion becomes very, very accurate and precise indeed. So we measure that tidal signal, not just over one tidal cycle, but actually over a period of three or four years, maybe even as much as 10 or 12 years. It makes sense, I guess, that the weight of water would compress what's underneath it. A few back-of-the-envelope calculations and you can work out that there are gigatons of water moving out there, in and out twice a day. And yeah, at the most extreme high and low tide  this whole area can move as much as six or seven centimetres up and down. But why does it happen here and not everywhere else? The gravitational forces of the sun and the moon that are what's causing the ocean to move, and the tides, just happened to synchronise more or less in their timescale with the way in which the North Atlantic is able to move. It's just a little bit like if you have a glass of juice, but if you swirl it around at just the right speed, you can build up quite a big slosh around the edges of the glass. Whereas if you swirl it at completely the wrong speed, as it were, for that glass, then you get a much smaller amount of motion. Around the coastlines of the major oceans are the places where the tidal loading is generally larger. So around Western Europe, Greenland, and through to the Bay of Fundy around the Atlantic coast there around the Gulf of Alaska and also around New Zealand. So the reason it doesn't start causing big things like earthquakes is because these movements, although they add up to something appreciable and measurable by our new modern, accurate techniques are actually very small relative to the scale of the whole earth. But that's sufficient for the most accurate engineering work to need to worry about this problem. Thanks so much to Professor Clarke, I've put links to him and to the papers that I read in the description."
27,Britain once forgot how long an inch is,"Great idea, Tom. Film in front of Parliament. It's imposing. It's relevant to the story. It'll look great. It is covered in scaffolding. When you buy a tape measure,Â  that tape measure had to beÂ Â  checked and calibrated withÂ equipment at the tape measure factory. And that manufacturing equipment had to be calibrated by other calibrationÂ equipment at its factory. And that equipment had to beÂ calibrated, and so on, and so on, and so on, until at some point,Â  that chain has to stop, there has to be anÂ organisation whose job it is to say: ""you don't need to calibrate anyÂ  more. Here is the truth."" These days, that job's done at the NationalÂ  Physical Laboratory in the UK, or the National Institute ofÂ  Standards and Technology in the US. I've actually been lucky enough to visit both of those in the past, so I'll put links to thoseÂ  videos at the end of this one. The international standardÂ  for length is the meter, and it's based on unchangingÂ  physical constants: a meter is defined as how farÂ  light travels in a vacuum inÂ Â  a certain fraction of a second. Is that all in frame? I've got no idea. I can't see my screen. But anyway, ever since the mid-20th century, the international agreementÂ has been that an inch isÂ exactly 25.4 millimetres. Which means yes, the US and imperialÂ  systems of measurement, inches, feet, yards, miles: they're all basedÂ on metric now. But before all thoseÂ  modern standards were set, those systems of measurementÂ  were based on prototypes. Not 'prototypes' as inÂ  'early test versions', but as in physical artifactsÂ  which were, by definition, the length they said they were. ""The metre"" was the distanceÂ  between two marks on aÂ Â  platinum-iridium bar stored in Paris. If those marks somehow changed, then the definition of theÂ  metre changed with them. Before we went metric, BritainÂ  had physical standards for theÂ Â  old imperial units, too,Â  dating back centuries. There are references to variousÂ  standards all through history,Â Â  but as far as I could tell, the first prototype that couldÂ reasonably be called a British national standard was a brassÂ rod that was created in 1760. That standard was eventuallyÂ  set in law: in 1825, the yard, so three feet, 36 inches, was definedÂ Â  as being the distance betweenÂ  the marks on that one object, stored with the Clerk of theÂ  House of Commons, in Parliament. Nine years after that law wasÂ passed... Parliament burned down. They were trying to burn old recordsÂ  that were on wooden ""tally-sticks"", and the fire got out of control. That famous Parliament building, the one that's behind the scaffolding, it isn't some ancient castle: heck, the US Capitol Building isÂ  older than what's behind there. Only a few parts from medievalÂ  times are still standing: the rest was built during QueenÂ  Victoria's reign, after the fire. Anyway, all the standardsÂ  for imperial units were also destroyed in that fire. The âstandard YardâÂ  had been partly melted. Which meant Britain didn't haveÂ  any legal standard of measurement. But that was fine! BecauseÂ  the law also had a provisionÂ Â  for what to do in that case:Â  you make a new Standard Yard, defined by the length of a pendulum thatÂ  takes a certain amount of time to swing. Great idea. More than a century early, they were defining the measurements byÂ  physical constants! Just one problem: those definitions were wrong.Â  Or as the law later put it, ""by the Researches of scientific MenÂ  Doubts were thrown on the Accuracy"". Those Scientific Men wereÂ  the Standards Commission, headed by Astronomer andÂ  Mathematician Sir George Airy. That commission was in charge ofÂ  re-establishing the lost units, and their final report made it clear: the government had put aÂ  dodgy experiment into law. It wasn't accurate enough. So instead, the standard was reconstructedÂ  based on all the copies andÂ Â  other versions that hadÂ  been made over all the years, all the objects, not like tape measures, or anything like that, but the things that were one stepÂ  down that chain of calibration. So by 1855, a new physical yard hadÂ  been constructed, made of bronze, and the law was changedÂ  to define the idea of aÂ Â  ""yard"" as the distance betweenÂ  two gold studs on that new bar. There were a few other suggestionsÂ  in the commission's report: they strongly argued forÂ the decimalisation of units and currency, which wasn't successful for a century. But they also said that thereÂ should be a public version ofÂ the standards in every large town: not because they'd beÂ  perfectly accurate, but because it would make it really really obvious if a shopkeeper with a dodgy tapeÂ  measure was trying to cheat you. Those standards still existÂ  in a few places. In London, you can find them in TrafalgarÂ Square, in the Guildhall, and by the gate ofÂ  the Royal Observatory. So if you have bought lunch from, let's say, aÂ certain shop and want to check if your ""footlong sandwich"" reallyÂ  is a foot long, you can do that. And I did. So: was the new yard the sameÂ  distance as the old one? Well, it would be difficult toÂ  mess it up too much, there were a lot of copiesÂ  of the original to work from. But every time you make anÂ  analogue copy of something, you do lose a little bit of precision. Before the 1834 fire, the yard was theÂ  length of one particular block of metal; after 1855, it was the length ofÂ  another block. In between: well, you could take a pretty accurate guess, but that chain of calibration,Â  that source of truth, was broken. For twenty-one years: no-one knew how long a yard, a foot, or an inch actually was."
28,The Village That The Luftwaffe Bombed By Mistake,"This is the Linby Trail, near the little village of Linby in Nottinghamshire, in England. I'm filming on the trail because it'd be really weird to do a walk-and-talk to a camera on a stick in a little village. This is one of those stories about war where no one dies, no one even gets hurt, and, for a little while, there's this bit of light in the middle of something terrible. So, World War II, 1941. Britain is being bombed every night by the Luftwaffe. Over in Germany, William Joyce broadcasts fascist propaganda over the radio to the UK, trying to demoralise the British public. The press nickname him Lord Haw-Haw because of his affected upper-class accent. Sometimes, Lord Haw-Haw would forecast which towns and places would be bombed next, and he was eerily accurate. And on one of his broadcasts, he threatened Linby Docks. Dockyards were strategic bombing targets; of course they were. But Linby Docks aren't dockyards at all. They're these little streams that run through the village of Linby. The docks are just a local name. But Luftwaffe commanders had looked at the map, seen Linby Docks, and decided to waste some of their limited war-fighting resources on bombing something that, while quite pretty, was strategically useless. Oh, and they missed. The bombs landed a couple of miles away. No one was even slightly hurt, although presumably one farmer's field had some unexpected and rather violent ploughing done to it. It's a lovely story. It's part of the local mythos here in Linby. You'll find articles about it online and it's referenced on the lovely little parish map that is next to the bus shelter. And I'm really, really sorry to Linby, but I'm not sure it's true. Because if you look at the maps from back then, they didn't say 'Linby Docks' on them. Of course they didn't. These streams are so small that they are barely even marked on the largest-scale maps. If Germany was using maps that were that detailed and that precise, well, then they could tell that the docks weren't big enough to have any ships in them. And if they weren't using maps that detailed, well then the docks wouldn't be marked on them at all. Lord Haw-Haw, that propaganda broadcaster, he didn't actually give away secret plans or announce bombing raids in advance. Of course he didn't! The Luftwaffe didn't want to give advance warning so they could be shot down. So, he just lied or relied on reports that came back in the news in the hope that he would be right enough to convince the British public, who weren't fools. A lot of folks tuned in to him, a few million, but it was mostly for entertainment. There's an argument that rather than hurt morale, he actually helped British solidarity. And there aren't many recordings of him; there's certainly no audio of him saying 'Linby Docks' that I could find. The Blitz was logged in detail by all the local authorities and all the records were compiled. Hucknall, the nearby town, is mentioned twice, but Linby isn't mentioned at all. I searched through all the relevant local newspapers, they've been digitised, and they have no articles about any bombings near here. I even asked the local historical society, and they were wonderful, they went through a lot of documents for me. But there's nothing from the time that backs it up, just folklore and stories told from parent to child, from elder to youth, for maybe the last 80 years, which does hurt a little, because it's such a wonderful story. Now, if I present something like this to the world and say, ""I don't know,"" there's a tendency for certain overenthusiastic people to see it as a mystery and try to solve it. The only people who know for sure are over 90 years old and, look, no one should bother them trying to disprove or prove one bit of local folklore. Besides, I'm only in my thirties and I've occasionally had moments where I've recalled clear memories of things that evidence later showed me I have had completely wrong. But the bomb records are not perfect. Newspapers back then might not have mentioned it because ""Bomb Lands in Field, No One Hurt"" is not a story, at least not in 1941; it would be today. Maybe it did happen. Or maybe someone came up with a story once, told it as truth, and everyone thought, ""Sure, that sounds fun, let's go with it."" I am expected to provide evidence for claims, rightly so. But there are countless tales that never happened. We call them urban legends or eventually just legends. Did King Alfred really burn the cakes? Probably not. Does it matter? Over a long enough period of time, no, not really. I don't think something like this needs to be proven or debunked, even if it somehow could be. It's just a good story. Thanks to the historians and archives who helped me with my research. I have put links in the description."
29,How England's Oldest Road Was Nearly Lost Forever,"Depending on which archaeologist you talk to, the Icknield Way is described either as the oldest road in Britain, or more carefully, as one of Britain's oldest still-surviving paths. It stretches more than 100 miles across southeast England, and there have been people walking parts of this path since before recorded history. Parts of it are still in common use. I drove here on the Icknield Way for a couple of miles, it was just a regular country road. But parts of it were nearly lost forever. All over the English countryside, you'll signs that say ""public footpath"", or if you're also allowed to ride a horse on it, ""public bridleway"". These are formal rights of way, protected by law, and there are more than 200,000 kilometres of them across the country. Landowners do not get a say in who walks along those paths and it's a criminal offence to block them. The trouble is that some of those paths have been lost. Sure, they might have existed once, historically, the public had a right of way, but they're not marked down anymore. There's meant to be a definitive map, but it's not complete. It's almost like the landowners at the time it was drawn up might've had a say in what was written down. Back in the '50s and '60s was when the legislation was introduced to actually map public rights of way for the first time. But it was done on a local level, so there were definitely inconsistencies across areas. People understood the guidance differently or even in some small areas, there might have been local opposition that meant rights of way weren't recorded that should have been. So we've got an incomplete network. Despite the Icknield Way being thousands of years old, legally opening every last bit of it to the public took a lot of effort. Not just research, but also some fairly militant walking enthusiasts turning up at public inquiries. This bit I'm walking on wasn't marked on maps until the 1980s. As the 21st century approached, the government agreed that having these maybe-paths all over the country might be a bad idea. In the year 2000, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act opened large areas of country for open access for the first time, but at the same time, landowners wanted some certainty about the rights of way map. If they bought a piece of land, if there was a right of way on there or not. So as part of the negotiation, there was a cutoff date introduced and that was the 1st of January 2026, and that was basically 25 years on from that legislation, so we've got, you know, just under five years to find all these paths and put them back on the map. So now, under law, England has until January 1st, 2026 to find and log all its footpaths. And as with any project with a deadline that's a long way away, very little has happened over the last couple of decades. But with five years to go, the Ramblers charity decided to try and solve the problem using very modern tools. They asked thousands of people to check one bit of the map each. They were shown that square on the current OS map and they were shown that square on a couple of historic maps from about 120 years ago, and then we basically got people to draw on the difference, do a big spot the difference. We think we've found tens of thousands of miles of lost rights of way. This isn't about creating new rights of way, it's about recording ones that should've been recorded in the first place. Most landowners understand the rights of way network brings billions of pounds to the economy each year. We find a lot of farmers and landowners like to use that public rights of way network as well. That is a very... political answer. There are certainly stories in the last few decades of landowners intimidating or bribing locals or officials into just quietly forgetting about some paths. There are plenty of people who would very much like the public to ""get off their land"", and suddenly finding out that there's a right of way through your farm is often not going to be appreciated. They can only really object on the basis of the historical evidence. They can't object on the basis that they don't want that path or that path is inconvenient, but we really want to work with landowners. There's no point, from a walker's perspective, a path just going through somebody's garden if there's a way round that. So, you know, in some ways, the real work starts now and that's about proving that these paths were historically public rights of way and actually submitting them to local authorities so they can be put back on the map. England is approaching a point that's very rare in history. It started with the first concept of owning land, which was absolutely not some human universal constant. Then, through the feudal system and the idea of all land ultimately belonging to the monarch. Then, to private landowners and folk knowledge of footpaths. After all, when most people never went more than a few miles from home for their whole lives, why would you need a map of the footpaths? Everyone knew what they were, they were common knowledge passed down from generation to generation. But now we're in an age of GPS, of precise maps, and of the expectation that everything will be on some database somewhere. The process of defining who has the right to walk where in England has been going on for millennia, since before written history, but it ends soon, January 1st 2026. After that, the definitive map is set, and there are no mysterious maybe-footpaths out there. If the Icknield Way hadn't been marked, it could've been forgotten about. Either it exists on the map or it's gone forever. It's not often that you see a millennia-long process come to an end.

30,Why some remastered music videos look awful,"This video is sponsored by CuriosityStream and my own Nebula original series. More on that later. In 2019, a load of music videos that had been uploaded to YouTube in the early days of the platform were remastered. YouTube let the music labels keep the same video IDs, along with all the views and comments, so suddenly, all those old videos were in HD! And they look... well, it depends on the video. Smash Mouth's All Star looks awful. Now, there are some brilliant remasters out there. Wham!'s Last Christmas is now in 4K, and it looks spectacular. And that's because it was shot on film, full cinema quality, the sort of thing you can literally project on the side of a building and it will look great. Same with Freddie Mercury's Living On My Own, the remaster looks stunning. In fact, I think that looks better, because they haven't converted it to widescreen: they've kept it at the ""aspect ratio"" of old '80s television. Because music videos weren't meant for the cinema. They were meant for television. It's in the name: music video. So one of the first steps in editing will have been putting the film through a telecine, which is a very fancy way of pointing a TV camera at a film projector and saving the results to videotape. It is way more precise than your average movie-theatre pirate with a camcorder, but the result is that all that film quality gets crushed down onto a standard definition TV picture stored on magnetic tape. 480 horizontal lines in the US, 576 in Europe. That's it. Any more quality than that is gone. Editing on videotape is much cheaper and easier, though, and if you're putting the final version out on television, well... why would you bother with editing actual physical film, which is what you had to do back then? A few videos might have gone to that expense, if it was part of a big concert film, say. So the Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus  was played at the New York Film Festival, and you can see the cinema camera with its big, bulky rolls of film in the background of some of the shots. But the final version of most music videos were, well, videos. So for the remaster of Last Christmas, a team of engineers had to track down the original reels of film, and rescan them using modern technology at 4K, and then, they painstakingly took those 4K files and recreated every edit in the original video, frame for frame, cut for cut. Actually, they were only able to find seven out of the eight original reels of film, so there are a few shots in there where the only source material was the TV-quality music video. And you can tell, 'cause this is what an old-school, standard-definition, analogue signal looks like when you use world-class technicians to upscale it to 4K. It's not too bad? I guess? Living On My Own also has a couple of shots where the old '80s digital effects have to be recreated with modern tech, and... they're not a perfect match. And there are also a couple of shots that have been replaced, or the timing slightly changed, no idea why. But again, it's not a bad job. Now, there is a cheaper remastering option that doesn't involve recreating the whole edit from scratch: you can take the final TV edit from the best, cleanest, professional-grade videotape you can find, and upscale that to HD. A lot of remastered videos have done this. It won't be as sharp as the original film, but it will look better than people are used to. Which is what they've done with the remastered version of Bohemian Rhapsody. And look, I can see why record companies would want an HD version of Bohemian Rhapsody. It's iconic. It has over a billion views on YouTube. But this was not shot on film. It was recorded on TV cameras, edited on videotapeâ you can tell by the look of the lightingâ and by the fact that these effects required live feedback to the camera. you could only get this by pointing a television camera directly at a monitor, which means there was never any high-quality film version, this was only ever in standard definition. And remember, old-school analogue television in Europe runs at 50 frames a second. 60 in the US, but 50 in Europe. Half of the horizontal lines get skipped each time, which is called interlacing. And it means you get less flickering on old equipment. So if you want the authentic, original experience, as seen back in the '70s, then Bohemian Rhapsody should be played at standard definition, at 50 interlaced frames a second. That's what was recorded. Instead, what you see on YouTube is a computer's best effort to make a high-definition, 25 frame a second, film-like picture from that limited data, filling in the gaps, turning jagged edges into smooth lines. That's called 'deinterlacing' and it's not done badly here. 'Remastering' doesn't mean 'restoration'. It means 'recreation'. You'll see marketing blurbs saying remasters are ""the way it was meant to be seen"". Which is a great tagline, but... no, it wasn't. Remastering is, to an extent, changing the historical record. There are fan remasters of Bohemian Rhapsody out there, upscaled from VHS, 50 frames a second, that are much more true to the original. But at least Bohemian Rhapsody got a decent HD remaster. It's not like what they've done to Smash Mouth. Look at his face in this scene. That's not a clear high-definition picture, that's some kind of demon child! It's scaled up wrongly, it's over-sharpened. Look at the diagonal lines here, they're jagged and stepped. I tracked down a standard-definition version from years ago that someone had reuploaded, and... yeah, I can see why a computer would do that. And, oh yeah, it's badly deinterlaced in some parts too, because here, you can see the cheerleader is in two places at once in the same frame. It's not bleed-over from the next frame either. She's in two different places there as well. Same for this scene with the dancer. Why is there a dancer in just one scene in this music video? But those deinterlacing artifacts, I don't understand how they're even possible. Did they shoot some of this on a TV camera at 60 frames a second and then grade it to look like film? That doesn't make any sense, but that's the only way that those artifacts could happen. But other parts look fine, and look like they're on film at 30 frames a second! And the parts that they pulled from the movie that it was a tie-in to â Mystery Men â those run at 24 frames a second, and you can see in this transition, the right side is badly deinterlaced with a ghost image and the left side has every fifth frame doubled so the frame rates match. Iâ Iâ I genuinely cannot understand what has happened here. It is a complete and utter mess. Presumably some underpaid and overworked VFX tech was given a low-quality, already-broken copy of it and told: ""It's just Smash Mouth, we don't care. Just make it work."" So they threw the video into a basic resizer to make it HD, massively dialed up the sharpness, and tried to squeeze the aspect ratio into... whatever this is. The HD remaster looks worse than the one it replaced. It's sharper, sure, but it's not better. And if you are going to change the historical record, it does seem a terrible option to make it worse. I've got an original series over on Nebula. Here's the trailer. I invited five people to play some games. I trust no one. None of us are trustworthy. ...in an environment designed to slowly break their team apart. This is real money! But all they knew is they'd be sat around a table trying to win real cash: $10,000.

31,Why this British crossroads was so dangerous,"This is Ipley Cross, in the middle of the New Forest, in south-west England. I couldn't find any official statistics for the most dangerous crossroads in Britain, but this is certainly a contender. Because even though it's quiet and rural here, there's not much traffic, there's an average of two incidents a year here. Two cyclists have died in the last ten years in near-identical crashes: both times, a driver failed to stop and hit a cyclist who had right-of-way on the main road. But the visibility is excellent here. It's well-signed. Actually, really, really well signed, now I'm here it's obvious there's a lot of road markings for such a rural junction. But people keep getting hurt here. So why is it so bad? For the research here, I'm indebted to someone called Bez. That's the only name I could find,  I couldn't track them down, they didn't reply to messages, but Bez wrote the definitive article on why this place is such a disaster. Let's say there's a driver approaching on the side road at around 40mph. They're not slowing down, because they're reckless, and they can see the main road is clear. Here's their view. The cyclist, until the very last second, was exactly in the blind spot caused by the driver's door pillar. The driver didn't slow down for the stop sign, which would have shown them the cyclist. They didn't move their head, which would have shown them the cyclist. The speed involved doesn't have to be some magic bad number. Because of the angle of these roads, for every possible speed that a reckless driver might be travelling at, there is a reasonable speed for a cyclist on the main road that'll keep them right in that blind spot all the way. But why won't the cyclist see the car? They have right of way, yes, but surely they'd notice that the car's not slowing down. Well, if these two roads were crossing at right angles to each other, yes, they would see them. Don't get me wrong, the driver would still be reckless, but at least the cyclist would notice and be able to take evasive action. But these roads aren't at right angles. There's one other subtle thing here: in this situation, the car is approaching from behind the cyclist. The cyclist won't see it until it's too late. And even if they do, when both car and bicycle slam on their brakes, simple simulations don't work any more . Because it's not up to trigonometry at that point, it's up to human reactions and how both of them try to avoid the collision. This junction is at the worst possible angle. And it happened by accident: you can see on old maps that this was just the angle at which two paths happened to intersect, and those were the paths that happened to become roads over time. This wouldn't be built nowadays: but at some point in the early 20th century, before it was possible to travel by road at these sorts of speeds, this was a reasonable junction. The local council has made some changes. Not only the paint: but you can see on Google Street View that the signs here used to be 'give way', not 'stop'. Stop signs are really rare in Britain, they're only meant to be used in exceptional circumstances like this, and almost everyone just rolls through them anyway. And they're clearly not working, because people keep getting hurt. So why hasn't it been redesigned? Speed bumps or a chicane on the approach would solve the problem, but it's not legal to have those unless you also have street lighting, which would mean laying miles of new electrical cable at enormous expense. That's assuming you could get around all the regulations that define this area as a conservation area, and the objections from the locals about putting bright lighting in a place famed for its dark skies. Same problem with a traffic light. The best solution is to stagger the crossing, to curve the two side roads so they meet the main road at right angles, force the drivers to slow down. But again: conservation area, conservative locals, and a budget estimated at around Â£100,000. The cheapest and easiest way to solve it, of course, would be for drivers to stop at the stop sign. But road safety, and anyone's safety,  shouldn't require faith in human nature. Thank you to Bez, whoever you are! The research for this video started with that article, so I've put a link in the description, please do go and read it."
32,Why dark video is a terrible mess,"The dark doesn't look very good these days. And I'm really sorry if you're one of the lucky ones who's never noticed this, because now I point it out, now I artificially increase the brightness on the dark parts in this video so you can see what the shadows behind me actually look like... now you'll notice. In movie trailers, in dark scenes in even prestige television, in YouTube videos where there are nice, calm gradient backgrounds: you see this dreadful colour banding. There are three reasons for it. And the first is that there aren't enough colours. ...all right, I'll turn the lights on. In most modern digital video, there is a grand total of about 16.7 million possible colours. And that number comes from how your screen works. When you watch a video, your phone, computer or TV takes that compressed digital signal that's being sent to you, and it converts it into instructions. Those instructions go to the screen, which changes the brightness of each of the millions of red, green and blue lights that make up your screen, up to 60 times a second, perfectly. It's incredible technology that we just take for granted. But those little lights can't be adjusted to any brightness. The simplest digital signal would just tell the screen whether to turn each light on or off. Each instruction would take a single bit, a single one or zero. So for each pixel, each combination of red green and blue, that gives you eight possible colours: two times two times two. Which doesn't look great. So, okay, let's add another bit for each colour. Two bits gives us four options for each light: off, dark, sorta-bright, and completely on. Now we've got four times four times four, 64 colours. Still doesn't look great. For a modern screen, you need eight bits for each pixel, so you've got 256 shades each of red, green, and blue, which gives you those 16 million colours that you're used to. That ought to be enough, right? It seemed to be, when the standards were written. And to be fair, every bit you add means more data to transmit and more expensive equipment. It seemed like a pretty good compromise at the time. Professionals, like people working in digital cinema, they go further, they might use ten bits for each pixel, giving them about a billion total possible colours instead. And you may well have a fancy screen that can show those more precise billion colours, but the picture quality is determined by the weakest link in the chain. A ludicrously expensive HDR monitor isn't going to fix the colour banding on that regular YouTube video. Anyway, it was decided that 256 shades each of red, green, and blue, combined however you like, that should be enough for most people. And for almost everything, it is. But at full resolution, this video is 1,920 pixels wide. And there are only 256 shades of green. So if I have a green gradient across the whole video, even if you use every single shade of pure green that's possible on this format, then you're still going to have a colour band every seven or eight pixels. And if everything's much darker than that.. suddenly you only might have half a dozen different shades of green available across the whole picture. Even if youâre using a bit of red and blue in there as well, there just arenât that many available dark colours. But if you've got  plain, bright background, why doesn't that have colour-banding all over it? Well, the second reason is how human eyesight works. There is colour banding all over this video. Right now. If we take a sample of the bright gradient behind me and massively increase the contrast, you can see it's thereâ¦ but normally, it's invisible. And thatâs because while the absolute difference between two bands is still the same, the relative difference is tiny. It's the same reason that this chart looks a lot closer than this chart. Going from 201 to 202 feels like a tiny change but going from 1 to 2 is a doubling. Even though in both cases, the absolute change is the same: one, we perceive one as being bigger than the other. But even if you don't have enough colours, you can break up gradients another way, you can use dithering. Instead of going from one colour to another at a line, you can steadily transition from one to the other, you can make the boundary fuzzy, so that from a distance the colours appear to blend. And if youâre filming a real-life scene, then thatâll happen in-camera, the natural light and the noise in the signal and the sensor will do that for you. And it actually works really well, it more or less solves the problem... but it won't look like that here. And that brings me to the third reason: compression. A raw HD video, uncompressed, needs somewhere around a gigabit per second of data. Even if you have an internet connection that can somehow support streaming all that, it's incredibly wasteful and expensive to use all that data. So every streaming service, YouTube, Netflix, everyone, uses lossy compression: a program called an âencoderâ takes a massive high-quality video file, and then throws away fine detail to save data. The more the video is compressed, the worse it looks, but itâll work on slower and slower connections, and itâll be cheaper and cheaper to run your streaming service. But at some point, the viewers are going to notice that the picture doesn't look great. But the encoder, the compression software, is written by very clever people: and it works out which bits of the scene the viewer is probably going to be interested in, and puts most of its effort into making that part look good. And thatâs usually a bright, sharp part of the scene, something well lit and in focus, and probably the bits that are moving. Now there are exceptions, where there's some slow, menacing threat out of focus in the background, but for almost every scene, if itâs dark, or out of focus, chances are the director and the viewer doesn't care about it. So the encoder doesnât care about it either: if there are only fifty kilobits, fifty thousand ones and zeros available to describe each frame of video, then the encoder will make sure that most of those are spent on where the viewer's likely to be looking. All that dithering, all the fancy stuff in the background? Too expensive. Smear it out into just big blocks of solid colour, no-one'll notice. And we won't. Unless it's also very dark. At which point, there will be something nasty lurking in the shadows."
33,Why you can't buy Dasani water in Britain,"This is a bottle of Dasani, Coca-Cola's brand of bottled water. It is basically Coke without the syrup: like most American bottled water, it is tap water that's been purified and then had tiny amounts of minerals deliberately added back into it. Except... not quite. This is a British Dasani bottle from 2004, which was the first and last time that you could ever buy Dasani water in the UK. And the story of why it failed here is one of the greatest marketing disaster stories in history. But it wasn't until I started researching, searching through newspapers and TV shows from 2004, that I found that the tale is a little more complicated than I thought. And a little more complicated than a lot of the world thought. And it starts years earlier. Through most of the 1980s, ""bottled water"" was something expensive that got ordered at fancy restaurants, and it was only by the early 90s that it had started to become a thing that everyday people might want to buy. On Christmas Day, 1992, British sitcom 'Only Fools and Horses' made fun of that trend by having its main character, lovable rogue Del Boy, sell tap water from South London as ""Peckham Spring"" bottled water. It's a slow and old-fashioned comedy by today's standards, and the episode is really weirdly paced, you're two-thirds of the way through before anyone actually starts bottling water, but because it was the Christmas Day episode in 1992, back when most British households only had four channels of television, that show was watched by more than 20 million people, more than a third of the entire British population. And the final joke of that episode is that the water is contaminated by some chemical barrels that Del Boy dumped in a local pond in the first act. It is, to be fair, a brilliant closing gag. And it's one that stuck in the British psyche. The BBC reran the episode another five times in the years after. It'll have been on cable and satellite channels many more times than that. I would guess that by 2004 when Dasani launched, about half of the country, maybe more, could understand ""Peckham Spring"" as a reference, or at least remembered that time Del Boy tried to bottle tap water. Now, under UK law, ""mineral water"" is a protected term. Mineral water must come from a certified underground spring, it must not be chemically treated in any way, and is generally under heavy regulation. And back in 2004, the perception was that bottled water meant mineral water. Why else would you buy it? It's something you can't get at home. Over in America, though, the home of Coca-Cola, the perception of ""bottled water"" was that it was just that: it was water, in a bottle. You were paying for the convenience, and the taste, and it didn't really matter whether that came from the ground or from a water purification factory. To be fair, there are large parts of America where the tap water does not taste or smell good, and their federal standards aren't great, particularly compared to Europe. And anyone who's ever taken a vacation to Disney World, for example, will know that the tap water around Orlando can smell a little... sulphur-y. But in the UK, the perception was different: you were buying ""mineral water"" because it was natural, [car horn] it had been filtered through rocks for eons, it was classier and fancier and, perhaps, healthier that what came out of your tap. That's rubbish, of course, we have some of the safest tap water in the world and did back then too, but advertising is powerful and the idea was that bottled water was filtered and pure straight from the Earth, it was somehow better. Coca-Cola were trying to introduce an American-style filtered tap water to a British mineral water market. Now, they were not lying about their water. Their marketing didn't use the phrase ""tap water"", they preferred ""purified water"", but they weren't lying. It says it on the back of the bottle: their process ""precisely delivers pure still water"". The public might have assumed it was mineral water, but Coca-Cola never said that. In fact, what they had done is spend a long time with focus groups, taste-testing and refining the mineral balance and the flavour of the water, making a version of Dasani that was ideal for the British palate. Dasani launched with the first stage of what was going to be a Â£7million advertising campaign on February 10, 2004. And... it went okay! For weeks. The British public either didn't notice or didn't care that it was tap water, just the way Americans don't seem to care. There were occasional rough patches for the launch, like shopkeepers in Buxton, a town famous for its mineral water, complaining about being forced by their contracts with Coca-Cola to replace bottles of the local water in coolers with Dasani. Or the regulators launching an investigation into whether Coca-Cola should be using the word ""pure"" on the label. But on the whole, it went okay. A lot of articles written more recently claim that Coca-Cola's first blunder was copying an American Dasani slogan, ""can't live without spunk"" -which has a very different meaning in the UK. But I don't think that's true. The only actual evidence I could find of that slogan is a screenshot on one tech news web site that liked innuendo. It looks a web designer reused some American ad images in one part of a Flash-based web site that almost no-one saw. No other article from the time, that I can find, anyway, mentions that slogan at all. Y'know, the advertising was put together by Coca-Cola's UK division: they're not stupid. In fact, the advertising team was probably breathing a sigh of relief. All things considered, the launch had been successful. And then it all went wrong, very very quickly. Exactly three weeks after launch, March 2nd, most of the major British newspapers simultaneously put out big stories announcing that Dasani was bottled tap water. Most of them mentioned that episode of 'Only Fools and Horses', and all of them made a lot of noise implying that it was a ripoff, although perhaps they didn't put it in quite so few words. And back when a lot of people actually read physical newspapers, front-page news saying that your product is a ripoff does make a big difference to sales. But why was it suddenly news, everywhere, at the same time, after three silent weeks? The missing piece of the puzzle is one journalist called Graham Hiscott, who worked for the Press Association. And as he tells it, as part of a brilliant half-hour documentary made later that year, he happened to be flipping through an issue of The Grocer, an industry magazine, at work one day. And that's an event that the documentary asked him to recreate for some reason. Now, The Grocer is an ideal source for journalists looking for the next story about a product recall or a weird marketing strategy. And that issue of the magazine had a feature on bottled water, and there was just one line in one article, describing Dasani as a ""mineral-enhanced treated tap water"". Which, when written so clearly, seemed odd: so Graham called Coca-Cola, and they said, yes, Dasani is treated tap water from the mains supply at their bottling plant: right there, in Sidcup, south London. Ten miles from Peckham, where that episode of Only Fools and Horses was set. A few hours after that phone call, there was an article on the Press Association newswire about where Dasani came from. Articles on the newswire don't usually go straight to the public: they go to other journalists first, who can use them or adapt them. And the editors at most of the newspapers correctly decided that, yes, this was something their readers would be interested in. Six months earlier, when Coca-Cola was setting out preparations for their Dasani launch, The Grocer had run a small article about it. And there's a line in there that's prophetic: ""one senior buyer warned that some consumers may be put off by the water's lack of provenance"". And now, ""Coke bottles tap water for a 3,000% markup"" was on the front pages. But Coca-Cola, and Dasani, soldiered on. That didn't kill the brand. They put more marketing budget behind it. They gave away free bottles in supermarkets. Another article in the Grocer from back then quotes Coca-Cola's UK marketing director: ""There cannot be many people who do not know about Dasani now... ""I cannot imagine how much we would have had to spend to get that level of awareness."" There is a theory that there's no such thing as bad publicity, after all. The final nail in the coffin was the contamination. They'd had a bad batch of calcium chloride delivered right here, it's one of the chemicals they used in the purification process, and tests revealed that their water contained above the legal limits of bromate, a cancer-causing chemical. There wasn't anywhere near enough in the water to do harm, but there was enough that it was outside the legal limit. So within 24 hours, every unsold bottle was recalled back here, and the shelves were empty. Just like Del Boy, not only had Coca-Cola sold tap water in a bottle, but they'd sold contaminated tap water in a bottle. Dasani never returned to shops. It never launched in France or Germany, like they were planning. And to this day, if you type ""Dasani"" into Google UK, you get results about the disaster, news reports from 2004 on the first page. Coca-Cola launched other water brands, of course, but as far as I can tell, they all look to be spring waters or mineral waters: they're not hooking up a purifier to the tap. Not over here. There are other folks selling purified tap water, of course, but that's usually the cheap option on the shelf. Not that it matters. It's all just water. And I reckon Coca-Cola could absolutely have made this work. Maybe they still could. There is a world in which one journalist didn't use the words ""tap water"", or another journalist didn't happen to look at one particular article, and where the launch went just fine, and Britain got used to the fact that drinking bottled purified tap water could be normal. After all, if it had become a popular brand, no-one would want to admit their purchases might be questionable: it's a lot easier to just say ""yeah, that's fine, of course, ""I know it's tap water"" than go ""hang on, I've been paying how much for what?"" and worry that you might have been ripped off. I don't think the Dasani disaster was inevitable. But it happened. And all that's left, sixteen years later, is a few bottles like this. Shame about the people honking, wasn't it? Yeah, right? Yeah! They might've... and I'll tell you what, we timed that well, because here comes a lorry!"
34,How Neurosurgeons Navigate Inside The Brain,"I'm taking a couple of weeks off and while I'm gone, some brilliant people are standing in for me here. First is Alex from Brainbook, he's a brain surgeon. There's nothing gruesome in this video, but there is the answer to a question I never knew I had, how do neurosurgeons find their way around inside the brain? Neurosurgery is fraught with risk. The brain is packed with almost 100 billion neurons compartmentalised into complex bundles of nerves and other structures that make you who you are. Small parts of your brain are vital for allowing you to speak, move, think, learn and love. As neurosurgeons, we operate in and around these vital structures and spend a great deal of time learning the anatomy so that we can operate safely. The room for error can be millimetres as we manoeuvre around blood vessels and critical nerves and damaging any of these can cause either life changing or life ending complications. No matter how good the surgeon and no matter how good their knowledge, we can still go astray and need a helping hand. Neurosurgery is a specialty that's inherently intertwined with cutting edge technology, and we can use that to guide us when we're navigating the brain. Today I'm going to show you how neurosurgeons can use infrared and electromagnetic image guidance systems to show us exactly where we are in the brain during critical operations like brain tumour surgery, or inserting biopsy needles deep into the brain. This is a Medtronic StealthStation S8. It's a combination of hardware and software that uses special trackable instruments, such as this pointer and this stilette. To be able to guide the neurosurgeon, the system tracks the position of these instruments in relation to the surgical anatomy and sends that information to the software. The software then displays the instrument's position on either the CT or MRI scan of that patient. The system can track instruments either optically using an infrared camera or electromagnetically. With optical tracking, this camera sends out and then detects infrared light that's reflected from these silver balls. The camera then transmits the instrument's location to the navigation software. Similarly, with electromagnetic tracking, the emitter emits a low energy magnetic field with unique characteristics at every point. The electromagnetic instruments contain sensors, which allow the navigation software to identify the instrument's location  within the electromagnetic field. For the software to display the instrument's location in relation to images of the patient, you've got to help the software by creating a map between points on the patient and points in the images. This process is called registration, and it's essentially the same for both optical and electromagnetic types. After registration is complete, whenever the surgeon touches a point on the patient using one of these tracked instruments, the computer uses the map to identify the corresponding point on the images. This identification is called navigation. And now I'm going to show you both systems in action. Here we've got an MRI scan of a brain model that we're going to use. Coming up, you see this white blob, which is supposed to be a simulated brain tumour on the MRI scan. Up here, you can see an eye coming into view, and then the nose. So this is the brain that's going to correspond with the model. In the bottom right hand corner, we're using infrared tools, and you can see the pointer coming into reference with the reference array that we've got fixed to the patient's head. We're going to be doing registration as we mentioned before, marking out lots of points with the infrared pointer. Now we can verify the registration. We've got 1.5 millimetre accuracy, which will do for this simulation. So, we're going to touch the tip of the nose on the model and you can see in the MRI that that correlates well. Let's look at the inner part of the eye and that looks good. The outer part of the eye and the tip of the ear, and this is all looking like it's corresponding really nicely. We put the pointer into this hole that's pre made, we're on the tumour, so that's looking good as well. And this is a pre made craniotomy or trapdoor in the skull that's going to allow us to just access the tumour straight away. In real life, we'd make this hole and that would take about 45 minutes to an hour, having cut through the skin and drilled off this bone. So we can operate around this tumour and see exactly where we are in the brain avoiding critical structures like blood vessels, nerves and parts of the brain that are important for speaking and seeing, for example. Now let's move on to the electromagnetic form of navigation, which is also called axiom guidance. We're going to be using a Rowena neurosurgical simulator and thanks a lot to Susie Glover from Delta and Stephanie Brown from NHS Healthcare Horizons. This model is quite cool because it actually has fluid systems within it and here you can see us actually scanning it and we're going to take these CT images and plug them into the software. Here you can see we've put the model in pins, but we don't usually do that because it can interfere with the electromagnetic system. We're going to be using this stilette to guide a piece of tubing deep into the brain's fluid reservoirs. This pointer is what we're going to use to do a registration. This is the actual catheter that we're going to be inserting deep into the brain and we'll take out the little metal stilette that comes with it, and insert the tracked axiom stilette that comes with the electromagnetic system. So now that catheter is tracked, we can use this pointer to mark out exactly what trajectory we're going to be using and see where we're going to need to make a cut and then later on where we're going to make a burr hole which is a small hole in the skull that allows us to access the brain. Now we're going to mark it with a red marker in this case and start drilling. [high speed drilling] Once we've made the hole and done a bit more work in real life, we're ready to put the catheter in. On the right so you can see that the StealthStation is showing us how far we need to go and shows us a target that we've pre-planned. We're going to follow that trajectory and make sure the green dots line up. As we advance the catheter down, it gives us a countdown in millimetres. Once we reach zero, we should be in the ventricle system and as I take out the metal stilette from inside the tubing, fluid should start coming out. And there we are, we are in. And in real life we'd now secure this catheter and get out of there. Go and subscribe to Brainbook, start with his video on a day in the life of a neurosurgeon on call. Next week, we go from brain surgery to settling on Mars."
35,I visited the US National Helium Reserve,"Helium is not a renewable resource, at least not on any human timescale. It's not a fossil fuel, but it is made very slowly by radioactive decay deep down in the ground. So in terms of managing it, we should be treating it like a fossil fuel. Once it's pulled up from the ground, used, and dispersed into the atmosphere, it is ludicrously expensive to recover. And over time, that dispersed helium is light enough and unreactive enough that eventually, very, very slowly, it escapes off into space, which is a problem because helium is enormously useful. We use it in all sorts of science and medicine, to keep the magnets in MRI machines cool, in manufacturing processes, and, yes, to inflate blimps and party balloons. And over the last decade or so, there have been a lot of breathless news articles proclaiming that the world is running out of helium. A lot of the world's helium comes from under the Great Plains of the USA. And here in Amarillo, Texas, the US government has the National Helium Reserve. At least, they do for now. We're standing on top of the Bush Dome, the reservoir that acts as the storage reservoir, which is approximately 3,500 feet underground. As a sponge absorbs water and holds that water in the sponge, similarly, the small pores in the rock are spaces where the helium can reside. It's solid rock to the eye, but it is porous and allows the gas to be stored very efficiently underground. This reservoir was a natural gas reservoir. It was depleted, then recharged in the sixties with 32 billion cubic feet of helium into the ground. So it's actually helium that we've injected previously that we're extracting now. The whole program was to conserve the helium for about 100 years of the consumption rate then. Of course, helium has become such a popular element, it has so many uses, that now, that rate is quite a bit more than originally estimated. That helium has been withdrawn over approximately 15 years. And we are now reaching the end of our program as the field is declining in pressure. Helium is notoriously known for being able to escape through any small opening. It's used as a leak detection substance. You can detect helium very easily. And if it's able to get out, you have a hole somewhere in that device or product. By putting it back in the ground, it's not leaking out of a stainless steel container or a big truck, it's easily monitored and controlled. The plant here is in its annual week of maintenance right now, which is one of the reasons I'm allowed to get quite this close. There are still parts I'm not allowed to show you, though. The equipment behind me is actually an enrichment unit. All that gas that was stored in the ground has mixed and blended with natural gas from the field, and it's no longer in an enriched state. So by bringing it through the equipment, we take that gas back up to approximately 80% purity of helium, about 20% impurity of nitrogen. That's what we produce and send up our 425-mile pipeline to the private helium plants that then take it to 100%. There are places in the world that are running out of helium, that's correct. But there's still approximately 80 to 100 years' worth of known helium reserves in the United States, in Wyoming. So to say that we're running out of helium is actually a little bit incorrect. There's still a lot of helium available and new helium sources being found. With the recent increases in the helium price, that's actually stimulated industry to go look for more helium resources. And they have found more. So we expect that in the next few years, more of this helium will be brought to market. And the shortage will be alleviated, at least for a short period of time. Running out of something on our current planetary scale doesn't mean there suddenly won't be any at all. It just means that the price of what's left will rise higher and higher and higher until the lower supply meets lower demand, which might make some more difficult to reach reservoirs of helium under the ground worth exploring. That's capitalism. Because of all that uncertainty, the price of helium has been fluctuating a lot over the last few years. And researchers are often having trouble finding enough money to keep their experiments going. And yes, it's why filling party balloons is getting really expensive. We are now in the final two years of our program and facing the last part of our privatization effort. By the year 2021, we will be stepping out of the helium activity and transferring it to private entities. Surprisingly enough, the question comes up about whether or not we should be using party balloons. I happen to be a real fan of party balloons. So for my preference, I still am glad that we have party balloons. With the price of helium where it is, there's so much conservation going on now that the party balloons are actually a very small part of the market. We've seen now in recent years with the newer helium sources coming online and this great effort towards helium conservation that that's really had an impact in making more helium available for everyone. So I think the party balloons kind of got a bad rap. I did think about ending this video by delivering my conclusion in a silly voice by breathing from a helium balloon, but honestly, we do need to conserve helium and I figured that would set a bad example. So this... ...it's just regular air. I'm glad that flew away! That would've looked terrible if it hadn't worked."
36,The elevator shaft was invented before the elevator,"The world's first elevator shaft was installed four years before the elevator was invented, which sounds ridiculous. But inside this building, the Cooper Union Foundation Building in New York City, is the world's first elevator shaft, the first time a building was constructed to have a space for an elevator top to bottom. Because when this was being designed in the 1850s, the architect and owner looked at New York City just starting to sprawl wider and rise higher and they predicted, ""Someone is going to invent ""a safe passenger elevator soon."" Four years later, Elisha Otis did just that. But that prediction wasn't quite perfect. I think the remarkable thing about the Foundation Building is that Peter Cooper first recognised that he needed to build a building, and then that he would figure out what he wanted to do with it. There were principles that he was committed to. One was free education to the working-class people of New York. He established a free reading room before there were public libraries; also, the largest interior space in New York City in which to hold lectures and debates, also open for free to the general public. Peter Cooper's vision was both for a very radical, progressive institution, but he wanted embedded in the building radical new technologies and ideas. So, by this time, by 1850, New York City was still really, really crowded and dense. But the grid of Manhattan had already been laid out. The Manhattan grid was established in 1811, so everyone in New York City understood that New York City was going to grow, and it was growing, in the middle of the century, exponentially. In fact, the population of Manhattan would peak in 1910, and we still have not reached the density and the high population that the city had at that time. So, Peter Cooper knew that the city had to be able to grow outward, but it also had to be able to grow upward. And so, he knew the elevator was coming. At the same time, Elisha Otis, who we all know from the Otis Elevator Company, was busy working on not inventing an elevator, because the elevator had been in use for centuries to move equipment, to move goods. What Otis understood was that elevators would never be used for people until they were safe. So, what he was working on doing is to invent the safety elevator. That's happening in 1855. The Foundation Building meanwhile is under construction. So, Peter Cooper knew this was coming. The only thing nobody knew was what would be the shape of the elevator cab, and Peter Cooper bet on circular. Since it's the most efficient way, spatially, to put the most number of people in the smaller shaft and to carry them vertically. Little did he know that that was not going to be the conventional elevator cab shape. And so, this was the first elevator shaft that was constructed, we think, worldwide, certainly in the city, but it was not the first functioning elevator. And the elevator cab that was ultimately put in this shaft was square, so it was literally a square peg in a round hole. The building was renovated, really, from top to bottom on the inside in 1975. The architect, John Hejduk, makes sure that the round shaft is really floating in the space. And the other thing he does is he makes a companion elevator diagonally across the floor, which is a square elevator. Always thought that that was a beautiful way to allow architecture to speak across time. Peter Cooper's intuition that the shape would be round was not what the market would carry forward. When you're thinking ahead of your time, sometimes you will guess correctly and sometimes you won't. But taking the risk to actually invent something new and to build it into a building, I think, is really an innovative idea. Is it worth the risk of making that sort of prediction when it is basically just a gamble? Given what hassle a round elevator shaft turned out to be, was it worth it? Or would it have been better to wait and then retrofit a regular elevator in later, like every other building from that era? And here's a bigger question: What should we be designing for now? Not just in buildings, but anywhere. What's the thing that is going to seem obvious in 20 or 30 years but no one can see coming now? I don't know. Maybe you do."
37,Why Helsinki's library robots aren't important,"A lot of folks think that a librarian is just someone who checks books in and out of a library for you, but that's not true. ""Librarian"" is a highly skilled profession that requires a lot of specialised training. It's about helping people research and access knowledge, in whatever way makes sense. Through the 20th century, that knowledge was held in books and on microfilm tapes stored in central buildings in each town, like this one, as a public good, which is actually almost miraculous when you think about it. The modern public library is a revolutionary, wonderful idea. Knowledge and information should be available to everyone, not just the rich and not just the clever. In the 21st century, that's still true. A lot of that information might be online now and available through our phones, but in-depth research, searching out truth from fiction, shouldn't be just for people who are able to understand complex academic citations and referencing. If you don't know how to look something up, if you don't even know really what you're looking for, if you don't have the words, the librarian's job is to help you find out. In an ideal world that's what librarians would be doing, not pushing a cart and moving books around by hand. That's why here at Oodi, the new Helsinki Central Library, those books are being moved by a robot. This Oodi building was built last year, so it's a pretty new building and that's why we have a lot of new technology and new services in here. It has been said that it's like a living room for citizens. So, for example, in the first floor, we have a movie theatre. Then, in the second floor, we have things to do. For example, 3D printers and laser cutters and music studios, and even a kitchen. You can play computer games. We have VR classes there, and gaming computers. Oodi isn't that traditional library, so in the third floor, where we have our books, it's not that silent space. People can talk there freely. And so, we have a few classrooms for silent reading. In normal big libraries, there's usually some kind of returning machine that sorts the books to the right places. We have also that here. The customers can return books from the first floor, and they will come, using the conveyor, to this basement and they will be sorted by genre and language. That's pretty basic stuff, but we are in progress of further automating it. So, we have a couple of robotic arms, and then we have three mobile robots. Those mobile robots will pick up these boxes and they will be transferred by them to the third floor, where staff can shelve the books. Small part of books will be shelved by our robotic arm that will the put the books in shelves. And when the shelf is full, it will be transferred by those mobile robots. Then we have some plans to use mobile robots in nights to scan the books with RFID antennas, so we know if there's any books in wrong places. Those mobile robots that we are using are planned so that they can avoid collisions with people. If someone gets in front of our robot it will calculate new routes and find another way to get to the right position. At least at this point, there hasn't been any accidents or things like that, so the robots and humans have been getting together very well. And people are quite curious about them and why we have them here, and what they can do. This library gets a lot of press for its robots. There was even a design prototype with googly eyes that guided people to the shelf they wanted. But most people can read a map or follow directions. The real job of the robots here is the same as robots everywhere: automation. Don't waste the librarians' time with tasks that a computer can now do. If you think public libraries are just about collections of books then, yeah, of course they seem outdated. Public libraries in the 21st century can be where you go to borrow a book, that's not going to stop, but libraries were never just about books. They're about information. Free at the point of use, no price tag. They're about collaboration and communication. And about making sure that everyone can find truth. Most libraries don't have robots, but every library does have librarians. And they're what's important. Thanks so much to all the team at Oodi for showing me around.

38,What counts as the world's shortest river?,"This is the Roe River. And if you believe the hype, it is the shortest river in the world. And through the miracle of modern technology, the waterproof camera on this stick, I can show you the full length of it. All the way from the source, a crystal-clear spring in Giant Springs State Park, Montana, flowing down 61 metres until it joins the much, much, much larger Missouri River flowing to the ocean. Yeah, the river's just there. And it really is crystal clear: while I was setting up, someone came along with some bottles and filled them up for drinking water. I was off in Vidcon in Los Angeles last week as I record this, and I was having dinner with a few folks who make educational videos when I mentioned that I was coming here to talk about 'the shortest river'. And if I'm honest, the conversation didn't go well. They kept raising different objections, and seemed to get angry just at the concept. So eventually I looked up the dictionary definition of 'river' in the Oxford English Dictionary: ""A large natural stream of water flowing in  a channel ""to the sea, a lake, or another, usually larger, stream of the same kind."" First objection: this is man-made. True, the course of this was refined by people, but... ...so was the Los Angeles River and that's still a river despite a lot of people thinking it's just an overgrown storm drain. Although to be fair, the Roe River here didn't even have a name until the 80s when some students surveyed it and campaigned for it to be named the shortest river. The Guinness Book of Records did  eventually agree, at least for a while. Okay, said the folks I was talking to, but how do you know it's the shortest? That is a fair point. There have been long-documented arguments about whether this river is even the shortest in the United States... ...and there are international claims too, like this short channel between two lakes near JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ in Finland. And I was really skeptical before I got here, but yeah, now I'm standing by it, I genuinely think this is the shortest river in the world. It is a large, natural channel flowing in one direction to a lake. Fits all the dictionary definitions, unless you want to argue that it's not large enough, but frankly if it's large enough to drown in, I think it should count. You could try adding more specifics. Forget arguing about whether this is natural: how about saying that a river starts at a source, flows somewhere in a consistent direction, and ends at a much bigger bit of water? That seemed like a great definition to me, until someone pointed out that that would include waterslides. Every time we tried to nail down a definition, it slipped away. I'll be honest, I'm not really here to show you The World's Shortest River, because I   can't. Because there will always be quibbles about definitions. All the categories that we try to put the natural world into, to fit everything into maps and databases, all those categories have to be fuzzy. Mapmakers have known for years that, as with so many things in the real world, ""is it a river"" is not always a question that can be answered with a binary 'yes' or 'no'. There is almost always an exception to the  rule. The 'river' is whatever humans agree it is. The exact definition probably differs between languages and cultures anyway. And in the end, the Guinness Book of Records decided not to have a listing for shortest   river."
39,Flying a plane with fireworks on the wings,"I got an email from an aerobatics team that said, ""Hi, we attach pyrotechnics to our planes ""so we can produce a fireworks show in mid-flight. ""Do you want to come for a test ride?"" [radio] ""Going right, now."" What else was I going to say? Look at that sunset. Oh, wow. My inspiration for Aerosparx came from seeing New Years Eve on television, in Edinburgh, where underneath the castle they had a waterfall of light. I always imagined that being somehow trailing off behind the wing of an aeroplane. Aerosparx, as a display team, we are lucky enough and privileged enough to go all over the world. We've been to China, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, lots of locations in Europe, and obviously locations in the UK. And we can display from up to 300,000 people, to a million people. All right. It is nearly dark enough and our planes are nearly in position. This is going to happen very soon. Just to be clear, this is a practice run. This is not a proper display. When it's a display, there is a lot more going on in the cockpit, a lot more going on the pyrotechnics, and they are very much not allowed to take passengers. But, um, yeah. Let's see what this is like. And, relax(!) Are my nerves that obvious? One of the big wows is flying in extremely close formation. We're helped by the wings being extremely long, so your peripheral vision is just full of aeroplane. I don't see Guy very often, but I know that he's probably only three metres from my aircraft, and that's where trust comes in. You'll see us firing lots of different kinds of fireworks, pyro, from the aeroplanes. They all need preparation and that can take some hours. So all of the igniters, eMatches, need inserting into the fireworks. We need to work out what we're going to put on the aeroplane where, and then the process of actually fitting the aeroplane, again, can take half an hour to an hour. We genuinely can't shimmy down the wing and light the blue to uch paper. All commercial firework displays are ignited the same way. They're all ignited with a control box lighting an eMatch or an igniter. And that goes into the blue touch paper, effectively. And we do just the same. We started out by having a bank of switches. But when you're under high workload in formation flying, it's so easy to hit the wrong button. We can fire 24 separate fireworks in our display. You can't get 24 right in a sequence. So we've actually had a bespoke computer system designed, and not only does it fire our fireworks for us, but it also controls the LED light system on the aeroplanes  as well. And that means I now have only one button. So once I've pressed it once, it then auto-sequences onto the next part of the programmes. My imagination, I've found over the years, has always been a leapfrog ahead of the authorities' regulation. Not trying to stop what we're doing, but trying to understand what we're doing, and finding out where it fits into regulations that were written, quite genuinely, not for aeroplanes. So at the moment we're dealing with aviation regulation and firework regulation. [radio] Diving now. Loop now. Fire, fire, fire. Loop. Loop, now. Check your CB, Rob, check your CB. So the question is, how can they do this? And how can they do this safely? [radio] Loop. Loop, now. We have defined roles. My job is to lead the formation, lead the display. Rob is working very hard in the climb out, working out exactly where to start the display, and how to modify the display subtly to keep it in the right place with the wind conditions. My job is very clear, to fly safely and as close as I can without hitting him. Planning is everything in our display, and that planning starts on the ground before we even get airborne. We do a bumblebee dance, as we call it, so we go around in circles, in our mind and physically mimicking the manoeuvres that we're then going to do in the sky. And that then sets a cadence and a rhythm, and the physical memory of what you're doing, so that when we start a display, we're on the same page and working as a team. On the radio, we're confirming all the time what we're going to do before we do it. Okay. Firing now. Our choice of using a Grob 109 motorglider was for lots of reasons. One of my original imaginations of this firework display was to separate the fireworks as far as we could, and we needed a big wingspan for that. Because it's a glider, it also has the efficiency of a glider. Which means that we can perform aerobatics with a very small engine, and it gives us grace. The disadvantage with a motorglider is a very small engine. That means we take a long time to climb to altitude, and when we're at altitude, we try and conserve all the energy we have. We describe our as play as painting with light. We like to think that the focus is more on the image we're painting with the aeroplanes, rather than the distinct manoeuvres we're doing separately. Fireworks are great on the ground, when you're flying next to fireworks, it's even better. And I still pinch myself every time I even think about going flying with fireworks, and just think, 'I can't believe we're actually going to do this'. That's incredible. So that's, what, two tests now. And what are you doing tomorrow? Tomorrow will be twice as much pyro in the same length of time. So it's going to be Armageddon. Thank you so, so, much. Very good. You can find out more about Aerosparx and all the displays they're going to, at the link in the description. Thank you. What we are going to do is turn the engine off. Oh. And land as a glider. Okay. Um. Sure! There you are, look. No engine. The propeller's just... just stopped."
40,How to stop a colossal bridge corroding,"When it opened in 1981, the Humber Bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. More than 1,400 metres of road, weighing 17,000 tonnes, held up by cables that weigh thousands of tonnes themselves. Those cables are made up of more than 14,000 individual wires, all anchored into concrete foundations on the shore. And those cables, and the whole structure in turn, is held up by these enormous towers. The bridge is so wide and so tall that, while both towers are vertical, they're just a couple of centimetres further apart at the top because of the curvature of the earth. Nearly 40 years after it opened, this bridge is about a third of the way through its design lifespan, and it's time for a checkup. Back in the '90s, in the United States, bridge engineers started to unearth severe cable corrosion in their early structures. So, they were building suspension bridges in the '30s. The way that the cables were designed to be kept watertight was, once the wires had been spun and formed a cable and compacted, the open wires were coated with lead paste, which is lead and linseed oil. Wrapping wire was then added around the outside of the cable, trapping the lead paste and effectively keeping the cable watertight, and it was thought that would be sufficient. Inspections in the United States demonstrated that moisture was still penetrating and gathering in the main cables and causing significant corrosion, because, inside here was its own mini climate, in effect, so it was affected by external temperatures, day, night, winter, summer. This is a brutal environment for the cables. We're near the ocean, for a start, and down by the road there's engine exhaust and spray. Remember, the cables aren't one sold piece of metal. They're made up of thousands of individual wires. And while they're packed tightly, they're cylinders, so there will always be a slight air gap between them, and that air gap is the solution. Water-based corrosion of steel or iron cannot occur below 40% relative humidity. There's approximately 15-20% open space in this compacted cable. If you can keep that volume below 40%, then effectively corrosion is halted. Inside the main deck of the bridge, there are plant rooms that produce dehumidified air. That air is then pumped up to the main cable and injected into a stainless steel sleeve that surrounds the main cable. The relative humidity of the air blown into the cables is low enough to have an affinity to collect moisture as it travels through the cable, drying the cable and exhausting the moisture to atmosphere, and that is a continuous, 24-hour cycle, 365 days a year, essentially for the rest of the bridge's life. So, the Humber Bridge Board first inspected their main cables in 2009, and then deployed dehumidification the following year, 2010. Here we are, 10 years later in 2019, reinspecting the main cable to ascertain the effectiveness of that dehumidification system. What we do is, with a sledge hammer, we drive the wedges in to form an open wedge in the cable. From each wedge line, the consultant engineer will select a wire, and then our guys will come along and sample that particular wire and remove approximately a five-meter length to then take the data that they need to collect from the cable. We then select a five-meter length from the drum of the new wire and splice that in with ferrules and then remove the wedges, and that wedge line is then finished. That is then repeated seven more times around the circumference of the cable, and then that effectively is the inspection complete. With 100-ton hydraulic jacks in each corner, we compress the cable back to its original diameter. The idea that the wires are slightly corroded could be worrying, but it's well, well within design tolerances, and it's been noticed early and dealt with, and they're keeping a watch on them just in case. But bridges elsewhere in the world that aren't inspected, where infrastructure isn't maintained, where cutbacks mean that this isn't happening? Those should give you just a little cause for concern. The Humber Bridge is doing just fine. That works? All right. We're going to go for the drone shot."
41,Mr Olds' remarkable elevator,"Big industrial inventions in the 21st century are made by research and development teams at enormous corporations. They don't come out of somewhere like this, a traditional workshop and foundry that can still be powered by steam sitting in a rural town in Australia. And yet. A screw is a very simple machine, it takes rotational motion and turns it into linear motion so you can rotate this screw, the stuff down there will get picked up, and friction will stop it falling down again right away. That's called a vertical screw conveyor. And you'll find something like this in factories around the world for lifting and moving bulk powder or grain or sand. What would happen if instead of rotating the screw, you instead kept it still and just rotated this cylinder around it? My guess when someone showed me this was, well, nothing. The cylinder will just rotate in place, it's just a cylinder with a couple of scoops at the bottom. If you're confused by that, so was I. The Olds name came from Cornwall. My grandfather came out in 1868, at 18 years of age. Dad made his first engine, a steam engine, in 1906 when he was 16. And 1925, my older brother was born, he's still going, and [laughs] I came along in 1930. We served an apprenticeship under our father, unofficially, from when we were kids. We try to keep up with the times as much as we can, but using traditional methods. Just before Christmas, I think 2003, we had this new mixer that we'd bought. It was 20-odd thousand dollars and we had it set up where we were going to use it. Nothing seemed suitable for the elevation of the sand up to the hopper over the top, over the machine, and I woke one morning, three o'clock in the morning, with this crazy idea and made a sketch of it and went back to bed and went to sleep. And the next day I came to work and I said, I had a thought about making this. Nah, that won't work, they said and I said well, we're going to try it. It was only a matter of days or a week and we had the first little machine operating. We drove it with an electric drill. We set about making a decent machine then and we put it in the foundry. It did the job amazing. People were coming to have a look at it and I realised we should put a patent application in on it. This was so different I thought it'd be easily protected. Because rotating the casing instead of the screw you can see that it's different. We spent a lot of money on patent coverage. And the name Olds Elevator had been applied to it. And they're made in America and Holland and France and Spain. [laughs] You name it. With this elevator, it's a full flow. And there's no movement of air, virtually, except what might be between the particles of sand. So there's really no dust generated by the machine. Only where it falls back through the open air. This is also a very important thing where you're handling dusty explosive materials. Corn dust is highly explosive. Sugar. Big explosion in the USA a few years back and it demolished a refinery. The clearance between the inside of the rotating tube and the screw allows product to go through it and not be damaged, not crushed. It's a very forgiving type of machine because it can be in very poor condition and it'll work. It's been found that it's a more accurate volumetric feeder than a lot of the devices that are being used. This took a while to get my head around. Visually, rotating the cylinder instead of the screw, is very different. But from a physics perspective, it's really not. If you rotate the screw, it looks like each level in there is moving upwards, but that's just an illusion. It's just rotating horizontally. Stuff gets lifted because as the screw rotates the particles at the top of the pile are shoved out of the way and they prefer to take the easy route upwards through air, instead of pushing the heavy bulk below out of the way. When you rotate the cylinder, exactly the same thing is happening. The buckets underneath force the particles to go somewhere. And when they're pushed into the screw, they take the easy route up through air. And the next ones do the same and the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and everything keeps going up. They're taking the easy path. It is counterintuitive. And look, I am trying to not make this be an infomercial. I checked, and yeah, this is being used all over the world now, from food handling to solar power towers. This is a good new way of lifting bulk stuff. So what I really don't understand is, through the 20th century, a century of industrialization and automation, how did no one spot this earlier? I don't know why somebody else hasn't thought of it. In the USA, they were calling me Archimedes II. [laughs] It's different, it's useful, and if it helps people, well that's great. Thank you to Peter Olds and all the team at Olds Engineering. You can find out more about them and about the Olds Elevator at the link in the description. I am going to have to give you a hand clearing up this bird seed. [laughs]"
42,The brain-eating amoebas of Kerosene Creek,"It is very early in the morning and the air is very cold here at Kerosene Creek, a natural hot spring near Rotorua on the North Island of New Zealand. It's a natural swimming pool and waterfall at a warm and comfortable bathing temperature year-round because of the geothermal activity that's around here. There is also a questionable smell in the air, but fortunately that doesn't really come across on camera. This place is not the local secret that it used to be. Tourists flock here now, which is why I'm filming here so early. I didn't really want to turn up to a swimming pool full of people and awkwardly point a camera at them. But there's one view that I can show you that the tourists won't get to see because there's a rule here that the government warnings are very clear about: keep your head above water. The brain-eating amoeba can be found in hot pools and things like that. So these organisms enter the nose if you put your head under or you snort the water in. They can then go from the nose through the olfactory nerves to the brain. And then once in the brain they start to eat the neurons and astrocytes. And they cause massive inflammation. And then you get this horrible amoeboid disease. It starts sometimes with a change in your sense of smell, sense of taste. And then that can progress to headaches, vomiting, fever, and then ultimately to seizures and death. There are potentially a couple of drugs that are used, one of which is not licenced for use, and is actually very difficult to get hold of. So in general there is no treatment, and 97% of people die. Brain-eating amoeba aren't unique to here or even to New Zealand. They're common anywhere that there's warm, untreated water. There was even a fatal case at Disney World in Florida in 1980, back when they had a water park built into a lake. And there are more odd cases too. When you've got a cold and you're really bunged up in your sinuses, you can flush them out. It's really important, if you're going to shove water up your nose, because of the fact that there is this amazing-these many nerves connecting your nose to your brain, that you use only boiled water. And so there have been cases of people who've used neti pots just taking tap water. And, ugh! They... Brain-eating amoeba is not the only infection people have had. There are other things, but that is one potential thing people can get. But despite the terrifying name, the grisly stories, and the 90-something percent chance of death if you're infected, infection is really rare. How much of that is down to the government warnings though? Well, probably best not to have a control group for that experiment. Although, that said, the warning signs that were once here aren't here any more. So what are the odds of it happening? They're very, very, very rare. The last case we had in New Zealand was, I think, in 2000. But I guess the point is when it does happen, it's pretty catastrophic. There will be things that we're doing in our daily lives that are way more dangerous than this, even from a microbial point of view. We are covered in microbes, we have really nasty microbes living in us and on us on a daily basis, and most of the time it's okay. Maybe one in three, one in four people will have staph aureus living up their nose. Pretty fine up there, but if you get that in your bloodstream you can end up with horrible infection. You're more at risk, frankly, from shoving your finger up your nose and then touching a cut accidentally than you are from having your brain eaten by amoeba. Thanks to Dr. Wiles at the University of Auckland for all her expertise. Pull down the description for the references she used in her research."
43,"Where two oceans meet, debunked","Cape Reinga, at the very northern tip of New Zealand's North Island, is one of the few places in the world where you can watch two oceans collide. So say the guidebooks, anyway. The truth is a little more complicated. First of all, you can find photos online like this. I took that from a kayak in Svalbard, up in the Arctic. Two very different coloured waters separated by a bit of foam. People online claim that photos like it show one of the few places in the world where two oceans meet but don't mix, but no. That's just where a river is washing fresh water filled with sediment out into the sea. The truth of where two oceans meet is just not that dramatic. Here, at least, you can see the waves from the Tasman Sea coming in from the west and clashing with the Pacific Ocean waves from the east. Right? No. Ocean currents and waves have many causes: the weather, water temperature, water salinity -how much saltâs in there. And theyâre three-dimensional. Now, with all the complicated geography and wind here at the very tip of the country: of course itâs chaotic down there, it's turbulent, of course you have different sets of waves meeting, but those are local effects. As soon as you get away from land, the water here will become part of the massive system that's defined by global weather and ocean currents. And those ocean currents are measured in sverdrup. One sverdrup is a million cubic metres of water, moving at a metre per second, and the largest currents measure more than a hundred sverdrup. Those are amounts that make no sense on any human scale. While there are often currents here that might contribute to that particular weird wave pattern... this is just one very, very small bit of the ocean with waves that look messy on a human scale because of the land nearby. And despite what the guidebooks say, this isn't even where the Tasman Sea ends and the Pacific begins. Not according to the maps. The official limits of oceans and seas are defined by the International Hydrographic Organisation, and those standards are arbitrary lines designed to make sure that everyone can agree on whatâs where, so that weather warnings and marine charts describe the same areas no matter who's producing them. Those lines are nothing to do with the position of any ocean currents. And according to those standards, the Tasman Sea meets the Pacific at North Cape, a closed nature reserve about two kilometres that way. This is just a windy bit of rock with a lighthouse and a road. That doesnât mean you shouldnât come here, though. Cape Reinga is beautiful, itâs part of the local mythology, and itâs worth the trip. But when they say itâs where two oceans collideâ¦ that just isnât quite true."
44,How Auto-Tune Works,"A pure tone is a vibration of air back and forth at a certain frequency. And it sounds like this. [tone] If you want to raise the pitch of that tone, you can speed up those vibrations. [higher, shorter tone] But because you've sped the vibrations up, that tone doesn't last as long. Slow it down... [lower, longer tone] ...and that tone will go on for longer. Pitch correction, or auto-tune, is clever. When it changes a note that someone's not quite sung correctly, it changes the speed of the vibrations, but it also adds or removes some vibrations so the duration stays the same. Except that's not quite the full answer. Because musical notes don't sound like this: [tone] They sound like this. â« Hello â« â« Hello! â« â« Hello... â« â« Hello~ â« Ladies, gentlemen, and all in between, the Gregory Brothers. â«                                     â« Oh yeah, some talent's still require~d â« [effects and auto-tune fade out] [note continues] [gasps] I know we're wandering off, but I thought that sounded pretty good. That certainly worked for me. [laughter] That's good. It's a powerful note. That hurt! That actually hurt."
45,How to slow down a stock exchange,"A modern stock exchange isn't people yelling at each other to buy and sell things. It's a matching engine, a computer system that takes in all the information of who wants to sell, who wants to buy, and what prices they want, and then pairs them all up, and exchanges money and shares automatically as fast as it can. Over the last couple of decades, though, something called high-frequency trading appeared: computers trading on a stock exchange faster than any human ever could, watching for price fluctuations and reacting instantly before anyone else can. The faster they react, the more money they can make, so companies collectively spent billions on moving their equipment closer to or even inside the exchange, or building private microwave and cable links that send signals faster than anyone else. One of the strategies was to see someone else send a trade request and then get the same offer to the exchange faster, buy the shares first, and then sell them on for a tiny, tiny profit thousands and thousands and thousands of times. Each microsecond advantage could mean more profits. These days, though, so many companies have spent so much money to get those tiny speed gains that they're all trapped in a stalemate. They're all as close to the exchanges as they can be, and the signal routes are as close to light speed as they can possibly make them. When everyone's bought the same expensive advantage, no one's in the lead. There is another solution, though, and it's being used by another stock exchange a couple of blocks that way. IEX is now a fully-fledged stock exchange, so a lot of people obviously know names like New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. We're regulated and established the exact same way as those stock exchanges. We're one of 13 in the US. Sometimes, people will take the argument of 'high-frequency trading is bad'. What we'll tell you is, there's nothing wrong with those strategies, but different than any other stock exchange, what we've done is we level the playing field for not only those folk, but also for the slow traders, the human traders, and the only way in which you can really do that is actually, as an exchange, to slow things down. Generally, in the US, you're obligated to know what's going on in all markets, so the only way in which you can do that is you have to connect to all the other markets, you have to take in all these super-fast feeds, and you have to make a determination on the best price at that time. If someone can take in that information quicker than the exchange they're trading on, then they can pick off people trading on that exchange before the exchange even knows what the new price is. We can take in all that data, we can make a determination on what the fairest price is, and as long as someone is not 350 microseconds faster than us, we will always have the clearest snapshot on what the true price is in the market, which is key. The biggest proponent of delay is something called propagation delay. Just means the further away you are from the signal, the longer it takes you to get it, so we said, why don't we introduce distance? 350 microseconds is 61 kilometres. We called up a fiber-optic provider, and we asked them to coil cable for us, and we had them fabricate this box. This is actually 38 miles of cable. It looks like three big fishing spools, so anyone who wants to trade on our exchange has to come in and traverse this distance. The high-frequency guys can be fast, and that's totally fine with them being fast, but because physics is physics, they'll never be 350 microseconds faster than us, so we can always ensure that we give our clients the fairest price. The filing to become a stock exchange for IEX was the most controversial filing of any stock exchange ever. All the negative comments were around 'you can't possibly introduce a speed bump into the market'. 'It's going to cause a calamity in the markets.' 'Everything's going to explode.' But in any case, we did get approved. I always found it funny, like in a market that has billions of dollars of technology invested into it, the most talked-about thing is IEX's exchange filing and a piece of equipment worth $27,000, but this $27,000 literally has billions and billions of dollars notionally trade through it every day, and trade at the fair price. So, it was worth the battle. We did get approval, and the SEC two years later put out a white paper saying not only did the calamity not occur in the market, the market overall, not just IEX, has been more stable since IEX became a stock exchange. Sure, you could do this by having a computer receive every signal, wait for however long you want, and then send it on. It would probably be cheaper. High-grade fiber-optic cable is expensive stuff, but that would be another system that could crash, or fail, or be defeated somehow. It's unnecessarily complicated. There's a lot to be said for a solution that just uses physics."
46,This Is Your Brain On Stale Air,"A quick warning: if you are good at empathising with other people, this week's guest video may make you feel short of breath. Seriously. With that out of the way, let me introduce you to Kurtis Baute, filming from inside his homemade, airtight biodome. Kurtis, good luck. [takes breath] Just over eight hours ago, I sealed myself inside of this cube. It is 10 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet, holds roughly 30,000 litres of air. I'm gonna try to make this as short and sweet as I can because with every breath that I take I am exhaling carbon dioxide, and it is toxic at high enough levels. Right now, it's at 6,370 parts per million. [takes breath] But to explain what that really means, I'm gonna have to step back a second. Okay, I built this airtight, plant-filled biodome for a series of videos on my channel about how we interact with the air we breathe. I have a bunch of safety equipment, including oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors and other gases and backups and blood monitors and a paramedic onsite. Do not try this at home. It is... Just don't try it at home. [laughing] I wanna step back 60 years ago to when carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere were around 300 parts per million. Modern day, because of industrialization and burning fossil fuels, those levels are now around 400 parts per million in natural landscapes. And in urban environments, it's more like 500 parts per million. But the thing is, we spend most of our time indoors, and that's often in poorly-ventilated spaces where the carbon dioxide levels can reach 1,000 parts per million. And what's important here is that researchers have gone out and tested the higher-order decision-making abilities of office employees at different levels of carbon dioxide, and they found that at 1,000 parts per million, there is a 15% decrease in cognitive function. [takes breath] That's a big deal because we spend a lot of our time in those sorts of environments. For example, researchers went to schools in Texas, Idaho, and Washington, and they found that in over 50% of those classrooms, the carbon dioxide levels went above 1,000 parts per million. In those same studies, they found that when levels reached 1,400, there was a 50% decrease in cognitive function. And by 2,000, there are all sorts of side effects, [laughing] which I am feeling a lot of, including nausea, loss of attention, uh... [laughing] I have to read, I have to read them. Some people report headaches, sleepiness, poor concentration, loss of attention, inincreased heart rate, and slight nausea. But still, these levels aren't uncommon. Carbon dioxide levels in bedrooms and cars frequently reach 4,000 parts per million, and those are places that we spend a lot of our time in. We used to use carbon dioxide as an indicator for when air was stale, but it's actually probably the most important part of what makes air stale. It's 6,500 parts per million in here right now and the air feels thick. It is clouding my brain. It is making me do way more takes in this video than I would've hoped. When we reach 10,000 parts per million, you're not supposed to work an eight-hour day in an environment like that because it's probably bad for your long-term health. You wouldn't want to be riding a motorcycle with that much carbon dioxide around you, but [takes breath] research shows that it's not uncommon for motorcycle helmets to have carbon dioxide levels that are that high. And I cannot imagine being impaired at this level and riding a motorcycle, let alone at 10,000 parts per million. Still, we have to go up quite a bit. We have to go all the way up to 30,000 before levels become extremely dangerous and potentially deadly. Now, I have some bad news and I have some good news. The bad news is that carbon dioxide levels are going to go up. They might even reach 695 parts per million by the end of the century. And that means that, globally, we could end up with something like a 10% or a 16% decrease in our cognitive function as a species, and that's a big deal. [takes breath] The good news is that we have the ability right now to change the environments that we live in, both in terms of the overall climate and in terms of the stale air spaces that we inhabit. [takes breath] So, you can go out and open a window in your office. I don't have that luxury, but you can. You can get some plants in your house. You can make sure that your HVAC, your air ventilation systems are up-to-date and functioning, [takes breath] and then you can use that cognitive surplus, you can use that bonus to your thinking abilities to try and find solutions for climate change and how you can make a difference. Tom, thank you so much for having me. I'm gonna lie down and stop talking. Thank you, Kurtis! Go subscribe to his channel. You can start with his series from inside his biodome or, if that is a bit much right now, I also recommend his one-take video on the entire history of the universe. Next week is the final guest video, and it's all about neuroscience."
47,How Knot To Hang A Painting,"This week's guest video was pitched to me as a puzzle and I couldn't solve it. So please welcome physicist Jade Tan-Holmes who's going to show you the same puzzle and then solve it with maths. Jade, take it away. Here's a puzzle for you. You have a painting, a piece of string, and two pins stuck in a wall. Can you hang the painting in such a way so that if you remove either one of the pins the painting falls? The thing to focus on here is how to tie the string around the pins, not any of the physics of the objects. So if you tie the string in the normal way one would hang a painting, this obviously won't work. It's pretty easy to think of ways we can tie the string so it falls when one of this pins is removed. But the challenge is to make it fall if either one is removed. Pause the video now if you'd like to try it for yourself. So what we're working towards is a way to tie the string around both pins as a whole but neither one individually. So there are a few different ways to solve this puzzle. But we're going to do the one which takes us through knot theory. Knot theory is the mathematical study of tangled systems. As this is a problem about tangling things together, chances are knot theory will come in handy. With puzzles like these it's sometimes hard to know where to even begin. A common technique mathematicians use is to strip away everything but the most important features. So, let's think about what we can get rid of. What parts of the problem aren't providing us with any useful information? Let's look at the painting. It's cool, but is it really telling us anything? It's just joining the two ends of the string. If we get rid of it and tie the string together we can reframe the question as can we hang the string so that if either one of the pins is removed, the string will fall? It's just a simpler version of the same question. Sorry, fashionable chicken. [chicken squawks] What else is unnecessary info? Let's take a look at these pins. Basically nothing matters about them except how they interact with the string and the fact that they don't interact with each other. We don't care about their positions, size, shape or colour. We don't even care that they're pins. Mathematically, it makes sense to want to deal with just one type of object instead of two. Imagine reading a story that's written in both English and Chinese. Sure, both languages make up the whole story but it'd be much easier to work with if it was all the same language. This is exactly what we're going to do now. Translate our problem all into the same language, the language of knot theory, by converting our pins into strings. All the properties we care about are still there. If we tie them shut they can't interact with each other and they can trap our original string. In knot theory a closed string is called a knot and a group of entangled knots is called a link. Now we can reframe the question again as can you tie the three knots so that when together they're interlocked, but if you remove one, the others fall apart? So far we've gotten rid of a bunch of information, but we haven't really isolated what's important. What should be focus on if we want to solve the puzzle? Well, there's really only one way a string can interact with another. It can cross over them or it can cross under. The crossings are the only things we have control over and are the key to unlocking the puzzle. The crossings basically determine one knot from another. But the thing is, the same crossing can look very different. This makes knots hard to reason about in an organised way. It's like if you had all the components of a story but had no idea what order they were meant to be in. But if we organise the crossings we can reason much more clearly about the knot. Let's take this random link of two knots. If I start on a random string, at a random point and start following the string, drawing on my paper as I go, we can keep track of all the crossings in an organised way. We keep going until we come back to where we started. We've just created something called a braid diagram. Knot theorists use these to model all kinds of links. The point of braid diagrams is to keep track of the crossings while getting rid of all the unnecessary information distracting us. In a braid diagram, the lines representing our strings are called strands. If we label the strand positions one, two, and three, when the strand in position one crosses over the strand in position two we can label this crossing X, and when the strand is position one crosses under the strand in position two, we'll call this inverse X, as it basically undoes what X just did. When the strand in position two crosses over the strand in position three we'll call this Y. And when the strand in position two crosses under the strand in position three, we'll call this inverse Y. This notation is called a braid group. And actually everything we need to know about our problem is encoded in these letters. The way these letters work is that the X and inverse X cancel and the Y and inverse Y cancel. But they only cancel out if they are next to each other. So coming back to our problem we want the knots to be interlocked as a whole but none of them locked individually to another. So if we think about this in terms of our braid group, removing a knot is like removing all crossings involving that knot. If we remove the green string all the Xs will be removed. And if we remove the pink string all the Ys will be removed. What we want is a configuration where as a whole nothing cancels. But if we remove either term, everything cancels. Let's see what we can do. We've got three strings. Our system is symmetric, so what we do first really doesn't matter. Let's just start with an X. Remember the pins can't interact with each other, so we have no choice but to do another X or inverse X. We don't want to have an X and an inverse X next to each other because we don't want anything to cancel yet. So we'll do another X crossing. This is just like wrapping one string around the other. We could keep going like this with the Xs but we need to include the other string, so let's do some Ys. Now because we want our terms to cancel out in the end, that means every X needs an inverse X and every Y needs an inverse Y. If we do two inverse Y crossings now they'll immediately cancel out the Ys we just did, which isn't what we want. So let's try two inverse Xs. Now we can do two inverse Ys. So let's take a look at where we're at. If you remove all the Y terms, the remaining X terms cancel each other out. And if you remove all the X terms, the remaining Y terms cancel each other out. But when everything is together, nothing cancels. That's exactly what we want. Now let's work backwards to the original puzzle, chicken and all. We can use the braid diagram to model our link. Let's see if it has the property we want. That when all three of them are together they're locked, but if you remove one the others fall apart. Yup! Now let's bring back the chicken and the pins. Okay guys, this is it. So now we're going to map our braid group notation onto our system of pins. So, remember from the braid group diagram that basically a double X corresponded to wrapping one string around the other. And a double inverse X corresponded to undoing that move. So here we're going to say that a double X corresponds to wrapping around a pin clockwise and a double inverse X corresponds to undoing that move which would just be wrapping around the pin counterclockwise. So, double X. Double inverse X. Double Y. Double inverse Y. So let's do it. Double X Double Y. Double inverse X, wrapping around counterclockwise. Double inverse Y. So now the moment of truth. [drumroll] [thudding] BOTH: Mathematics! So this definitely wasn't the easiest or most straightforward way to solve this puzzle. So, why did we do it this way? Well, now we have this whole framework for solving this problem for any number of pins easily. If we want to add another pin to the puzzle this would be a nightmare to brute force. But we can just work backwards from our braid group, and it's simple. Today we used knot theory to solve a fun puzzle, but it actually leads to some very fundamental mathematics. We were searching for a way to wrap the string around both pins as a whole, but neither one individually. But more broadly we had to keep track of the relationships between smaller parts of a bigger system. This kind of connection has led to deep insights in many areas of science. Just recently, people have been exploring the design of quantum computers using particles that behave just like the braids that we saw in this video. So if you want to win a Nobel prize someday better start tying some knots! Thank you Jade!  Go subscribe to Up and Atom. I would recommend starting with her video on quantum tunnelling. And next week, a video that may leave you breathless."
48,The Fishermen That Hold Their Breath For 10 Minutes,"I'm taking January off, and while I'm gone, some amazing creators are going to be taking over this channel. We start with Rohin Francis, a cardiologist who runs Medlife Crisis. His video includes footage from his diving trip to Borneo and a couple of jokes that I am deeply uncomfortable with. Rohin, over to you. How long can you hold your breath? One, two minutes? I'm sorry, homo sapiens are just pretty pathetic next to the diving world champions who can stay underwater for one or two hours. So how do they do it? Well, there are a few different ways, some you can actually take advantage of by channelling your inner dolphin. [dolphin squeak] Others involve a little bit of gentle evolution, so maybe a bit of a tall order for most of us unless you're a member of an Asian community who have evolved into real life Aquamen. [tranquil music] There are five ways we can spend longer underwater. Number one is to increase your tolerance to carbon dioxide. The first thing that makes you want to take a breath is the rising level of carbon dioxide or hypercapnia. ""Hyper from the Greek, meaning too much or above, ""and kapnos, meaning smoke."" This acidic waste gas builds up, and the body is so acutely sensitive to any changes in pH, even though it's tiny, that it starts screaming at you to... Breathe, god damn you! Incidentally, this is why any diet claiming to alkalinize your blood is basically [cow moo] Now you can improve your carbon dioxide tolerance quite quickly. I was able to go from about 90 seconds breath-hold to five minutes with just a few days' worth of snorkelling and some tips from an experienced free diver. The next obstacle though is a lot harder to get around and that's hypoxia or low oxygen. Hypoxia kills cells. No matter how you die, ultimately it's hypoxia at the cellular level, i.e. your cells being starved of oxygen, that is the cause of your inevitable death. Unlike training your body to become more tolerant to hypercapnia, increasing your tolerance to hypoxia takes years of training. And of course, there is a level past which no human can actually go. So what is the solution for a longer dive? Well, to maximise oxygen delivery and minimise oxygen use. Which brings me to number two. The reason that this steak is red is a protein called myoglobin, which is found in the muscles of pretty much every mammal and it's responsible for storing oxygen. However if we were tucking into a steak that came from a seal it would be almost black in appearance because they've got ten times more myoglobin than humans or cows. This is not a human steak. So why can't we just pack in more myoglobin and store more oxygen like the seals do? The problem with proteins is that [child burbles] The problem with proteins is that when they g-[child burbles] The problem with proteins is th-[child drums] The problem with proteins is when they get too tightly packed they start to clump together and lose their function but marine mammals have evolved a very clever way to deal with this. Their variant of the myoglobin molecule has a positive electric charge. As I'm sure you know, positive repels positive and as a result the proteins can get very close together without forming those clumps. Number three is to adjust your blood flow to preferentially supply the heart and the brain at the expense of things like the extremities which are much more tolerant to having a reduced blood flow. And number four is to slow your heart down. Your heart is very oxygen-hungry organ so by reducing your heart rate you're immediately buying yourself more time under water. I've mentioned these two together because they form part of the dive reflex. Erroneously sometimes called the mammalian dive reflex. It's actually been found in pretty much every air-breathing vertebrate that's been studied. It's stimulated by submersion in water, particularly cold water. And remember, below 200m depth, water is cold no matter where you are in the world and of course that's where most mammals do their hunting. So what is the dive reflex? Well let's take a look. [bells] [blows conch shell] That's the wrong video. I've not tried this before but I filled up a basin with ice water. I'm going to hold my breath and submerge my face in the water probably just for about thirty seconds or so and I'll see if anything happens to my heart rate. I've got a pulse oximeter that you can see. Okay. Here goes. Agh. That was cold. So my heart rate has dropped right down to 45. It's still staying at 45. I don't know how long I was under maybe 30, 40 seconds. Now you can see it's slowly starting to climb again. This is just a cheap Â£10 oximeter that I bought online so I don't know how low the heart rate goes. I don't know when it starts becoming inaccurate but a lot of these commercial devices will have a cut off in the forties because most people's heart rate doesn't go that low. But I think it was a pretty clear demonstration. In diving mammals this is far more pronounced with Weddell's seals, for example, dropping the heart rate as low as four beats a minute. This effect is mediated by my favourite nerve, the vagus. Don't tell me you don't have a favourite nerve. Number five is also part of the dive reflex because it has another feature and that's to squeeze your spleen. The spleen is normally a small organ which is involved with the immune system and filtering the blood as such stores a little reservoir of blood. Now, in a healthy human with a normal sized spleen, that volume will be around 160ml of blood or 5% extra oxygen carrying ability, which can be squeezed out as part of the dive reflex when needed. However, diving mammals can have significantly enlarged spleens representing a much bigger reservoir of blood to be provided when necessary. I'm sorry, it looks like this one's out of reach for most of us. But that doesn't mean that there aren't any members of our species that haven't taken advantage. However, to meet them, we're going to need to take a short trip to Southeast Asia. Years ago I saw a BBC documentary that stuck in my mind permanently, which was about a fisherman who was so negatively buoyant he essentially sank twenty metres and walked along the bottom of the seabed, and what's more, he almost effortlessly held his breath for several minutes. He was member of the Bajau community, who are an ethnic group indigenous to oceanic Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia and here. I'm in north Borneo at the moment, in Sabah where they're one of the biggest ethnic groups and my diving instructors here tell legendary stories of Bajau who can hold their breath for fifteen minutes at a time under water. So what makes them so special? The Bajau have led a nomadic subsistence lifestyle for at least a thousand years, literally living out at sea, eating what they catch and rarely setting foot on land. Earlier this year, a research team led out of Copenhagen published an incredible study which demonstrated that the Bajau have evolved larger than average spleens when compared to nearby non-diving communities. Free divers develop big spleens through training. But the enlarged spleens in the Bajau are seen in members of the community who don't do any fishing or diving so we know that this is a genetic adaptation. You might wonder how a genetic pressure has been exerted until you consider the fact that the Bajau who dive spend five hours under water per day. So you can easily imagine how any mutation to confer an increased diving ability would have been positively selected. They identified many genetic variations seen in the Bajau but two snappily titled genes stood out. PDE10A is a gene noted to have differences amongst the Bajau, specifically the part of the gene that is responsible for thyroid function and spleen size. And the BDKRB2 gene is involved in the blood redistribution part of the dive reflex that we talked about earlier. Rather like the Sherpa in the high altitude Himalaya, this is evidence of human evolution from our fairly recent past. And now we're in the era of genetic analysis becoming commonplace, we're able to trace specific mutations and how they've travelled through time and geographically to make us the people we are today. But does research like this actually benefit patients here in hospital? Well I see the effects of hypoxia secondary to disease on a daily basis, where it causes death and disability. The hope is that by understanding how the Bajau or the Sherpa have adapted to life in a low oxygen environment, might guide development of new treatments to help the critically ill. Honey I've, uh, thought of a name. Just hear me out here. What do you think of Tom Scott Francis? Ow! [clears throat] Thanks, Rohin. Go subscribe to Medlife Crisis! I would recommend starting with his Minute Medicine video on why you shouldn't run every medical test even if you can. Next week, a maths puzzle for you."
49,"Why NASA Spun Astronauts Around, But Doesn't Any More","I'm at Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama, and this is the Multi-Axis Trainer, or MAT. Otherwise known as that spinny thing that astronauts get strapped into. This is an icon of space exploration and space training. And it looks really fun, or really terrifying, depending on how close you are to it. But what does it actually do? You ready? No! Eyes open. Whoa. When you come to Space Camp, you typically ride the MAT for no longer than 45 seconds. The MAT spins on three different axes and three different rings. The outer ring is locked. The centre ring is powered by a motor, and then the inner ring is free spinning. And then inside that is a chair that is also spinning on a different axis. While you're riding the MAT, you don't spin in more than one direction twice in a row, so you don't get dizzy or nauseous, but you do get disoriented. It's a very important difference that they feel. As your stomach stays in the centre of rotation, you're gonna get a lot of blood and momentum feeling in your head and your feet. Most people love the feeling of the Multi-Axis Trainer. They love the feeling of being disoriented without being dizzy, which is a really rare experience for most roller coasters or simulators like this. It's based off of something called the MASTIF, which was used during the Mercury programme. The MASTIF was actually a series of cages around a central chair. The MAT is a series of rings. During the 1960s, astronauts in the Mercury and Gemini programs would need to train on something like the MASTIF because of the shape of their vehicle. It's a capsule and it would spin very erratically if something were going wrong. Unlike the Shuttle astronauts where they were in something more plane-shaped, and so when something is going wrong in a plane it doesn't act the same. So the Mercury astronauts weren't just strapped into this thing's big brother to disorient them. It was training, if something -oh! -like this is happening in space, then your mission has gone disastrously wrong. In training, they would be spun up to anything up to 30 revolutions a minute, much faster than this, with much higher G forces. And then the trainer would hand the controls over to them. The astronaut's chair would [groans] have controls on it connected to nitrogen gas thrusters. They would have to work out which way they were spinning in three dimensions, in real time. [groans] And then they would have to figure out how to make it stop. For me, it's a little bit easier. Could we uh, could we make this stop, please? The MAT was never used to actually train astronauts. We only use it as a simulator here at Space Camp. I've actually ridden the MAT as well. We had to do it for training. I like to say that most people don't get dizzy, because there are some people who do. I'm one of them! I completely forgot to do the outro. Could we go again, please? If you're good. [groans] Oh, there we go. Thank you very much to all the team at Space Camp. You can find out more about them at the links on screen or in the description. [laughs] Yeah, I'm done. I am very much done."
50,The other tree that owns itself,"You may already have heard of the Tree That Owns Itself. It's had a Wikipedia article since 2006. There are lots of news articles about it, and a Tumblr post that has, as I record this, more than 800,000 notes. Not views, notes. And there are already a lot of YouTube videos about this. Someone visits this tree in Athens, Georgia, and tells the story of how a local landowner with fond childhood memories wrote a legal document bestowing the tree's ownership onto itself sometime in the early 19th century. And then, they'll go into a discourse about how, under the actual law, there's no legal basis for that so the ownership is unclear. And then they'll talk about how everyone just agrees to behave like it is the law, even though this oak tree isn't even actually the same tree? The original one fell in the 1940s and was replaced. And finally, they'll talk about how all law is ultimately based on the social contract that each of us follows. What they don't talk about is the other tree that owns itself, which is about 200 miles that way. In the city of Eufaula, just over the border into Alabama, there is another oak tree with a nearly-identical story. It was a city landmark. The local council bestowed the tree's ownership onto itself, and everyone just rolled with it. And when the tree eventually fell in a storm, a new one was put here, and everyone just agreed that it counted as the same tree. But this tree does not have a Wikipedia article. It isn't even referenced on the other tree's article, at least not as I record this. There aren't dozens of YouTube videos about it. Information about this tree has been buried under all the search results and news articles dedicated to the tree over in Georgia. For some reason, that one has better publicity. Maybe it's because that one was first, by about a century, but given that both of them were deeded decades before the internet, I'm not sure that's too much of an advantage. More likely, it's the same reason that many different ideas take off while others don't: it's all about who you know. The tree in Georgia is in a big college town, home to the University of Georgia, and home to students who will arrive from out of town, learn the story, and then leave. Eufaula, here? While it's a really pretty city, it has a fraction of the population and no big reason for out-of-towners to visit. Stories don't tend to spread as well from places like this. Heck, maybe there are other trees out there in other small towns where the same thing's happened, but I couldn't find any references to them under all the noise made by the one that everyone noticed. If you want a metaphor for how success on the internet and, heck, anywhere works, then these trees are it: it's not always about how good your story is. It's about how many people are willing and able to pass it on."
51,Britain's largest battery is actually a lake,"We learn about conservation of energy in school. How you can take potential energy, like the energy in the chemicals in this battery, and you can then just convert it to electrical energy. And then convert that to whatever you can find a use for. A battery is just a store of potential energy. And that potential energy could be chemical, or it could be gravitational. This lake in this rainy bit of Wales is part of the largest battery in Britain. And it's rechargeable. Welcome to Dinorwig Power Station, otherwise known as Electric Mountain. What we have is a large reservoir at the top of the mountain, a large reservoir at the bottom, and between the two, a power station, which converts that potential energy into electricity. The power station itself is located inside that mountain in deep caverns. We release that potential energy through the station. It drives a turbine that spins round at synchronous speeds, connected to the grid. It drives a generator, converting that into electricity. We then export that onto the National Grid. And then at nighttime, we just reverse the whole process. The turbine turns into a pump. The generator becomes a motor. And we push that water back up the hill into the reservoir at Marchlyn Mawr, at the top of the mountain. The operating principle here is that the generation that the station is able to do during the daytime helps the nation meet those peaks of electricity demand. And overnight, it's able to pump the water back when prices are lower. In electrical terms, we have around nine gigawatt-hours of storage at the top of the mountain. And in fact over the course of a day, the water passing through the station is broadly equivalent to the total household consumption of water in the UK. At full load, we can be meeting the demand of around about two million homes. This sounds like a really simple idea, but when there's this much energy involved, the design challenges are ridiculous. If you've ever lived in a house where you turn off a water tap and the the pipes go clunk, then you know about water hammer. Water isn't compressible, so closing a tap means that all the water that is under pressure and rushing down the pipe suddenly has nowhere to go. So if the pipes in your house aren't secured properly, the crash and rebound of all that water can make the plumbing move and make noise. If that can happen with just a tap in a house, imagine what could happen when one of the valves here closes. At full capacity, there is somewhere around a swimming pool every second rushing through the turbines down there. When that valve closes, all that water heading down here suddenly has nowhere to go. The pressure would do enormous amounts of damage. It would break everything apart, if it wasn't for one extra bit of plumbing. A shaft hundreds of metres deep that acts as a pressure release. We can't see anything, on the surface or from down here, sadly, it all happens deep within the mountain. But every time those valves move, [valve clanking] that surge pipe is what stops the whole system from tearing itself apart. This station is not some quirky old curiosity. This is serious engineering that keeps the lights on around the country. Dinorwig Power Station is one of the largest power stations of its type in the world, and it's also one of the fastest-acting power stations. So as well as being able to take advantage of the peaks and troughs in the electricity market, it was essentially built, primarily, with the intent to provide very fast response onto the system in order to help the National Grid balance supply and demand instantaneously on a second-by-second basis. So it has the capacity to be able to go from zero up to its full capacity, maybe 2,000 megawatts, within 10 to 30 seconds. When people talk about pumped storage, they tend to associate it a lot with TV pickups, and National Grid, in analysing that risk, study the TV schedules and plan ahead and put Dinorwig on standby, if you like, to be able to meet those pickups. Going back to the 80s and the 90s, everyone would be sitting around the same TV channels with a limited choice, then. All the ingredients you need for a sort-of collective putting-on of the kettle and opening of the fridge. Pickups could be pretty significant. But since then, people are streaming on YouTube, on Netflix, all the different plethora of channels that we have, so that has changed that sort of coincidence of viewing on one channel. The current environment that we're in, we have significant amount of renewable technology on the system, which provides a level of unpredictability day to day. And actually, the importance of storage now is that we can use it to help develop the amount of renewables we have and allow us to fill in those gaps when the wind's not blowing and the sun is not shining. So having storage is such an important component of the modern grid system. Thank you very much to all the team at Engie who made this visit possible. Pull down the description for more about them, and more about Electric Mountain. A battery is just... a store!... of potential energy."
52,Why do London's manholes keep exploding?,"I want to be really clear: the odds of a manhole in a London street suddenly exploding while you're next to it are tiny. This is not something to worry about. And the company that handles the cables under London's streets is spending a lot of money fixing them up. But, yeah, about once or twice a month on average, somewhere in London, a bit of pavement just goes... boomf. But no-one wants to license security camera footage of actual pavement explosions to just someone on YouTube, and no-one wants to be interviewed about it either. So instead, we are going to create our own underground explosion right here with the help of a friendly pyrotechnician. And the easy answer to why London's pavements keep exploding... well, it would be ""electrical faults"", and that's what the news often blames. As seasons change, the ground is going to get warmer and cooler, it's going to expand and contract, rain and subsidence will move the soil, and over the course of decades that is going to steadily wear out the 36,000km of electrical cables and 100,000 electrical junction boxes that are under London. Most of those were laid decades ago. It's a big city. Things will break. But an electrical fault won't make an explosion. If electricity goes somewhere it shouldn't, then the circuit breakers that control the grid will detect that and shut it off right away. The trouble is that there's a lot of other old stuff under London's streets. Including gas pipes. A steady, slow gas leak in a pipe might not be detected for a while, and in that time the gas can spread a long distance through narrow underground tunnels. So if you've got gas in a tight underground space where it can't expand, thank you, and an electrical spark to set it off... well, that's all we're doing here: under that cover there is a fuel source, not enough room for it to expand, and something to make an electrical spark. That's all you need for an explosion. Fire in the hole. ""This looks devastating in slow motion. ""The burst of flame, the flying manhole cover, ""at 1800 frames per second on a zoom lens it looks like it could do serious damage. ""But even this dramatised explosion, made with the help of a pyrotechnician, ""this worst-case-scenario... is actually not that bad. ""I tried to do the 'cool guys don't look at explosions' shot, ""and when you take away all this style..."" Fire in the hole. ""It'd hurt if you were standing on it, sure, ""but like I said, it's not something to be worried about."""
53,ááááááááááá and áááááá,"This is an Ogham stone, or ""ogg-em"" stone, depending on whose pronunciation you follow. The carvings on here are from an alphabet unlike anything else in the world, an alphabet that is literally an exception to modern rules. Iâm not talking about the Roman letters on the face: Iâm talking about the markings carved into the corner. Those markings are in Ogham -itâs a way of writing down the early Irish language with marks like these. There are only about 400 surviving stones like this, found in Ireland and the western parts of the UK. This particular one is about 1500 years old, and it comes from Devon in the south west of England. Itâs on display here at the British Museum. The inscription is a name. Ogham stones are mostly used to record names, either as a tombstone or as a marker of land ownership. You read this along the stemline, along the corner. Each character is made of one to five markings, which will all be on one side of the line, the other side of the line, through the line, or on the line. When modern scholars started to analyse this script, they wanted to write it down on paper, and they adapted it a little to make it easier for them: they changed it so it always went left to right, and each phrase was drawn on a horizontal line so you could easily tell which marks were on which side. Some Ogham inscriptions, on later stones or on other artefacts, do actually carve their own stemline into a flat surface, so adding that line in print wasn't too much of a stretch. And after all, trying to fold a bit of paper and sketch markings on the corner wouldn't be easy to work with for academic papers. And that left us, years later, with an interesting technology problem. When it came time to encode Ogham characters as 1s and 0s, to fold them into Unicode, the international standard for how to display text on a computer: Ogham became the only language in Unicode where a space is not a space. A space character, to a computer, has three properties: it has a certain width, you don't display or print anything in that width, and if your text has run out of room on a line, you can go back to the previous space character and replace it with a line break. Now, there have been well-understood variations on those for years. Two of those rules are flouted all the time. You can have a non-breaking space, like the one between a word and a French quotation mark. That space has width, it has nothing displayed in it, but you can't put a line break there. The word and punctuation must travel together. You can also have a zero-width space, which sounds like a ridiculous idea, but it's a good way to tell a computer that, if there isn't room, it's OK to break a long string of characters somewhere that it otherwise wouldn't. These are all commonly used. But until Ogham was added to Unicode, the rule that a space character must be empty had never been broken. Why would it? It's a space. Well, an Ogham space includes that stemline. The line doesnât stop between words, because the corner doesnât stop between words. The space is not a space... but it behaves like one. It can be replaced with a line break. If you spread an Ogham inscription over two lines, the space character vanishes, same as in English. Now, Ogham isn't the only language that uses a separator like this. Ancient Latin used an interpunct, a middle dot, the same way. But in modern usage that is not a space, and modern usage wins. Ogham is the only case where modern folks have gone, yeah, okay, it's a space that also involves drawing something. It's a space that isn't a space. There's been an actual argument about it, down in one of the mailing lists for linguists and computer science nerds at the Unicode Consortium. The Irish contingent had some very strong opinions. And the final ruling: yep. It's a space that's also a line. This is one of the things I love about linguistics: an ancient script, carved into stones more than a millennium ago, is an exception to a rule that I never even realised was there. A space doesnât have to be a space."
54,Wingwalking used to be a lot more dangerous,"Oh boy. Back in the dawn of aviation, in the 1920s, wing-walking was an incredibly dangerous stunt. Daredevils would get out of the seat in their plane and just clamber around the wings with nothing but their own strength. Maybe there'd be a pole at the top they could attach to once they were up there, but mostly it was just them and their strength against 100mph wind. Now there are still a very small number of folks in the world who do wing-walking that way, but in the 21st century, wing-walking is a little bit different. Hahaha! Oh, yes! Oh, wow. We go at roughly from 80 to 160mph. Various, in between that. And we'll pull up to 4g, so it's a huge strain on our bodies and we're doing manoeuvres, so we'll lift our legs up, we can do handstands and we'll also move around. It's like resistance training, it's really hard work. In the loop, we'll get to about 4g at the bottom and then as soon as we go over the top we start waving, cause that's the nice weightless bit, so it's easier to start then, than start when you're going really quickly. You have about a month of intense training. You practise everything on the ground first and then you just go up in the air and do it repetitively. You fly everyday, all day, so it's absolutely knackering. At Eastbourne Airshow, we take off from an airfield near Brighton and we fly along the coast for 20 minutes and then they climb up onto the wing, so they climb up in flight. On the transit flight, the procedure for them to climb onto the wing is for them to unstrap their main seat harness, but at all times they have a carabiner which slides up and down the wire. Their cable is about 60cm long, so they can never be more than 60cm away from the centre line of the aircraft. Once they get up onto the wing, the carabiner is then behind them, still attached, and then they strap themselves into the five point harness, which is on the swivel rig on the wing and at that point, of course, then they have two methods of attachment. That's totally different to the 1920s!                       Woo-hoo!           Woo-hoo-hoo! The main difference when having someone on the wing is that there is a significant amount of drag from that person. It's a bit like flying an aircraft with your gear and flaps down. You'll need more power to fly and you need to check the trim as well, because the people on the wing provide a forward centre of gravity. So at the end of the show, we'll chat to everyone and they'll tell us what they enjoyed. Usually, it's when we do the rolls and we go upside down because they can't quite believe that we're strapped on. From the air, you can't see our wire. It's all a bit of an illusion, so it looks like we're not attached, and they're like, ""Oh my gosh!"" So it's a bit of a daredevil thing they think is going on as well. Kids come up to us all the time, especially young girls that are doing gymnastics and think, 'oh my gosh, that's incredible', so it's really nice to feel like you're a bit of a role model for people. That is exhausting. That is one of the most physically strenuous things I think I've ever done. Whoo! Hahaha!"
55,Your private messages travel under this beach,"This remote beach in the far south-west of England was a major target during the Second World War. It was so tactically important that the government's Petroleum Warfare Department installed flame throwers all the way across it to try and repel anyone who might try to come ashore and sabotage what's underneath. Welcome to Porthcurno in Cornwall. Under here was how Britain talked to the world, and to a lesser extent, how it still does. Under the Porthcurno Beach ran the original telegraph cables linking Britain with her Empire. What you're looking at is the cable hut which was the original landing point for the cables which ran from Porthcurno all around the world. There were 14 cables. The length of the cables amassed about 186,000 miles. The cables were dragged up the beach, terminated into old valve terminations in the cable hut and then the message was relayed underground up to the cable station, which is the building that now houses the museum. These cables were fearsomely expensive to make and to lay and the last thing you needed is some idiot dropping an anchor on them or snagging them in their nets. The beach has got very deep sand and it shifts all the time, so it's never been used for fishing, so you don't have boats landing here regularly, or you didn't in 1870, so it was a perfect place. We also have World War II tunnels. Back in 1939, when war was declared, we had Britain's premier communications hub in a very prominent white building, standing out on top of a cliff in a sparsely populated area, which wasn't the smartest idea. So, 15,000 tonnes of granite was blasted out from the cliff and the whole thing was moved underground. A lot of folks think that when they're sending a message to someone in another country, it's getting bounced up to a satellite and back down. But, unless you're in a really rural area, that is not the case. Most comm satellites in geostationary orbit, which means that they are falling around the earth at the exact same rate that the earth is spinning below them. But to make that orbit work, they have to be so far away that it takes half a second for a signal to get beamed up to them and back down. The route around the surface of the earth is much shorter and much faster and it doesn't involve blasting something into orbit. Undersea cables do have their own troubles, though. November 2016, Jersey pretty much lost all its internet communication because a boat dragged its anchor across the seabed, took out three high capacity cables, leaving just one, and Jersey was... not cut off, but hugely reduced communications whilst they set about repairing them. When they laid the first cable out to the Isles of Scilly from Porthcurno, it was all well reported in the media about how they were going to get connectivity. What wasn't reported was that they'd actually made the cable too short. So what they did was they got an end of cable, connected this dead end-of-cable up to the landing station and went, ""Hoorah, it works!"" when it wasn't working at all and then the media took all the photos, they went away, and then they put the problem right. So, don't always believe what you see on film. Or YouTube! There are still active telecom cables under Porthcurno beach, although they're fibre-optic these days, and they don't surface at the Telegraph Museum's old cable hut here. They surface at industrial-looking buildings somewhere further ashore. One of those cables, called FLAG, goes all the way from under this beach here to Japan, 15,000 miles of cable stopping at a dozen other countries along the way and it can carry up to 100 gigabytes of data every second. And it's just one of many that land somewhere in this part of Britain. The fact that there's also several buildings owned by the British Intelligence Services around here is not a coincidence. So the next time you're in a group chat with people all over the world or video calling someone on another continent, just take a moment and remember that somewhere near you there is a beach with your conversation literally flashing underneath it."
56,How the 90s VHS look works,"The VHS look has been popular lately in music videos and other video art, as the 90s come back into fashion: all neon colours and diagonal lines and over-enthusiastic voices! I cannot keep that up. Now, some producers will actually take the time to get their nice, crisp HD footage and put it through an actual video recorder to get that effect, but let's be honest, most won't. Most will use the same filter as everyone else, so I figured to explain how it works I would talk to the guy who wrote that filter. VHS has very muted colour because more information is dedicated to the black-and-white information or the luminance part of the image. The colour suffers a little bit, so it gets downsampled, there's less information there, it tends to kinda get softened and bleed outside of the edges and stuff. When we originally gathered footage, so, they went out to Goodwill and second-hand stores and picked up as many VHS and SVHS decks that they could find. With the decks and camcorders that we had, we used a clean reference image that we could later compare the recorded version on the deck to. So, when you take an original, clean version and the post-VHS version and line them on top of each other, you can create what we call a lookup table, which allows us to define the colour differences between the two images. But a lot of the time, people are quite young, applying these retro filters or styles, and have sort of an idea of what they're supposed to look like, so it's a little bit of both. VHS is an analog format, it's not storing ones and zeros, it's storing patterns on a magnetic tape, and that means that copies aren't bit-perfect. Not only is there random noise, but there's also some interesting analog glitches. We start with a blank tape, it looks like this. When you throw it in to one of the VCR decks, one of them has the lid off of it, and that is the one that actually died making the VHS transitions. That one went through a lot and all of that got printed onto this tape. Essentially just taking the device and then doing a lot of bad things to it. While the tape is loaded in through the playback heads, you can run a magnet across them and just really mess up how it's going to play that back, and tracking be damned: it'll flutter and be all over the place. This one, I believe, died based on a belt failure, but that belt failed while I was using two pencil erasers that were taped to my fingers slowing down the head while dropping a magnet on top of it. It was interesting, and then all of a sudden it just mechanically stopped. The hardest part about that was just getting the tape out. There is a section in the code that is just called 'tape damage'. There are things like what we call the pop lines, when you are recording tape and you get pieces of dust or debris or whatever stuck to the tape and it rolls across the scan head, that one line will create a streak across the screen, and then there's also a scrolling wrinkle. Generally it's repeating cause often that happens when the tape jams up or something like that, and you end up with a bunch of wrinkles that somebody then reassembled the tape back. Of course, there are some things that a filter can't add, like: Camera angles! Neon typography! And fake enthusiasm! But perhaps some things are better left in the past.

57,We Should Let Some Wildfires Burn,"Down below me are the forests of British Columbia, BC for short. They're home to people a few, anyway wildlife, and basically every alien planet that Stargate SG-1 ever went to. Now I don't want to be too simplistic here, but forests are made of wood. And wood is flammable. Very flammable. Just over that ridge is the site of the Elaho wildfire, which in 2015 burned an area the size of Manhattan over 10 weeks. And that was just a small one. In 2017, 19 wildfires combined together to burn an area 130km end-to-end. Since about 2003, we have been having continuously record-breaking temperatures, record-breaking droughts, and record-breaking fire seasons. The fires that we have observed in the last decade are large, aggressive fires that are very difficult to control. Often, when we see fires, we look at them and think they're destructive, but in truth, many fires do more good than harm. We see, in our northern forests, trees are actually adapted to release their seeds and to grow back after a major fire, which burns from tree top to tree top and kills those trees, creating large openings. In our drier ecosystems, they're kind of a lower intensity surface fire that cleanses the forest, takes away the dead grasses, the branches that have accumulated down on the ground, but leaves the big trees that are resistant to that fire and create a very healthy ecosystem that is dependent on fire. Now, I grew up in England, where there's not much woodland left and what there is is carefully managed and controlled. So to me, the idea that fire could be a good thing is counterintuitive. And don't get me wrong, playing with matches in a forest is still a very bad idea. But it turns out that having a professional set a precise fire at a precise time and place could actually be a good idea. In absence of fires, the fuels have built up in the forests and now, when we have fires, they're even more intense than they were in the past. Historically, we know that fires, in parts of the province, especially in the dry forests of British Columbia, were really frequent. So these are fires that would burn through the understory of the forest and in those forests, we have thick-barked trees that are adapted to fire. So they resist the fire and they survive. Each of these marks down at the bottom that you can see is a fire scar embedded in the tree rings and it is showing the history of fire in this particular environment. There are enough fire scars embedded in the tree rings that it burned 42 times over its lifetime. Up until 2010, our policy in BC was 100% fire suppression. So we would try to detect and suppress fires as quickly as possible. As of 2012, we changed to allow managed wildfires on the landscape, allowing some fires in remote areas where it doesn't put human lives or values at risk. Those managed fires are trying to get the ecosystem to function as it did historically. So if we go into those areas that have dense forests right up to our backyards and if we assess those forests and remove some of the trees, in particular, the small trees in the understory, and then come in and use a prescribed burn to clean up all the small fuels on the ground and stimulate all those fire-adapted plants in the understory, we can not only reduce the risk of fire damaging our communities, but we can restore our ecosystems and improve ecosystem health. My pilot today has been Bradley Friesen, along with-Mr. Bentley, the dog. Co-pilot back there. And you're starting a channel soon called? Destruction by Gravity. That's gonna be a fun one. There's not much there yet, but check it out. I think there's gonna be some fun stuff. Thank you to you, thank you also to Dr. Lori Daniels at UBC. A lot of fun, I liked it."
58,The sourtoe cocktail has a human toe in it,"This video contains images of a preserved, severed human toe. Just warning you. There's not really much I can say here. I'm in Dawson City, which is an old mining town in the Yukon Territory, where the Klondike and Yukon rivers meet, and this... this is a cocktail with a severed human toe in it. The Sourtoe Cocktail, it's real simple: straight shot of liquor, at least 40%, and you drop a human toe into it. It all started way back in Prohibition era. Two brothers running alcohol up into Alaska. They thought the police were on their trail, so one of the brothers stepped through some water, got frostbite on his toe. The other brother took an axe, hacked off the toe. They left it in a jar of their alcohol out in a cabin in the woods. Years later, Captain Dick Stevenson bought this cabin, was emptying it out and he found this jar with a toe in it, thought it'd be hilarious to bring it to the bar, and do some drinks with it with his friends, and the Sourtoe Cocktail was born. Our toes we receive from donors, mostly anonymous, but we actually have a gentleman over in the UK right now who ran the Yukon ultra-marathon over the winter, got frostbite, and decided, you know what? Might as well put these frostbitten, removed toes to good use, so we're having somebody pick them up in June, and hopefully, he can come back here someday and do his own toes in a Sourtoe Cocktail. Terry Lee is our current Sourtoe Master. Former ferryboat captain, so he's got his title of captain there. Fun guy, loves his toes. I serve four nights a week. I've been doing this for five years, and I've seen all kinds of people. This toe is a hammertoe, which was deformed, and so it had to be removed. Who it was removed from, I don't know. The person is probably still alive, but for most cases, it's people that's dead. That's toe number 13. The other toes, you know, one was lost and a couple were stolen, returned... Some just get used up. Five were swallowed, one on purpose, and I don't even want to talk about that guy. They've gone through quite a life. Full disclosure, I don't drink alcohol, so there's a little bit of special dispensation here. I still have the shot of liquor and the toe's still going in it, but I'm pouring off the liquor, and putting the toe in some ginger ale instead. I'm assured it's all within the rules. It's safe, I mean, the health inspector gives us the okay to do it. It used to be that it could be done in anything from milk to pop to champagne to beer, but in more recent years, we're sticking to straight alcohol that's 40% or higher, and that's sort of our way of appeasing the health inspector and making sure this can continue on. Now that summer's coming on, it can get pretty busy. We can do upwards of 50, 60, 70 a night. Up to now, we are at 77,888, but that's since June 11, 1995. This toe started in 1973, so the number could be 100,000. I could wax philosophical for a while on how this isn't actually this disgusting. It's just like having a bit of beef jerky in there that's being used as a garnish. And actually, the owner of the beef jerky would be much less likely to consent than the owner of the toe. But, I know what you're here for. Let's do it. Okay. So Thomas. Yes? Are you ready? I am ready. You better be. Be warned, the toe must not enter the mouth or be bitten, chewed, or God forbid, swallowed, or it's a $2,500 fine. And so, in light of the above, you can drink it fast, you can drink it slow, but your lips must touch this gnarly toe. Just your lips, no teeth, no tongue, no tonsils. Here goes. Alright, pour out the liquor. Pour out the toe. There we go. Cheers. Make sure it touches the lips. And there it is. Well done, sir. [shudders] This is the certification of your folly, sir. Thank you very much."
59,How planes stay safe over the Atlantic,"I am 35,000 feet above the North Atlantic, somewhere just south of the tip of Greenland. And there's no radar coverage up here, there's no real-time view for an air traffic controller to know where all the hundreds of planes sharing this airspace currently are. So, how do we keep safe? How do we avoid getting a bit too close to any of them? The answer is down at my destination. GPS: ""Continue for 205 miles."" This is the Nav Canada Area Control Centre in Gander, Newfoundland. And if you're over the North Atlantic, these are some of the folks keeping you safe. The North Atlantic tracks are the airways that we develop each day for our eastbound aircraft who fly across from us over to the UK area. The westbound tracks are produced by our counterpart over in Scotland via Prestwick Centre. The way the North Atlantic works, there's basically two main airflows. During the night time, our night time here, most of the aircraft leave North America and fly across to the UK. And during the daytime, most of those same aircraft return. It's a 24 hour operation obviously. We start with our day-shift, comes in early in the morning. We'll ask all these aircraft to send in their preferred routes for that night. So I'll take that into consideration. I'll also look at weather models. Eastbound aircraft, all the aircraft want to get into the main jet stream to pick up that tailwind so they can save money and fuel and time. From all that, we'll develop a set of tracks based on that flow, and once the tracks are published in the morning, airlines then have anywhere from 8 to 10, 12 hours to decide on what track they want to follow that night. The tracks can look curved and inefficient on the flat map projections we're used to but you've got to remember, they're great circle routes. They're the shortest, and cheapest way around the globe of the earth. And also, the tracks are three dimensional. Planes can be separated because they're on a different track, or because they're on different positions on the same track, or by altitude. It's a requirement for an aircraft to give us a position report every 10 degrees of longitude. And we take that information, and we apply it to the aircraft's route, and we update our system, and we can kinda predict where he's gonna be too. When there's no radar coverage, there's two main forms of communicating with the aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean. We can go through our radio operators, our flight service operators, and contact them through HF. The easiest way for us, I guess, is like a form of text message, you could call it. I can just click on a button, and I can tell exactly where that aircraft is at that point in time. It's very precise, even without radar. As a normal standard for our tracks, side-by-side, which is our lateral separation, we're running 60 nautical miles apart. As time progresses, airlines get better equipped, we'll probably have all our tracks at 30 miles apart from each other. Longitudinal, which is one aircraft behind the other, we're running 10 minutes. We can reduce that down to a five minute standard if airliners are equipped. And vertical, we're using 1,000 feet. Some nights, you can just sit out on your patio on a nice clear night, and you can see numerous aircraft, and they look like they're all on top of each other, but basically, they're all at least 1,000 feet apart, if not more. They just have to be separated in one dimension basically. As soon as an aircraft gets too tight to another aircraft, we interject and say, okay, we need to slow you down, or speed you up, traffic permitting obviously, right? If a plane has an emergency, they have contingency procedures. They have their TCAS. TCAS is their Traffic Collision Avoidance System. For instance, if you had two aircraft and an aircraft did something it wasn't supposed to do, climbed up into another aircraft, that plane has a TCAS system that says, okay you have incoming traffic, you have to climb, or descend, or whatever the resolution is, right? So as soon as we're made aware of an emergency situation, we look at separation, we try to move what aircraft we can, and we provide a conflict free clearance for that aircraft, safety being the number one thing here. Thank you very much to everyone at Nav Canada, and at the Gander Area Control Centre. You can find out more about them and the tracks at the links in the description."
60,Making an international standard cup of tea,"Loads of people have talked about the International Standard Cup of Tea. And there are hundreds of clickbait articles describing it, or ranting about how it's the wrong way to make tea, and there are lengthy infographics videos talking about it. But, as far as I can tell, no-one has actually made a Standard Cup of Tea for the internet before. And there are a couple of reasons for that: one, you have to either buy a copy of the standard or visit a library that subscribes to the Standards online so you can write down the details, and two, it requires specialist equipment. Most people in Britain make their tea by putting a teabag in a mug and then pouring boiling water on it. If you want to be fancy, then you take a pre-warmed teapot, and you put some loose-leaf tea in it, like this stuff, and then you brew the tea in there, and then you pour the results through a strainer into a cup. It's... it's fancy. But the standard, ISO 3103, doesn't ask for any of that. Instead, it uses a bit of equipment that most people won't even have heard of: which is a Professional Tea Tasting Set. Now, the standard describes it in more technical terms, diagrams, and requirements of construction and weight and size and volume, but fortunately I could just buy a set that matched the standard. And the instructions for it are actually pretty simple: you measure out 2g of tea per 100ml of water, plus or minus 2%. So for this, that means 2.8g, plus or minus .05g, which I worked out in advance because it took it ages to get it that precise. And then you combine that with either local or standardised water depending on what you're testing, by filling this little mug to the bottom of those serrations. Also, you let it steep for six minutes, which seems a bit long, but hey, that's the standard. Once your six minutes are up, you separate the 'liquor', as it's called, from the tea leaves by pouring it through the little serrations here into this cup. Let's see if I can do it... No, I can't. But close enough. They say that if you're adding milk, you should put it in first, but this is green tea, so I'm not getting involved in that debate. You drain it through there, most of the leaves stay in the cup, and once it's drained, you can inspect the tea leaves. And then you drink it not from the traditional cup, but from the bowl. There is a separate standard, ISO 1839, on how you actually sample it, and what you report. And it tastes, er... (slurps) Tastes okay. It's just okay. Because the standard isn't meant to make the perfect cup of tea, or the most British cup of tea. Every time the fact that there's a Standard for Tea does the rounds of the internet, loads of people misunderstand it as being prescriptive, and saying ""everyone should make their tea this way"", and they really shouldn't. ISO 3103 is meant to make an okay but reproducible cup of tea. It sets out instructions so that, whoever and wherever you are, you can create the same cup of tea as someone else in another time and place. For regular tea at home? Make it however you want. Stick a teabag in a mug, put the milk in first or last. Use fancy china if you want. Make your tea days in advance and then warm it up again in the microwave. Don't... don't do that. But it doesn't matter. There is no perfect cup of tea: there's only the right one for you. This here? This isn't perfect, it definitely isn't perfect, but as far as I can tell, this is the first International Standard Cup of Tea on the internet. (slurps) I don't actually like tea."
61,How formation flying works,"I'm flying a few thousand feet over Lincolnshire with the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force aerobatic team. And maybe this is patriotism talking, but they are the best aerobatic team anywhere in the world. Aircraft flying at hundreds of miles an hour just metres apart from each other. Not just in level flight either. They do things like this. Here at the Red Arrows, we fly the BAE Systems Hawk T-Mk1 powered by the Rolls Royce Adour Engine. We've flown them here in the Red Arrows since 1980 which is obviously a reasonable time, but they are perfect for what they do. They are sprightly, they're fast, they're simple to operate, and they're a pilot's aircraft. Today, we're going to have seven aircraft of our total of nine in the display. We fly 6 to 11 feet apart in the air. We're doing actually about 400 mph. The skill of formation flying is essentially triangulating a position. So you have two references that you're looking at. One at the front and one at the back of another aircraft. And as long as you line up both those references perfectly, you will be in the exact formation position. We train for approximately seven months before we even display anywhere near the public. We fly the same display for almost four months of those seven, and it's a building-block approach to get us to the stage where we are absolutely safe, professional and excellent enough to display in front of the public. So the question is: how is it possible to safely fly this close and perform manoeuvres this precise? Part of it is training, trust, and talent, but part of it is a skill that you probably already know, keeping your distance from the car in front when you're driving on a highway. It's just that instead of working in one dimension, these pilots are working in three. Or, if you count time, maybe even four. My job as a team leader is to annunciate to all the team pilots where I'm going and when I'm going to do it. So we have a very metronomic radio voice to let them know-""Coming, right, now."" ""Hold-ing-the-bank, now."" Hold-ing-the-bank, now. Everything is done on that cadence and the guys know when I'm going to make that input. The actual art of formation flying, in itself, is reasonably straight forward. So the relative motion between the aircraft is meant to be zero. And the only time that we have any relative movement between the aircraft is when we're asking the pilots to change shape. For the pilots who are up there, whilst they might be upside down at 100 feet, to them the other aircraft don't look like they're moving at all. So you can be too high or too low, which we call too shallow or deep. You can be too far forwards or too far backwards, which we call short or long. And of course, this being a three-dimensional game, you can be too close, or too tight as we call it, or too far away from the other aircraft, which is what we call wide. But it's also about timing. So we're trying to, as the Red Arrows, make it look like we're one wing that's moving beautifully in graceful formation. And to do that, the guys who are furthest away from me as the leader need to know when I'm going to turn. I expect them to have already started putting their inputs if they're along way away from me, and if they don't, they're behind the time and it's going to look like a broken chair. Every formation shape and every formation position has a different route to get out of that formation quickly and safely enough. They're what we call the escape strategies, but every manoeuvre is different. So the pilots are not only remembering which manoeuvre's next but also how to escape from that manoeuvre when it's coming up. The pilots here on my team have an inordinate amount of trust in each other. They have a prescribed piece of airspace next to the aircraft that they're formating on. That's what we call the box. And the pilot who's flying next to them trusts that they're never going to be outside of that box of formation. Thank you to the Red Arrows, to the RAF, and Rolls Royce. At some point I'll be over in their Starrship channel, so have a look at the links on screen or in the description! [laughter] Oh wow! [laughter]"
62,European clocks ran slow for a bit. British clocks didn't.,"This is a teasmade. And it is the most British invention. It's a combination alarm clock and electric kettle, which means it has two settings: alarm, and alarm with tea. And like a lot of clocks that are built into appliances, so, clocks on ovens and microwaves, and old style clock radios, and central heating systems, this clock keeps time by using the frequency of the power grid that it's connected to. Or would be connected to, anyway, obviously I don't have power out here. Power grids on this side of the Atlantic run at a frequency of 50 hertz, fifty cycles a second. Now that 50 hertz frequency might rise or fall by a tiny fraction as supply and demand affect the grid, but over the course of days and weeks the electricity companies guarantee that it'll be averaged out to 50 hertz. So clocks like this, which have to be plugged into the grid anyway, can use that regular 50-cycles-a-second beat to keep themselves accurate. Set this to the correct time, and it'll keep the correct time as long as the power's on. Except. Over the last month, clocks over in Europe have lost six minutes. If they're connected to the Continental European Power System, which is one connected, synchronised grid stretching all the way from Spain to Denmark to Turkey, if that clock is connected to that grid, it's six minutes slow. This was revealed in a press release a few days ago from the European transmission operators' association, who managed to write a press release that sounded vaguely like an angry parent who's getting close to the end of their rope. The problem is politics. Serbia and Kosovo have fallen out with each other. That is an enormous simplification, but if you think I'm going to try and explain the history of the Balkan politics system while holding a teasmade, er, you are sorely mistaken. Kosovo is low on power, Serbia isn't helping manage it, and as a result the entire European grid has been slightly underpowered since the middle of January. Not by much -but enough that the average grid frequency has dropped from 50 hertz to 49.996. So clocks like this, who are expecting 50... okay, it doesn't sound like much, but it works out to them losing six minutes over the last couple of months. Problem number one is getting the grid back up to frequency, and hopefully politics will solve that. But problem number two is: when it is fixed, should the European authorities bring the grid back to 50? Or should they run it slightly fast for a few weeks? If they do, it'll bring everything back that wasn't manually corrected... but anyone who has already changed their clocks will then find them starting to run six minutes fast. And they'll have to change them again. They're probably going to pick the second option, but who knows? Fortunately for me, I don't have to worry about it. As I'm sure 52% of Britons will be ecstatic to hear, the mainland European grid is not synchronised to the British National Grid here. It is connected, through two undersea cables, one under the English Channel from France, and the other one from the Netherlands, landing right here, on the Isle of Grain, which is near... nowhere. It's... it's absolutely in the middle of nowhere. But these cables are direct current cables, not alternating current. They doesn't require grid synchronisation. So while mainland Europe's grid is slow, our British grid is going at 50 British cycles a second, as Her Majesty intended. [""God Save the Queen"" plays] Our... our ovens are turning on at the right time. Our clock radios are remaining on time. Our... our microwaves are showing the correct time! [Music stops] Or they're showing 12:00 because no-one's bothered to program them, but that's not the point, the point is, [Music resumes] the clocks may be going slow all over Europe, but here in Britain, our teasmades are boiling precisely on schedule. God Save the Queen. And god help us all. Good! I think that's a take."
63,The moirÃ© effect lights that guide ships home,"It's difficult to research something if you don't know the name of it. I got an email a few days ago asking if I could figure out anything about this. And normally, I try to discourage messages like that, I'm not Google and I'm not a reference librarian, but this thing completely nerd-sniped me. Because other than one reference on Wikipedia to this exact light that's for shipping on Southampton Water, I couldn't find anything about it. Which is weird, because this is a really clever idea. This light is based on moirÃ© patterns, which are the extra lines and patches that seem to appear when you have two similar but slightly different patterns overlaid on each other. You see them in a few places, but most of the time they're confusing and distracting and designers want to avoid them. But here, the patterns are set up so that if you're looking straight at that light, dead on, you see parallel lines. But if you're to either side, the arrows formed by the moirÃ© patterns tell you which way to go to be straight-on to it. You can have five different boats in five different locations out there, all looking at the same sign, and they will all see arrows pointing the right way for them, without any computers or fancy tracking. This seems like such a good idea that I couldn't believe it wasn't well-known. So I went searching. ""MoirÃ© shipping light."" ""MoirÃ© boat light."" And after a half hour or so, I'd found a couple of others around the UK, placed at the entrances to locks and marinas, or at the end of dredged channels, so that people steering a boat know exactly which way to go to avoid the sides. One guide for mariners called it an ""Inogen light"" but that just led me to a medical company, nothing else. And that was it. It looked like a bit of weird maritime history that had been a brief fad and then died out, leaving no trace. A beautiful idea that the world had ignored. I considered starting a new series of videos called ""I Donât Know"" just to see if anyone knew more about it, because it's genius and, yeah, I wanted to understand it. So much that my brain wasn't quite done, I kept coming back, I kept searching. And eventually, I started looking through patent databases. And after a few minutes, I found it. It was patented by Lars Bergkvist and Ivan Forsen, from Sweden, in the late 1970s. They'd invented several things to do with moirÃ© patterns, between them. And though there are a few more patents after the first, refining the idea or making it work in two dimensions with circles, the trail ended there. I tried to track Lars or Ivan down, and couldn't find any trace. The only thing I had was an address from about forty years ago. And in Sweden. And then one little clue, spotted just out the corner of my eye, unlocked everything. Yes, this was patented by Bergkvist and Forsen, but the patent was then assigned to a company called Inogon. Not Inogen -that was a typo, or a corruption of the name over time. Inogon. This is known as an Inogon leading mark, or just an Inogon light. And once you know that, once you name it, you can search for it. You can find the US military analysis from 1986 testing that it works. The variations that were made for getting an aircraft into the right place parking in a stand. The Swedish company called FMT that now makes them, or did until recently, because they've just removed it from their web site. Once you know that this is an Inogon light, all the rest of the research becomes easy. All except one thing. This Inogon light isn't being used to guide people in. The light follows the path of an underwater cable where you shouldn't drop anchor. So the signal here is all wrong. You don't want to follow these arrows, you're required to stay away from them unless you're passing straight through. It's a really weird use for a very expensive light. So why is it here? I donât know. But if anyone out there does know, for sure, with evidence... do get in touch."
64,Canada's Most Successful King,"I find it difficult to tell stories about people sometimes, but today's guest has no such problem. I first met Evan Hadfield on a trip to the Arctic. He is a man who somehow has the ability to de-escalate any argument. Or maybe all Canadians can do that, I don't know. His channel is called Rare Earth, and he travels the world telling human stories. Evan, it's all yours. On Rare Earth, we like to take symbols from a country that maybe you've not been to yet and show how they fit into the bigger picture of your own life. And because Tom caught me at home, I want to do this on my country, on Canada. And more specifically I want to do it on a sexually repressed, hypocritical, guilt-ridden, prostitute-visiting mama's boy, our 10th Prime Minister. He's a good example of how you don't have to be great at being a person to be a great politician. What drives someone to become a politician? To me it always seemed like such a terrible job. Nobody likes you, and it really doesn't   make as much money as it seems. There isn't even really that much power in it. It's kind of like being a dentist with bad pay. But there is something you get as a politician that you can get unlike almost anywhere else, and that's a legacy. Canada's wartime prime minister is not a man we all remember fondly. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on how Asian people would never be able to integrate into other societies only to then watch them integrate into his society. Even though he was our wartime prime minister and he hated the Nazis, because of his love of the occult, he kinda felt like this Adolf guy might be the one to lead Germany to glory. A lifetime bachelor whose only sexual relations came from prostitutes that he then beat himself up over, he regularly took advice from the ghost of his dead mother, and potentially even that of his dead dog. There's some other stuff too, but you get the picture. That's our most successful guy. William Lyon Mackenzie King. He's dead now. Everyone in this story is dead now. Except me, I guess, depending on when you watch this. But at one point he was Canada's longest serving prime minister. He ran the country through the Depression and the Second World War. FDR was President for 12 years, but Mackenzie King was Prime Minister for 21. And he would have been elected again had he not aged out. By any definition, he was an incredibly successful politician. And that's the heart of this. I'm not gonna bore you with his economic plan, I'm not even gonna click-bait you with his racism and blind eye towards Hitler, because neither of those were truly  the purpose behind King's civil service. They weren't why he became a politician. What I want to  talk to you about is the driving force of legacy and the value of being weird. Now, I know what you're thinking. Weird isn't a very concise term. There is no scientific definition of weird. This is Tom Scott's channel and ""weird""  simply won't do. But he was. Pretty much everybody who knew him agreed to the point that his nickname was Weird Willy. He was a firm believer in the occult, going so far as to study his shaving cream for political omens. Churchill and Roosevelt clearly couldn't stand him even though he'd done virtually everything they'd asked. In pictures they look strained  just to be around him. Which makes sense: he was a generally uncomfortable guy to be around. Between his Norman Bates-style relationship with his mother and his constantly replacing dead dogs named Pat with live dogs named Pat, he built a name in Ottawa as one of Canada's most eccentric men. But despite his faults, King was a political mastermind. The voting public didn't really care about his personality, so long as the war, economy, and Quebec were all managed well. What they wanted was Canada's promise of peace, prosperity, and good government. And King could provide it. In spite of his faults, no one would deny that in a time of incredibly basic polling, he always somehow seemed to understand the will of the people. But I supposed he was built a bit differently, after all, government is rarely a first choice, but for King it was a calling. He believed that his dreams were visions, and he followed them. To him his life's divine purpose was to restore his family legacy. And if it took ruling the entire country to do so, that's what he was gonna do. From a young age King was obsessed with his famous grandfather, also named William Lyon Mackenzie, just without the King, which is in itself a joke because his defining moment came in trying to free Canada from the monarchy. So, you know, no King in the name?... you get it. In the mid-1800s with Mackenzie as the mayor of Toronto, rebels hiding out in the US declared themselves the Republic of Canada, and invaded it. Their intent was overthrowing British rule in favour of an independent state, or, depending on how the QuÃ©bÃ©cois fared, states. Once free of British tyranny, these states would presumably be gobbled up by their neighbour to the south, but it wasn't to be. Britain won. William Lyon Mackenzie's memory, and the Republic he stood for,  died with little fanfare. He remained in public life but was essentially forgotten. It's possible he'd remain that way to this day if not for his grandson. At his grandfather's graveside in Toronto, that weird occult mama's boy began a journey that would redefine this country. It would redefine the legacy his ancestor left behind. Sure, it wasn't yet a fire, but his grandfather's rebellion had sparked something in Canada. Soon afterwards we'd be voting for our own prime minister. King would be the 10th. And really his timing was perfect. It would be an American century and it didn't take a fortune teller to see that. Canadians had been warming to the idea of a new mother country, a new empire to bow to. At the turn of the 20th century, the Republican ideals that had driven those rebels less than 100 years before were stronger than ever. Having been dragged head first into World War I without a vote, devastated by indifferent British generals, Canada was ready to change best friends. We may have won the war, but Britain had asked us to give everything for her, everything, for a war that meant nothing. In a population of under eight million, over half a million of us went to Europe. My family died in Europe. The next time we'd vote, we had a leader who wasn't afraid to say no to Britain, to say no to conscription. We'd never be forced into war without a vote again, not for Britain, not for our new friend America. Mother could no longer come calling. To the people, that right had died in Ypres. But to Mackenzie King, it died with his grandfather. Those days were over. Whether it was through his own backbone or the will of his voters, King led us into a new era. He saw himself not as a person but as a vessel for legacy, and in turn we voted for him, not as a person, but as a vessel for legacy, just ours, not his. William Lyon Mackenzie King was not a good person. He wasn't even really good at being a person. He was weird, nobody liked him, and he died alone. But he changed this country's future because there's one thing you can get as a politician unlike anywhere else, even if you're weird, and that's a legacy. And that's the point of today's episode. The drive that leads us to glory. Maybe it was just a case of 'right place, right time', perhaps he was little more than an expression of the changing national mood. I'm certainly not saying that the key to good politics is poor behaviour or acting strangely, but it worked in its time. When you strip everything away, Mackenzie King's grandfather wanted Canada and the United States to be friends. A strange man sacrificed his whole life towards personal ends, and as a result, here we are: friends. A weirdo may have led us there, but it doesn't really matter who he was, and he knew that, because the legacy remains. Thanks for listening, everybody. This is Rare Earth.

65,A Language Made Of Music,"For the first time ever, this week's guest video uses art and animation. 12tone is a channel about music theory that uses pen and paper, and piano notes, and doodles of elephants, but today they are also talking about language. 12tone: [beeps]! Hey, welcome to 12tone! Or, to put that another way: [piano notes]! Ok, that may have sounded like a nice but strange melody, but it was actually a sentence in La Langue Musicale Universelle, or the Universal Musical Language, also known as Solresol. Solresol was invented in the mid-19th century by a French musician named Jean-FranÃ§ois Sudre, who'd become fascinated with the idea of a language made of music. His first attempt, which he called La Telephonie, was fairly straightforward: He just took the French alphabet and assigned each letter to a musical note. This wasn't really a new language, though. It was more like a code, and it found its home where most codes do: the military. Sudre tried to sell his system to the French Army and, later, the Navy, but despite early interest, they never actually paid him for it. He even built a series of properly-tuned cannons in order to increase the volume of his transmissions, but to no avail. Still, though, he wasn't about to give up on his dream. Instead, he set his sights on an even more ambitious task: A universal second language. His goal was to create a language that was bound to no particular country, one that every person learned in addition to their native tongue, allowing free communication across cultural borders. But just converting French into a musical code wasn't good enough for that. Sudre was going to have to invent a real language. To do this, he turned to a system of musical notation known as solfÃ¨ge. This is that Do-Re-Mi stuff Julie Andrews was singing about. Well, almost: In The Sound Of Music, the notes are Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti, Do, which is the English method, but most other countries in Europe use ""Si"" instead, and since Sudre was French, that's what he did. Anyway, having so few possible syllables presents a fairly obvious problem. In English, it's hard to even guess how many single-syllable words there are, but one estimate I found puts it at roughly 7,000. Solresol, on the other hand, has 7. These are reserved for only the most basic elements of communication, like ""yes"", ""no"", ""and"", and ""the"". Two-syllable words aren't much better: there's 49 possible combinations, used for things like pronouns, greetings, and common descriptors like ""good"" and ""bad"". They're also used for conjugation: Solresol can't fit a bunch of different words for each verb, so instead it has one verb form, the present, and then just uses a set of two-syllable words to tell you about the tense. But where things get really interesting are the larger words, which have the room to build in some structures. Three-syllable words are loosely divided into groups of 6, based on the first two notes. Words starting with Sol-Si are based on fun and games, including ""run"", ""laugh"", and ""smile"". Words starting with Re-La, on the other hand, are negative traits like ""misanthropy"", ""distrust"", and ""intolerance"". At four syllables, he takes this concept to a whole new level, breaking all the words up into seven groups, called keys, based on their first syllable. The key of Do, for instance, is all about humanity, including the body, mind, and spirit. The key of Re is for words about the household and family, Mi is for actions and flaws, Fa is for travel and war, Sol is for art and science, La is for industry, and Si is for government. There's also a second set of keys that come up when your word includes a note repeated twice in a row, although their meanings are usually related to the main key. And that's it. Sudre's language only went up to 4 syllables, with less than 3000 total words. The fifth syllable was left open for future development, in case new words were needed, but by carefully removing things like synonyms, tense, and parts of speech, which are managed exclusively through accents rather than new words, he managed to squeeze quite a lot of meaning into just those 3,000. Sadly, while Sudre's work made him famous, at least in certain circles, it never repaid him for the time and money he put into it. To quote the writer Paul Collins, ""Solresol is, at heart, the philanthropic effort of an idealist â ""and the Brotherhood of Mankind does not issue quarterly dividend checks."" After Sudre's death, though, his wife Josephine took up the cause, and the language started to pick up steam, with thousands of speakers and a society for its preservation founded in Paris, culminating in 1902 with the publication of a guide to its grammar by the head of the society, Boleslas Gajewski. But the dream of a true universal language was fading, so preservationists focused on another of Sudre's selling points: accessibility. You see, Solresol doesn't actually have to be based on music. It's got seven characters, and can be grafted onto any set of seven items, like the seven colors of the rainbow or, more importantly, seven specific hand gestures. This meant that anyone who knew the spoken language could easily learn it as a sign language as well, making it an incredibly useful tool in communicating with deaf people. Gajewski's guide emphasized this possibility, but there was a problem: At the time, deaf education in Europe was dominated by a philosophy called oralism, which is basically the idea that deaf people should still learn to speak, and that teaching them sign languages got in the way. To be clear, this is no longer considered a reasonable approach, but for Gajewski, it meant that the language he loved was cut off from the people it could help the most. So who knows, maybe if turn-of-the-century educators in France had been a bit more forward-thinking, we'd all be speaking in notes right now. Probably not. But maybe. [piano notes] 12tone: [beeps]!

66,Sign Language Isn't Universal,"For this week's guest video, you're probably going to need subtitles. So if they're not on automatically, you can turn them on in your device settings. And you'll need them because this week's guest is Rikki Poynter, a deaf vlogger who makes videos in both English and American Sign Language. She has asked me to apologise for accidentally fingerspelling in front of her face a couple of times here, apparently that can be rude. So, Rikki: [signs in BSL:] Over to you! Hello! As youâve read from the title,  sign language is not universal. For many years now, Iâve seen many comments  from people on the Internet thinking that thereâs only one  sign language in the whole world. Butâ¦ theyâre wrong. There are actually about more than  300 sign languages in the entire world. Even all English speaking countries  donât share the same sign language. For example, the United States speaks English  and uses American Sign Language. England also speaks English,  but do they use ASL? No, they use BSL. Why is ASL different from BSL? ASL is more like or based off LSF  (French Sign Language) as the first sign language teacher in the U.S., L... er -Laurent Clerc, was from France. He came to the U.S. to teach and thus ASL was born. Here are some more examples:  Australia uses Auslan. Canada does use ASL;  however, Quebec actually uses LSQ. Now, hereâs an exception. While sign language isnât exactly universal, there is this thing called  International Sign or IS. This is typically used in big events  where deaf people from all over gather. For example, Deaflympics. Oh, hey, I spelled it right. But itâs important to know that IS also differs. It's also not the same everywhere. Of course, just like you may see  similarities in spoken languages, you will see them in various sign languages. For example, the ASL sign for âIâm sorryâ is this. Youâll see the same one used in BSL. Sometimes, youâll see a sign  used in multiple sign languages. âWhere?â in ASL is âWhat?â in BSL. Naturally, people wonder, âWhy canât we have just one sign language?  Wouldnât it be easier that way?â If that happened, that would make things boring. Yes, it would probably make things easier, but we already have different spoken languages,  so why not have different sign languages? Different cultures and languages make life interesting. It makes us all unique. When it comes to deaf history, thereâs a lot of detail. But if you want to learn more,  I definitely encourage you to do so. It can be difficult to keep it condensed for a video. I hope you all learned something new today. Thank you all for watching and thank you, Tom, for allowing me  to be here to make this video for you. Maybe Iâll see you all later? Bye! Go subscribe to Rikki's channel! And remember, she's a vlogger: that is a channel about her life, not just ""all your sign language questions answered""! I figure I should set expectations there. Next week, a video that's a little bit related but also a little bit musical."
67,The null hypothesis,"There's an idea in science called the null hypothesis. And it works like this: when you're setting out to prove a theory, your default answer should be, ""It's not going to work,"" and you've got to convince the world otherwise through clear results. So in my last video, while I was trying to talk to a camera up on that zero-g flight, the student researchers all through the rest of the plane, who were physicists, psychologists, chemists, electrical engineers, all of them were trying to disprove their null hypothesis. We want to see if brain-computer interfaces can be used for very extreme situations, such as space. and that zero-g or weightlessness will not really interfere with the signalling, and if it does, how can we filter it out? In the flights, the participants are going to play a game called ""shoot-the-alien"" and they'll do so with their brain activity. Simply put, they'll just think of movements and not actually move and by thinking of that movement, they'll control a little cannon on a screen. If I really move my right hand, I get a certain brain signal but if I imagine moving my right hand, I get the exact same brain signal. That means that I can learn a computer how to respond to those brain signals even if I'm not really doing anything at all. That's why it's usable for people who are actually paralysed or suffer from other types of illnesses. We're not actually reading someone's mind but we're measuring their brain signals. We have a cap, which has 64 electrodes to actually measure those brain signals through the skull, and through a special gel that we put in. The cap is actually quite comfortable once it's on. You don't actually feel it anymore so it's just measuring there. It's not going to bother them. At least we hope it's not! In theory, getting a negative result is a good thing. And for the BrainFly team, that would be brain activity in microgravity being too different for the system to detect. Now, as long as the equipment worked, that isn't a failure. That just means your idea has been proven wrong. That's still a step forward. But, in practice, humans don't work that way. It's called publication bias. Negative results are less likely to be written up by scientists, less likely to be published by journals and less likely to make it out to the rest of the world. The media doesn't care if nothing's changed. Scientific institutions have limited money and getting flashy, amazing results that generate lots of press coverage... oh, that's good for your career. So if you're putting all that time and money in, there is still a stigma that, if you get a negative result, you have somehow failed. We do hope to publish. We hope to get, maybe at least, four papers actually, because we all have different thesis subjects on it. In the best case scenario, everything works perfectly. The BCI's still controllable, the data's not noisy, all nine participants give perfect data. That's the dream result. My ideal result is actually this little tiny brain signal called a P300, which is a positive peak in your electrical signal. So what I think and what I hope is that microgravity, the moment when you're weightless, may result in a slight cognitive enhancement. So up there, in those 20 second bursts of microgravity, those researchers tried to disprove their null hypothesis. For BrainFly, that is: is our brain activity comparable in zero G? Can you still use a brain-computer interface if you're in orbit? In a few decades, could astronauts doing space walks use their minds to control equipment? I'm not going to tell you. You can look it up when they all publish their papers because the achievement is the same, regardless of the results. Science has taken one small step forward, no matter whether they disprove their null hypothesis or not. Nah, I'm just kidding, they got the results they wanted. If you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and you want to be one of the people behind me, then have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program. The link is in the description!"
68,Batman's village of fools,"Iâve got a story for you that stretches over 700 years, and the best way to start it is with a 16th century joke: ""a man did ride to the market with two bushels of wheat"". But because his horse shouldnât carry a heavy load, he carried the wheat on his own neck, but still rode the horse. Iâm not saying itâs a great 16th century joke. But that is one of the Merry Tales of the Mad-Men of Gotam, a 16th-century compilation of stories insulting the intelligence of the people of this town. Which is pronounced ""goat-um"". The jokes compiled in that book date back centuries more, and while the details have changed with retellings over the years, the story behind them goes like this: Back in the early 13th century, King John â the King John from the tales of Robin Hood â wanted to travel through this town. The locals were worried, because if the King travelled on a road, it would become a public highway, and they didnât want that. Or in other retellings, the King wanted to build a hunting lodge somewhere nearby, and the locals would have to pay for it. So whenever royal messengers arrived in Gotham, they found the locals doing something ridiculous. They tried to capture a cuckoo by building a circular hedge around it, and when the bird flew away, decided they just hadnât built the hedge high enough. They tried to kill an eel by drowning it. Back then, ""madness"" was thought to be contagious. If the King was to visit this town, then who knows: he might catch whatever they had. The king stayed away, and the locals won. So the full legend tells the tale of a wily group of people who outwitted the Kingâ¦ but who also became known as a village of fools in the process. They were both the Wise Men of Gotham and the Mad Men of Gotham. Centuries later, in the early 1800s, there was an American writer called Washington Irving. Heâs best known now for writing the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but among many other things, he was a satirist, and in one of his early works he refers to New York City as Gotham. Now, I tracked down that bit of writing, and I can't understand it. I donât know any of the context. I don't know if heâs calling the citizens of New York dim, or clever, or both. But the nickname he gave New York stuck around in the public consciousness â and it was written down, so at some point, ""Goat-um"" became ""Goth-am"". More than a century after that, when comic book writer Bill Finger was looking for a name for Batmanâs fictional town, he flipped through the New York City phone book, spotted âGotham Jewellersâ, and thought: thatâs perfect. So now we have Gotham City. If one link in that chain had broken, through 13th-century legend, to 16th-century insult book, to 19th-century writer, to 20th-century phone book flip, if one of those small events hadnât happened, Batman would live somewhere else."
69,Hold music used to sound better. Here's why.,"If you're on hold to a company, and they're playing music down the phone at you, the chances are it sounds terrible, and sometimes it just dissolves into static. Telephone signals are not designed to carry music, and to explain why, we have to start way, way back with old telephone equipment like this. Early telephone calls were put through by a human operator who would be literally connecting the two phone wires into one circuit at a big board of switches. Or a ""switchboard"". Any sound at one end, whether it's speech, music, whatever, would be converted to an electrical signal, sent down the wire, and converted back at the other end. You send music, you receive music -although it'd be limited by the abilities of the tiny microphone and speaker. But telephone exchanges like this only work for small numbers of connections. Because, you know, you can't do this for every call. [PHONE RINGS] Phone companies quickly realised that they could save on setting up thousands of wires between exchanges miles apart if they were able to put several conversations down one wire at the same time. So rather than transmit every frequency of sound in the original signal, they would cut off the high and low frequencies, the ones we don't absolutely need to understand speech, and then they would shift each call into a different frequency band. At at the other end, like tuning in a radio, they would shift each call back to the right frequencies so you could hear it. I mean, the quality wasn't great, but it was good enough. And hey, we got cheap long distance calling. We got used to that phone-quality sound. [EXCHANGE CLICKS] And it became the standard. So already [PHONE RINGS] music was going to sound a bit dodgy, with all the high and low frequencies cut off. But while we were still running on analogue circuits [EXCHANGE RESETS] it wasn't going to sound like static. That was the fault of computers. Phone companies realised that they could send even more calls down the same wire, or into the same airspace on a cellular network, if they used computers to compress the audio. And the more they compressed it, the more calls they could fit at the same time, and the cheaper it'd be for them. These days, there is enough power in pretty much everyone's phone to compress 4K video in real time, but back then, not so much. MP3s had only just been invented, and these do not have enough power to compress those. The standards for phone calls, even today, rely on quick-and-dirty compression built decades ago, designed to run on very little computing power, and optimised for speech. That compression is great at encoding one clear voice -but chuck a load of complicated music at it, with all its instruments [COMPRESSED MUSIC] and it's going to sound bad. But not quite enough to break down into static. There is one last piece of the puzzle. Someone else cutting corners. Because in the worst case, that hold music isnât just compressed by the phone company on its way to you. Itâs already been compressed by a completely different system as your call bounces around a companyâs internal phone network. An internal phone network that has probably been built by the lowest bidder. So the phone company takes that already-mangled signal and mangles it in a different way as it travels to you. And in a really badly designed system, maybe thereâs an entire third layer of terrible compression from whichever other company runs the call centre that you're actually talking to, off in some other country. [MUSIC RISES] Speech can survive that chain But music... [MUSIC TURNS TO STATIC] ...music can't! Thank you so much to all the team at the Milton Keynes Museum and their Connected Earth gallery, where pretty much all this telephone exchange equipment is just open to play around with. Pull down the description for more about them. This is not a TARDIS. This is literally just a police telephone box."
70,"What Is Sea Level, Anyway?","Welcome to Calipatria, a desert town near California's Salton Sea. This is the city with the lowest elevation in the western hemisphere, 55 metres below sea level. And here, we've also got a visual demonstration of just what that means: because that white spindly thing is a flagpole, and the American flag up at the top is flying above sea level. If it wasn't for all the mountains and hills between here and the Pacific Ocean, then we'd be wet, but that flag would stay dry. Maybe. We're dry because no rivers drain into this basin. The Salton Sea over there only exists because some engineers screwed up in 1905 and diverted a good bit of the Colorado River in there for a couple of years. That water is steadily getting saltier and more polluted as it slowly evaporates, and California's got to deal with that over the next couple of decades. But how do we know we're 55 metres below sea level? What is sea level? In theory, it is the average height of the sea around the Earth. But there are some problems with that. Problem 1: the Earth isn't a sphere. I mean, it's vaguely a sphere, don't get too excited, Flat-Earthers. It's a bit squashed. The force of its own spin makes it bulge by a few kilometres around the equator. And when you're defining height above sea level in metres, that's a lot. So geographers solved that by defining the Earth as an oblate spheroid. Basically a smooth squashed sphere, just in fairly precise mathematical terms. But then there's problem 2: the Earth isn't one uniform lump of rock. Bits of the mantle are more dense than others, so gravity isn't quite the same everywhere on Earth's surface. Which means there's a bit more water sitting over those bits. And by a bit more, I mean anything up to 80 metres more. These aren't small amounts, that could be the difference between this city being above and below sea level. And to complicate things even more, mountains are big enough that their gravity attracts the ocean, just a little. So during the 20th century, as scientists and Cold War governments started to need a global reference system for spacecraft, and missiles, which were basically the same thing back then, they spent a long time measuring Earth's gravity. The result is the Earth Gravitational Model, megabytes in size, which asks, in purely mathematical terms: if this land wasn't here, but its gravity was, and if there was exactly enough water to fill in the gaps... where would all that water sit? And how far away would it be from that theoretical smooth squashed sphere? The model was finished in 1996. It is available to this day on a web site that seems unchanged since 1996, and it's what your phone and GPS use. There are more recent, more precise models, but they are hundreds of megabytes in size, and everyone's agreed that now we've got a standard, let's not change it and confuse everyone. Also, we'd also have to update for sea level rise, whether it's best-case centimetres or worst-case metres. So saying we're ""55 metres below sea level"" is mostly just symbolic. But so are many things in the world, and I'd like to think we still put some trust in them."
71,The centuries-old debt that's still paying interest,"In 1648, the Water Board of Lekdijk Bovendams needed to repair these embankments to make sure that this bit of the Netherlands didn't flood. For that, they needed money, so they sold a bearer bond. Whoever owned that bond would get a little bit of money back from them every year. But, unlike modern bonds, they didn't set a time limit on that. Perpetual debt can be a thing in finance. It's kind of like selling stock in a company, but normally perpetual just means until the company fails. But, this company didn't fail. 3Â½ centuries later, that original bond ended up.... GPS: ""Take exit 47."" ...here, at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, USA, and it's still paying interest. Perpetual bonds date back to the Middle Ages. All bonds were perpetual bonds and the fact that bonds actually mature and pay back their principal is a financial innovation. The flood plains of rivers, they don't coincide with state boundaries or city boundaries, so they had separate governments that would oversee the levees. These organisations would have the power of taxation. Everybody who was protected by a levee would pay taxes to pay for their upkeep. And they would never go to war, so the combination of being able to tax people and not going to war, which usually bankrupts governments, makes that these bonds are still paying interest until today. Tax collections would have fell short of the budget they needed, so they issued this bond. The water board, which dates back to, I think, 1328 has been merged in larger and larger organisations. They have recombined these water boards and now it's called Stichtse Rijnlanden which pays the interest on the bond. These annotations here are the annual interest payments that have been taking place since 1648. As you go to the other side, you see that the whole other side is also full with little markings which are the interest payments that have taken back over the years. At some point, the bond was full. There was no more space, and they issued this piece of paper here which is a continued marking of the interest payments. When Yale bought the bond in 2003, and we collected our interest payment, you see that the last interest payment had been taken place in 1976. So, there was 27 years of back interest that was due. We left the bond here for 12 years, and then, in 2015, we collected '04, '05, '06, all the way down to 2015. Well, there was actually a picture somewhere of me in Holland where I hold the bond in one hand and I got interest payments for Yale with my other hand as the bearer of the bond. It's a little disappointing. The bond initially was for 1,000 carolus guilders. Carolus guilders became other guilders, I think. They became, now, Euros. At some point, they lowered the interest payments a bit. So, to make a long story short, every year, we get â¬11.35 interest payment on this bond. You know, the value of this bond, obviously, is in the fact that it's live. It's probably just as exciting for them as it is for us to be able to present the bond and have an opportunity to pay interest. Now, the Dutch water authority could probably default on the debt if they wanted to. It costs more than the bond is worth to fly someone over every couple of decades. And let's face it, Yale would be unlikely to launch an international lawsuit. But, for about one Euro a month, the Water Authority gets to be part of a weird bit of living financial history, and get a bit of good publicity out of it too. It might not be a subscription they'd take out deliberately, but apparently, for them, it's worth it. I think they have a pretty good track record. They sound like a triple-A organisation to me, and I think we're going to be good for a while."
72,The US government will sell you freeze-dried urine,"This is a packet and bottle of freeze-dried urine, and the United States government will sell it to you for $983, plus shipping. Which is perhaps the strangest sentence I've ever started a video with, but itâs true. What's even stranger is: thatâs a pretty reasonable price. These are two of more than 1,000 Standard Reference Materials that are kept here at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Here at NIST, we produce Standard Reference Materials or SRMs for short. SRMs are super characterised materials that our customers use to make sure their measurements on their materials and processes are accurate and reliable. When a customer buys one of our SRMs, they get both a unit of material and a certificate of analysis. Each property, whether itâs a chemical constituent or a physical characteristic of the material is a certified property and it's measured most accurately. The certificate of analysis is just as important as the material itself. Without the certificate and all the information thatâs inside of it, the SRM is just another bottle of stuff. We have a variety of food materials in our SRM catalogue, so this is slurried spinach. When you slurry the spinach, it's nice and homogenous. You sample a little bit from the top, itâs the same as sampling from the bottom. We also have our infamous domestic sludge, from a waste water treatment process, that has been dried, ground up, homogenised into this nice, fine powder. We take this material. We certify various toxic elements within the sludge, thatâs what itâs used for. We also have the microsphere slide that contains the space beads. They're 10 micron-wide, polystyrene spheres that were formed on the space shuttle in zero gravity. We have to store some of our more sensitive materials in cryocooled conditions. We have our peanut butter, right there in a glass jar. Oh, itâs crackling. Then, we have our whale blubber, organics in whale blubber. This is actually whale blubber tissue from a beached whale. It's for tracking organic contaminants in the environment, and whales are the end of the food chain. Every one of these reference materials has to be exactly the same, to an incredibly precise margin. Theyâll be used by people around the world to calibrate and test machinery. Now, other places make reference materials too. It's just that everything in this warehouse has the US Government stamp of approval on it. Now, just to be clear, the vast majority of reference materials here are pretty dull. They're for industrial processes, so they're metal, or glass, or pure elements. There are three types of bauxite: from Suriname, Jamaica or the Dominican Republic. There's even really precise mixes of gases available, along with some radioactive elements. Sometimes, it takes us years to actually procure a new material that becomes an SRM a couple of years later. We buy industrial products directly. It comes from a different source each time we make it, but we make it the same way, and we characterise it in the same fashion. Either we determine the chemical composition or its physical characteristics, but we do that with accuracy. In other cases, we have SRMs that are used to determine how they break. We measure over and over again, with different methods, to ensure that what we're measuring is the true value in that particular material. The material itself is not precise. The measurements that characterise it are precise. So if you havenât worked it out yet, the reason that freeze-dried urine is one of the reference materials is because there are folks out there with machines that test urine. They're either testing for drugs, so the Institute will sell you urine laced with exact amounts of the metabolites of cannabis or cocaine, or they're testing for poisons and toxic elements. So if you need to calibrate one of those testing machines, to make sure that the results are accurate, then the folks here are the ones you're going to call. Thank you to everyone here at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Pull down the description for more about Standard Reference Materials and about their work."
73,What counts as a mountain?,"I'm at the summit of Mount Evans in Colorado, USA. It is one of the Colorado Fourteeners, meaning I'm more than 14,000 feet above sea level. As Americans measure it. For the rest of the world, that is 4.3 kilometres above sea level, or about half way to an airplane's cruising altitude. And the air up here is thin: I'm only getting about 60% of the oxygen that I normally do each time I breathe in. And let me tell you, this was a difficult climb. At least, the last bit of it was. Because this is also the most American mountain, becacuse there is a road to the top of it. The highest paved road in North America. And this summit here counts as the 41st highest mountain in North America. But how do we count that? Just over there, the wonderfully named Meyer-Womble Observatory is on another, slightly lower summit. But it's surrounded by lower ground: why doesn't that count as the 42nd highest? And you might say, well, the answer's obvious, it's part of the same mountain. But where does that end? This summit, Mount Evans, is just a smaller part of a big mountain range, so you could try and make the case that this is just a bump on the way to the tallest peak in the Rockies, Mount Elbert. Or you could take it to the extreme and say that there's only one mountain on each land mass, that every other peak in North America is just a small bump on the way to the enormous continent-sized mountain called Denali. Now that's ridiculous, most people would say. It's obvious. That's a mountain. And that isn't. But in formal terms, we solve it by measuring prominence. Prominence works like this: imagine if you could raise sea level up to where I'm sitting now. How many meters would it have to drop before you could connect this mountain to another, taller one and walk there without getting your feet wet? For Mount Evans, that is 839m down, or about one-fifth of its height above sea level. That observatory summit? It's not prominent. Sure, you have to walk downhill from it, but after a few meters you're going uphill again. So where do you draw the line? Well, there are several different lines, because of course there are. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation defines a mountain as needing 300m of prominence, which is actually only the height of the Eiffel Tower, which... doesn't seem like much to me? Other folks disagree, and say it should be 500m, or that prominence should change with altitude... it's a mess. I'll be honest, even after researching this, I'm not sure about it. Even the folks I asked to check my script went, ""eh, well, I guess, basically, but technically..."" This is one of those times that the human need to categorise and catalogue everything runs up against messy reality. There are always edge cases, and pretty much every mountain is an edge case. I'm going to go back down now before I get altitude sickness(!)"
74,I can't show you how pink this pink is.,"You're not seeing this pink. Not properly. This camera can't capture it, YouTube can't store it, and your screen can't display it. I'm in the studio of artist Stuart Semple, and he's made what he calls the Pinkest Pink. I've been painting since I was five years old, and I've seen a lot of pink. And thousands and thousands of people have used the pink, and nobody's said they've seen a pinker pink. This stuff's really pink. I've created the pinkest pink, the greenest green, the loveliest blue, and the yellowest yellow. I've also created the world's most glittery natural glitter and the mattest blackest art material in the world. About a year and a half ago, a company called Surrey Nanosystems announced that they'd created Vantablack, which was this really awesome blacker-than-the-blackest-black black but they gave the exclusive rights to an artist called Anish Kapoor to use it, and that annoyed a lot of artists, and I got really annoyed as well. So I put my Pinkest Pink out. On the web site I put a disclaimer that you weren't Anish Kapoor, you weren't associated with Anish Kapoor. A lot of people thought that was quite funny and a lot of people bought the pink unfortunately including Anish Kapoor, who managed to get his hands on it and then he dipped his finger in it and put it on Instagram that he'd got the pink. It was sort of great and sort of really frustrating when he did that, because all of a sudden we were getting thousands and thousands of orders we ended up staying up for about four weeks making pink paint and nothing else could happen and it just took over our whole life. There are all sorts of complicated and clever ways that computers can store colour, but by the time this video reaches your screen it's basically just a series of numbers that say how bright to make each of the red, green and blue pixels, the tiny lights that make up your screen. And unless you've got a really fancy, expensive screen, those numbers run from 0 to 255 -which is eight 1s in binary. 0 means turn the pixel off, 255 means as bright as it can go. That means your screen can show somewhere around 16 million colours. But that's not every colour. And it's not this one. Because if I pointed this camera at the sun, you wouldn't be blinded. The numbers can't go above 255, I can't make your screen go brighter than 100%. And if I point it at something extremely dark, the number can't go below 0. I can't make your screen any darker than if it was turned off. In the same way, there are colours that are so intense your screen can't display them, the pixels cannot go red, green or blue enough. And this is one of them. There are massive libraries of pigments, organic ones, inorganic ones, synthetic ones, created ones, natural ones, and they've been digging them up since day dot. 'Mummy brown' was made out of ground-up mummies. So there's a huge database of pigments that you can order. And you can play with them. I've made mixes of these pigments and binders, created something, tweaked it, and gone back and got these relationships right. So it's quite a complicated little potion, actually. In a few years' time, technology will move on. It's already possible to buy expensive equipment with a wider colour gamut, and that might be able to display this pink. But in the meantime, I can try and simulate what being here is like. In this shot, this one here, I've digitally adjusted the saturation of this pink so it's not quite as intense. Now if I turn it back up... Imagine that change, but more so. That's how pink this pink is. It is ridiculously pink. Thank you to Stuart Semple and all the team at his workshop: pull down the description for more about them, their pigments, and this pink. This is gorgeous! I cannot get over how luminous this is. I started out, like, ""well, this isn't doing anything, this is just powder"" and then it just goes!"
75,Why old screens make a Ê°á¶¦áµÊ° áµá¶¦áµá¶Ê°áµáµ noise,"Last week, I put up a video that was filmed here at the Cambridge Centre for Computing History. And folks seemed to like the video, but a few comments made it clear that there was a slight problem. And it was a problem that made me really angry with myself. There was a very subtle high-pitched noise in the background of the video, and I hadn't noticed it before uploading. So I thought I should explain why: first, why the noise was there at all, and second, why I didn't notice it. This museum is filled with old computers with cathode ray tube screens: CRTs. Some of these screens are specialised computer monitors, but others, like these over here, are basically just old-school televisions. At the back of each monitor is an electron gun, and it fires out a beam of electrons. Wherever they hit, the phosphors on the screen light up. But the electron gun doesn't move at all. It couldn't possibly move fast enough. Instead, it just fires in one direction, and electromagnets bend the beam of electrons. The more power that's sent to the magnets, the more the beam bends. So for every frame of video, that beam scans the whole screen, left to right, top to bottom. I'm going to ignore the vertical movement, what we're interested in is the horizontal. Inside there is a clever bit of kit called a flyback transformer. It outputs a sawtooth signal to the electromagnet, which means that it ramps up, and then drops very quickly back down. And as it ramps up, the electromagnet bends the beam across the screen before it quickly snaps straight back ready for the next line. That electron beam scans across 625 lines of the TV signal, 25 times a second, so that flyback transformer needs to ramp up and drop down 15,625 times a second. And because of something called magnetostriction, it changes shape a tiny, tiny, tiny amount every time it does that, which generates a noise at that high-pitched frequency. It's the same frequency that every old-school TV produces. At least in Europe. The numbers in America are a little different, but they still end up at about the same frequency. Now, with modern audio editing tools it is really easy to isolate that frequency and remove it. Until now, I've been removing it from this video, but let me tell you: it's here, and in this room, with all these monitors on, it is loud. Now I knew the sound was recorded originally, because I could hear it in this room, I knew my microphone was picking it up. I just thought the automatic noise reduction stuff I use would take care of it. It didn't: but it also turns out these headphones that I use to check audio aren't great at high frequencies, and so with my voice drowning it out I just didn't notice the sound. There aren't many quiet bits in that video, I don't shut up. And for a while, I was angry with myself, because it was an unforced error. I wasn't under time pressure, I checked through half a dozen times, I just didn't think to check the sound with my eyes. That mistake might have stopped the message getting as far as it could. But I think there was another reason that I was angry. Spider Robinson once wrote that ""anger is fear in disguise"", and I'm not sure that's always true, but... it wasn't just my headphones. As you get older, your range of hearing  starts to narrow. It starts to get more difficult to hear high frequencies. And I used to pride myself on how good my hearing was, I could hear higher frequencies than I was supposed to for my age. Those 17,000Hz mosquito alarms designed to make teenagers go away, they irritated me through my twenties. And, sure, I can hear the loud, high-pitched noise here, 'cos it's really obvious, but in that video? Nope. I have to strain to even notice it, even as some folks in the comments said it was loud enough to stop them watching. I did a hearing test. I can't hear mosquito alarms any more. I can't hear anything higher than these monitors. That video, that mistake I made, was a sudden and sharp reminder that I'm getting older. That some of the things I used to do, I can't any more. So protect your hearing, and next time someone forgets to check for a high pitched noise in the background and it annoys you... well, at least you can still hear it."
76,The Runways of Fire That Let WW2 Planes Land In Fog: FIDO,"This used to be RAF Graveley, a Royal Air Force base near Cambridge. Now, it's a farm and some wind turbines, but in the 1940s aircraft would set off from here to fight in Europe. And, they hoped, they'd be able to safely land back here as well. The problem with that was the fog. Or, rather, smog: all the soot and air pollution from domestic coal fires combined with fog to make an incredibly thick ""pea soup"". It's never seen in modern Britain because we don't burn smoke-producing coal in every house any more. But back then, if that smog came in, even runway lights wouldn't get through it and there were no modern instruments to guide the air crews home. No way to take off, no way to land. How do you solve that? By setting enormous amounts of petrol on fire. This incredible photo shows a Lancaster bomber taking off from just behind me, more than 70 years ago. It looks like a movie stunt, but this was how wartime airfields boiled off fog. Set up enormous lines of petrol burners to heat up the air, vaporise all the liquid water droplets to make steam, which will rise out of the way and clear the air. The system was called FIDO. âFog, Intensive, Dispersal Of.â There are demonstration films taken by the RAF on clear days, showing just how big and how visible this was. There's a report in The War Illustrated, published just after victory in Europe, that says that the glow from the fires was visible for miles. There was a bit of smoke when they started the system up, but once it got hot, the air could be so clear that people on the ground could see the stars. The catch was how expensive it was. A small Fido system burne 70,000 gallons of fuel an hour. One estimate says that in one foggy night over England, all the Fido systems in use would burn 20 million gallons of fuel. There's even a report all the extra heat pumped into the atmosphere triggered a thunderstorm. At the current price of jet fuel, as I record this, running a Fido system would cost about $200,000 per hour per runway. It was never used in peacetime: aircraft could just not take off instead and wait for the fog to clear, or divert to another airport if they were trying to land. But for the war effort, to let planes take off for battle in any weather and to save thousands of air crew lives who needed to land right now: it was worth it."
77,Why sci-fi alien planets all look the same,"I am exactly thirty miles away from the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and North La Cienega Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles. This is part of the boundary of the studio zone, a thirty-mile circle that sweeps through southern California, and which explains why a lot of planets in science fiction look kind of the same. See, if I were filming a movie and I asked my cast and crew to meet me here, outside the zone, I'd have to pay them for their time and mileage getting to the location. But if I just walk a few paces this way, inside the studio zone, then cast and crew get paid from when they arrive here, from their call time. Filming inside the zone is significantly cheaper. The headquarters of pretty much all the movie studios are inside the zone, and so are a lot of places that you'll have seen in film and television. Griffith Park and Bronson Canyon are well within the zone, close to the centre of Hollywood, so that's where Adam West's Batcave was, along with where the walls fell for Captain Picard, and along with, well, pretty much any American TV show that's ever needed that sort of landscape. And Vasquez Rocks, which have been used in so many TV shows, films and music videos that there is a separate Wikipedia page just listing them, is conveniently twenty-nine miles from the centre of the zone. If those rocks were slightly further away from Hollywood, then who knows? Perhaps Bill and Ted would have been killed by their evil robot doubles somewhere else. Why thirty miles? Union rules. Hollywood is a union town, and long ago, it was negotiated that thirty miles was ""local"" and anything outside wasn't, presumably after many, many disagreements going back and forth between union reps and the studios. Now, exceptions have been added over time: the rules are complicated, and I couldn't explain them all if I tried. Production coordinators generally have that job. But in summary: this thirty-mile zone, this TMZ, and yes, that's where the gossip site got its name from, this border is why, sometimes, it looks like the crew of the Enterprise are boldly going where quite a lot of people have gone before."
78,Voyager 1's Getting Closer to Earth Right Now,"The Voyager 1 space probe is the furthest man-made object from Earth, and the fastest. But right now, it is moving towards us. Relatively speaking. This is the control room for NASAâs Deep Space Network and the scientists here still listen for the signals that Voyager is sending. Deep Space Network is a collection of antennas around the world that we use for tracking deep space missions. We provide commands to the spacecraft, so yâknow, âturn left at the next cornerâ kinds of things, right? Little more complicated than that. Turn the instrument on, turn the instrument off, software updates. The most important reason for sending the thing out there is to get the science data back, and so the instruments are taking visible pictures, infrared pictures, measuring particles in the case of Voyager. We need to get that data back down and distribute it to the scientists. The Deep Space Networkâs three stations cover the whole sky. Any mission more than 30,000 km away from Earth is visible to at least one station all the time. Geostationary orbit, where we keep most of our communication satellites, is further away than that. We really have three complexes around the world: Madrid in Spain, Goldstone here in California, and the Canberra complex in Australia. We typically donât track things that go over the pole because the types of missions that we deal with are in deep space and tend to be in the ecliptic. If you look at the solar system, where the Sun is, and where the planets are that are revolving around the sun, they all tend to be more or less in one plane. That launch along the plane of the solar system, along the ecliptic, is the reason that Voyager is getting closer to Earth right now. Yes, Voyager is always moving away from the sun, but sometimes the Earthâs orbit means that our planet is travelling in roughly the same direction only faster. So weâre catching up. Of course, weâll get pulled back in our elliptical orbit so itâll even out when we go back the other way. In terms of checking in with spacecraft, I think with Voyager for example, we probably downlink from them almost every day. Because again, thereâs a lot of good data, but when you are only coming at 160 bits per second, it takes a long time to get that data off the spacecraft. The signal has to be, in some sense, above the noise level for us to see it. You first of all just try to filter the noise out as much as possible, just from a frequency standpoint. My signal occupies this much spectrum in frequency, I donât want to let in any more noise than whatâs there. I want to correlate the signal thatâs coming down with what I think that signal looks like. You got to take advantage of what you know about the signal and use those characteristics as best you can to extract it from the noise. Voyager 1 is carrying radioisotope thermoelectric generators, RTGs. Itâs powered by radioactive decay. And thereâs enough power there to last until around 2025. After that, the craft will go dark, carrying a message forward into interstellar space forâ¦ well, we donât know where, or when, or even who. If there was enough light being bounced off of it, you might be able to see it with a telescope, but itâs so far away, and so dim, without a radio signal coming from Voyager at all, thereâs no way that we, the DSN, would be tracking it. And so I think thatâs pretty much the end, once it goes dark. Thank you very much to all the team at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and here at the Deep Space Network. Pull down the description for more about them, and about their missions."
79,Why This âZero Calorie Sweetenerâ Isnât Zero Calories,"Last time I did a run of guest videos, we had an enthusiastic young presenter talking about food science and backing it up with an experiment. Well, we are doing it again! Alex, from Technicality Studios, itâs all yours. This is Splenda. Itâs known as a zero-calorie sweetener or a healthy replacement for sugar. âSplenda no calorie sweetener, with the original sugar-like taste you love and trust.â Hold up. Wait a minute. How is this even possible? Have you ever thought to yourself itâs a little strange that a food has zero calories? Can any even have that? Well, yes. Itâs theoretically possible. Think of it this way. If you, say, eat plastic, nothing really will happen. Plastic has zero usable calories. If you eat it, you canât take energy from it. Donât eat plastic, by the way. This is just an example. So, before answering how many calories Splenda really has, if any, we first have to answer if Splenda has any usable calories at all. How do we do that? Well, when we eat and digest sugar, or sucrose, our body turns it into glucose and fructose. Fructose is delivered to your liver and promptly turned into glucose, and glucose is the stuff your body uses as energy. To find out if thereâs any calories in this packet of Splenda, we have to find out if thereâs any glucose in this packet of Splenda and finding thatâs easy, or at least, it seemed easy after my chemistry teacher explained that to me like 20 times. Weâll do two experiments. For the first experiment, the control test, weâll dissolve 0.2 grams of sugar and 0.1 grams of an enzyme called invertase in water. Enzymes are things that speed up chemical reactions, or catalysts. Thus, the enzyme will quickly break down sugar into glucose and fructose. In the second experiment, weâll use the exact same procedure, but change one material. Instead of using sugar, weâll use Splenda. Letâs go to the lab. Now that weâve gathered all the materials, letâs get started. Note to future editing self: this is Splenda. This is sugar. So, now Iâm going to dissolve both of those things in water, in these things, test tubes. Now that weâve dissolved everything in the test tube, letâs put them in a warm water bath like this for 20 minutes. The water should be about 37 degrees Celsius or body temperature. This is the best temperature for the enzymes. After letting it sit for 20 minutes, Iâm going to put in Benedictâs solution. Benedictâs solution will tell us if thereâs glucose in these test tubes. Benedictâs solution is named after Stanley Rossiter Benedict, an American chemist, and not Benedict Cumberbatch, a British actor. This is a disappointment. Itâs now time to goggle up. Now, when we put in the Benedictâs solution, weâre going to replace the 37-degree water with boiling water. Then, letâs add in a few drops and wait for the Benedictâs solution to do its thing. So, we just learned that how Benedictâs solution works is basically itâs a spectrum, right? So, blue would be the least amount of glucose, no glucose. And then thereâs red, which would be the most amount of glucose, thatâs a lot of glucose. Now, as you can see, these two are basically kind of orangey-caramel coloured, but the one in the Splenda solution actually is a little darker and a little more intense, if you look really closely. So, that means thereâs actually more glucose in the Splenda than the actual sugar. Isnât that crazy? I mean, I was blown away. Splenda, which is marketed as a zero-calorie alternative to sugar, actually has more glucose than actual sugar. Why? Well Splendaâs most-used ingredient is dextrose. You know what that is? A fancy word for glucose. So, how many calories are in these packets? Four. Four calories. How do we know that? Well, I emailed Splenda Customer Service. And they wrote back that there are four calories in each single serve packet of Splenda no calorie sweetener because that makes sense. Side note here, one gram of sugar has four calories and each packet of Splenda is about a gram. But wait a sec. If each packet has four calories, why is Splenda allowed to say they have none? That seems pretty sketchy. It might seem sketchy, but itâs completely legal. The Food and Drug Administration allows foods with fewer than five calories per serving to be marketed as having zero calories down to the nutrition label. That means you canât trust any food that claims it has zero calories. Well, now you know. Until next time, thank you so very much for watching. Thank you to Tom for giving me the privilege of making a guest video. Thank you to my chemistry teacher for staying late and helping me with every little annoying thing I asked for. DFTBA, and explore on! Go subscribe to Alexâs channel! Letâs be honest, heâs going to have my job in a few years, so youâre just getting in early. That is it for this run of guest videos. Thank you very much for watching. Thank you to all the presenters. Iâll be back next time and, until then, I will see you on the Internet!"
80,Why Song Translations Usually Suck,"Todayâs guest video is a little different from normal, so be prepared for music, emoji and being told youâre hot, as Alex from Play the Mind takes on song translations. Alex, take it away. â« Give your heart and soul to me â« and life will always be â« La Vie En Rose. â« You just heard a contrafactum. Thatâs when the lyrics of the song are changed, but the music stays the same. Parody songs are a good example of contrafactum and so are song translations. But as opposed to parodies, song translations give the false impression of remaining faithful to the original. For instance, what I just sang is part of the English version of the French song La Vie En Rose by Edith Piaf. The French lyrics of what I sang are, ""Et dÃ¨s que je l'aperÃ§ois alors je sens en moi, mon cÅur qui bat."" The meaning of these words has nothing to do with what I just sang. As a matter of fact, the whole English version ends up becoming short, bilingual, gender-neutral and sung directly to the loved one, which are characteristics not present in the original French version. And this song isnât the only case where this happens. When dealing with any song translation, thereâs a conflict between the meaning of the lyrics and the way they sound when spoken. If you were to translate a song purely based on meaning, you would end up having lyrics with beats following on syllables, which naturally don't RE-ceive an ac-CENT when spo-KEN. So, somewhere, you need to sacrifice some meaning in order to preserve good sound. And whoâs to blame for making song translations so darn complicated? Itâs phonology. The phonology of a language is like its musical DNA and it has a primordial influence on how the melody of a song gets written in a certain language. Even the particular way a baby cries has to do with how its mother speaks. There are two things to consider in phonology. The phonemes are the vowels and consonants that make up speech and the prosody of a language is the way the phonemes are put together into syllables, words and sentences and their intonation in order to convey meaning. Itâs the prosody of English that makes the difference between saying, âHey, youâre HOT,â and saying, âHey. YOUâRE hot.â But, back to music. Itâs the phonological system of a language which shapes the melody of a song originally written in that language. And when translating that song into a language with a completely different phonological system, something ends up sounding bad. For instance, some languages, like Hindi or Italian, are more favourable to melismatic singing, where you have multiple notes sung over just a few vowels. Hereâs an example in English: â« If I... â« should stay... â« That was Whitney Houston. And other languages, such as German or Polish, are more favourable to syllabic singing, where you have one note per syllable. â« Freude schÃ¶ner GÃ¶tterfunken â« Tochter aus Elysium! â« That was Ludwig Van. Gesundheit! Therein lies the crux of the matter. Setting the text of a syllabic language to a melismatic song or vice-versa, sounds forced, artificial. Iâm fully aware that no language is purely syllabic or purely melismatic, but I am emphasising these extremes in order to drive my point home. A song translation can either sound good, but be inaccurate in meaning, or it can be accurate, but sound bad. Take your pick. But, how important are song translations nowadays? Well, think of this. Roughly 80 million people speak Korean worldwide, yet to this day, the video on YouTube with most views is the Korean song âGangnam Styleâ with more than 2.5 billion views. This means most of the audience probably didnât understand a word that was being sung. Go subscribe to Play the Mind for all sorts of videos about music theory and acoustics, including one about the very first mic drop. Next time, in the last guest video of the run, we have something in the ever-popular genre of ""that thing youâre eating isnât what you think it is"". See you then."
81,The Foil That Went To The Moon And Back,"Todayâs guest video is from Amy at Vintage Space, who has brought along one of the greatest and also the tiniest props that I have ever seen Amy, itâs all yours. One of the benefits to being a professional space history nerd is you get to add some amazing artefacts to your private collection. My latest addition is this tiny piece of Kapton foil from Apollo 11. This tiny piece of foil went to the moon and came back through the earthâs atmosphere to be put on to this piece of paper, so I can hang it on my wall. But if you look closely at the piece, youâll notice that itâs sort of silvery and it looks like itâs been scratched off and thereâs gold underneath. So, whatâs going on with this piece of foil? What exactly was that silvery stuff? And the larger question is, why does the Apollo spacecraft look white when it launches, silver when itâs around the moon, and a dirty gold once itâs come back to earth? Well, itâs all part of the thermal protection system. Thermal protection was a huge engineering challenge for the men and woman who designed and built the Apollo spacecraft. Not only was the vehicle going to be flying through the vacuum of space where it would be exposed to raw, unfiltered sunlight and also in the shadow behind the moon, where there would be no light hitting it at all: it also had to return through the earthâs atmosphere at lunar re-entry speeds. This is an insanely fast re-entry through the earthâs atmosphere. In the case of Apollo, this re-entry speed was 24,677 miles per hour or 36,194 feet per second. That translated to a heat during re-entry of over 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That meant the Apollo spacecraft was going to need a very specific thermal protection system to not only get the spacecraft through the earthâs atmosphere in one piece, but to protect the three astronauts inside it. The thermal protection system actually involved a number of different elements. First was the boost protective cover. This is the white covering that fits over the command module that you see as being white when the spacecraft has made it to its launch vehicle on the launch pad, ready to go to the moon. This protected the spacecraft from the heat associated with launching through the atmosphere, but it didnât last very long. The boost protective cover was separated from the spacecraft when the launch escape tower jettisoned 200 seconds after launch. Once the boost protective cover was clear, the spacecraft looked silver. Thatâs because the entire Apollo command module was covered with a pressure sensitive Kapton polyimide tape. This tape was made of coded aluminium and oxidized silicon monoxide. The tape was applied to the entire external structure of the command module with the gold side down and the silver side facing out. Thatâs why, when you see pictures of the Apollo spacecraft in orbit around the moon, it looks like itâs reflecting space in a mirror. Itâs beautiful. Now, when it came time for the Apollo spacecraft to re-enter the atmosphere, this Kapton tape wasnât exactly enough to protect it from the searing heats of re-entry and it wasnât designed to. The Apollo spacecraft, like the Mercury and Gemini vehicles before it, was a blunt body design. It had a rounded bottom and a conical after body, designed to minimize convective heating during re-entry. The centre of gravity in the vehicle was also offset from the axis of symmetry in order to generate a very small amount of lift. This meant that the spacecraft had a little bit of controllability during re-entry. So, the blunt underside of the spacecraft was taking the brunt of the heat and that was where the last piece of the thermal protective system was housed. That of course is the ablative heat shield. The heat shield was a honeycomb structure bonded to the stainless-steel body of the spacecraft and each little honeycomb was individually filled with an ablative material that would burn away as it was heated thus protecting the spacecraft from the worst of heat of re-entry. But, the heat shield and the bow shock generated by that blunt body of re-entry couldnât entirely protect the outer structure of the spacecraft. As it went through that fireball phase of re-entry the Kapton was burned away a little bit, revealing the golden underside of the tape. But how is it that Iâm able to actually own a piece of the Apollo 11 spacecraft? Well, it turns out that recovery crews and pretty much anybody who could get within armâs reach of the spacecraft, and this doesnât just go for Apollo 11, this applies to all the vehicles that went to the moon, they would reach up and just take off a tiny piece of that foil as a souvenir. So, even if at first glance it looks like a tiny insignificant dime-sized portion of foil, itâs actually amazing to think that that little dime-sized piece of foil helped to protect the Apollo 11 astronauts on the way to the moon and their re-entry back through the earthâs atmosphere.

82,The Disaster That Changed Engineering: The Hyatt Regency Collapse,"Todayâs guest video is from Grady at Practical Engineering. Heâs talking about a tragedy: and the lessons we learned and the reasons why it happened are fascinating. Also, he made his own props. Grady, take it away. In the summer of 1981, the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, hosted a large party in the multi-story atrium area. During the event, suspended walkways on the second and fourth floors collapsed, killing over 100 people and injuring over 200 more. At the time, the accident was the worst structural failure in US history. In the wake of the disaster, investigators discovered a change to the original design of the walkways that was proposed by the fabricator and mistakenly approved by the structural engineer. What, at first glance, seemed like a subtle adjustment to the design, turned out to be the root cause of the failure. Two suspended walkways spanned the atrium in the Hyatt Regency with the second-floor walkway directly below the fourth-floor walkway. Each was supported by a series of box girders suspended by hanger rods and retained by nuts and washers. The original design called for a single pair of hanger rods, which would pass through each fourth-floor girder to the second-floor girder below. The fabricator responsible for constructing the walkways objected to this plan because it would require screw threads for the entire length of the hanger rods, which could easily be damaged during construction. So, they proposed to split the hanger rods into two sets. One to connect the fourth-floor walkway to the roof and one to connect the second-floor walkway up to the fourth-floor girders. If you donât notice the significance of this change, youâre not alone. It was approved by the engineer without a detailed review or calculations, which would have revealed its inherent flaw. In this setup, which represents the original design, the load of the two walkways is independently transferred to the hanger rods. Notice how I can lift each girder without affecting the other. Now, letâs look at the design change. In this configuration, notice that the entire weight of the second-floor walkway is being borne not directly by the hanger rod, but instead, by the girder above. If I lift the fourth-floor walkway, the second-floor walkway is lifted as well. The hanger rods are still carrying the same load at the top, but the two nuts on the upper girder are supporting the weight of both walkways. This simple change effectively doubled the load on those bolted connections. Imagine that you and a friend are both hanging on a rope. The original design is the equivalent of you both holding onto the rope independently, whereas the design change is the equivalent of your friend hanging onto your ankles. The total weight supported by the rope is the same in both cases, but your likelihood of maintaining a grip is not. This subtle change was identified by investigators as the primary cause of failure. With so many people on the walkways that evening, the load on the connections was too great. The box girders split open, slipping past the washers and nuts leading to the collapse of both walkways. There is an implicit handshake between a society and its engineers. We hardly have a choice but to trust that the constructed environment that we live in is safe and sound. When an engineer seals a design, he or she takes responsibility for its accuracy and safety to the general public. But the err is human and that includes engineers. So, we try to develop conventions and processes that can catch and correct from mistakes before they get too far. And that includes studying and learning from errors made in the past. The failure of the Hyatt Regency walkways is an important case study taught to nearly every engineer with the goal that such a tragedy will never occur again. Practical Engineering is filled with great videos, so go subscribe! I would recommend starting with Gradyâs video on hydrostatics. Next time, a guest video with a prop that has been to the moon."
83,You Can Hear The Difference Between Hot and Cold Water,"I am taking this month off, and while I'm gone, five other YouTube creators have lined up some brilliant guest videos for you. We start with science presenter, Steve Mould. And when he told me the title of this video I thought, âNo, I can't.â And then I was wrong. So: be nice, be kind; Steve, take it away! You have a super power that youâre probably not aware of, the ability to hear temperature, or at least, the ability to discern between hot and cold water just using your sense of hearing and this is something we can test. So, Iâm going to pour hot and cold water from these identical jugs into these identical mugs and itâs your job to figure out which is which. And Iâm going to blur the screen as well because there may be some visual cues that would tip you off, one way or the other. Okay, here we go. It should have been quite easy to tell which was which. Feel free to pause the video and leave a comment with your guess, if you like, but hereâs the answer: the first pour was cold and the second pour was hot. And the reason they sound different is because of the fact that the water is viscous -or thick, if you like, and the viscosity of water goes down when you heat it. This is something thatâs easier to see with a liquid like honey. So, warm honey is more runny than cold honey, whereas, with water, itâs less visually apparent. But when you pour water, the way it splashes into a cup is affected by the viscosity. And this change in the splashing of the water changes the sound that it makes because of various complex fluid dynamic reasons. Whatâs really interesting is this is knowledge you already had due to a lifetime of hearing cold drinks and hot drinks being made. And like many things, this is something that you knew intuitively, even though it wasnât something you were aware of consciously. Go subscribe to Steve Mouldâs channel! I would recommend his video on a self-pouring liquid as being a good place to start. Next time, the tale of an engineering disaster."
84,"One Town, Four Elements: Ytterby","In 1792, a chemist named Gadolin received a sample of a mysterious black rock from this now-closed Swedish mine. It was far too heavy to be coal: it was called ytterbite, after Ytterby, the nearby town. Nowadays, we understand the basics of chemistry. We've named all the natural elements and we've made our own. But back then, it wasn't just that there were gaps in the periodic table, it's that there wasn't a periodic table at all. Heck, when Gadolin was given the rock from this mine, Lavoisier, known as the father of chemistry, had only just published the paper setting forward the theory of elements: and even he speculated that those elements might include light and ""caloric"", an invisible fluid that explained how heat worked. It was plausible at the time. The way to work out whether something was a new element was basically: do stuff to it and see what happened. Which is still the technique today, it's just that ""do stuff to it"" is now defined as ""smash atoms together in a particle accelerator and track the bits of radiation given out as the results decay"". For centuries, though, it was things like ""heat stuff up and see what wavelengths of light come out"" or ""put different voltages of electricity through it and see how the current changes"". The big problem was that the samples that those chemists were working with weren't anything close to pure, and they couldn't know how to purify something that hadn't been discovered yet. So they had to work out: was that a new element that they were looking at, or just a combination of known ones? So papers were published that turned out later to be completely wrong, and were corrected by others: which is great, because that's how science works, but it also means that a lot of people and places that might have had elements named after them were disappointed. Canada, Norway, Russia, unlucky. Here, though? Ah, there were discoveries to be made. Through the 19th century, Gadolin and other chemists found that the black rocks from this mine had not one, but four new elements that were completely unknown to science. And they were all named after here: yttrium, terbium, erbium, and ytterbium, making this small town in Sweden the only place in the world with four elements named after it."
85,The World Is Slowly Running Out Of Sand,"I'm in Cape May, at the southern tip of New Jersey, where the US Army Corps of Engineers have just finished rebuilding this beach. A dredge is going offshore, and it's like a vacuum, and it's sucking a sand-and-water mix up into the dredge. Then it travels back toward the shore and pumps that sand-and-water mix onto the beach. And then bulldozers and construction equipment will shape that beach and build that template, that's designed to reduce the damages from storms. We're using multiple hopper dredges and miles of pipe, we're using construction equipment, bulldozers, and excavators, all to complete this job. We are demobilising from the site, so all this equipment is going to another section in Cape May, and we'll begin dredging and beachfill operations at that location. Miami Beach in America, the Gold Coast in Australia, the beaches of Dubai: around the world, engineers dredge sand from offshore and pump it back onto beaches. Not only because the tourists demand it, but more importantly because those beaches protect the folks living next door from the ocean. And as sea levels rise, beach erosion is happening faster and faster. Well, in New Jersey, there's lots of infrastructure that's at risk from storms. Boardwalks, utilities, roads, homes, businesses. And so this process is the best means we have to reduce storm damages in a cost-effective and an environmentally acceptable way. But there are other uses for sand, too: every concrete building in the world, every skyscraper, is basically just a load of sand, like this, stuck together with cement. And the world is running out of it. I know, that sounds strange, but the construction industry uses billions of tons of sand every year. So the obvious answer would seem to be: use sand from elsewhere, right? We've got whole deserts and ocean floors full of the stuff. But those sands aren't useful. Desert and sea sands are too fine, too smooth, they don't stick together properly, either for making concrete or for rebuilding a beach like this. It has to be this kind of sand: sand that's been created by moving water and waves over aeons. This is not a renewable resource, not on any human timescale. And if it's not there to protect the coast: then the folks who live nearby should start getting worried. This project was first completed in 1990, and we've come back numerous times over the years to renourish and pump additional sand onto the beach. If we didn't pump this sand into this area and built an engineered system, the communities would be at higher risk of damages from hurricanes, nor'easters, and other storm events. Now, running out of sand doesn't mean that we're suddenly going to be unable to build anything. It just means that as supply goes down, the price of construction will go up... and there are going to be some rough market forces. No-one's considering stripmining the Jersey shore any time soon, but journalist Vince Beiser spent years investigating illegal sand mining in the developing world, and brought back reports of disappearing islands, devastated ecosystems and murderous black-market sand mafias. Hundreds of people have been killed over sand. Now, here, the Corps of Engineers are keeping a community safe, some birds safe, and making sure there'll still be a beach here for tourists this summer. But in a hundred years, who knows? Maybe New Jersey will get a better offer for this sand."
86,á¼á: Harald Bluetooth and Your Phone,"I'm in the small village of Jelling, in Denmark. And behind me, in that central churchyard, are the Jelling Stones. They're runestones, historical markers placed there by some of the first kings of Denmark more than a thousand years ago. Once they were painted bright colours, but a millennium of erosion has taken its toll. That's also why they're now in a climate-controlled glass box to keep them safe from the weather and from vandals. The smaller, older stone was placed by King Gorm in honour of his wife, Thyra, but the larger one: that was placed by their son, whose name, once you translate it to English, was Harald Bluetooth. The inscription honours his parents, and then it says: ""Harald, who won for himself all of Denmark and Norway and made the Danes Christian"". There's an inscription of Jesus on the back. Now, obviously, history is messy and complicated, and if you are raising a memorial runestone to yourself and to your own achievements, then you gloss over some of the less successful bits of your history, but still: this is an incredibly important artifact. It's called Denmark's birth certificate, it's part of this World Heritage Site, and it tells the tale of a king who united Denmark and Norway. A thousand years later, an engineer at Intel called Jim Kardach was working on short-range radio technology, the sort of thing that might unite computers and cell phones, and make all those devices speak one compatible protocol. The various names proposed for the various technologies were things like Biz-RF, MC-Link and Low Power RF, which were all a bit unwieldy. Kardack heard the story of Harald Bluetooth from a Swedish person that he was working alongside, and he figured, huh, that'd make a good codename for the technology. And that's all it was. A codename. The official name that was decided later was Personal Area Networking, or PAN, a name that stuck until three weeks before launch when the lawyers said that they couldn't possibly trademark something so generic. With no other options, they went with Bluetooth. And that logo? Harald Bluetooth. HB in the runes of the time, more or less. Combine those two characters into what's called a ""bind rune"", sort of kind of like a signature... and there's the Bluetooth logo. A thousand years ago, a Danish king stood somewhere near here and ordered those stones to be carved and raised. And now, his name is on our phones."
87,The Little-Known Patterns on British Streets,"All around Britain, you will find this: tactile paving. Itâs to help blind and partially sighted people find their way around. And here is the clever part, and the part that almost everyone who is fully sighted will never have noticed: there are different patterns for different situations. Very few people see nothing at all. Thatâs important to say. Only about 3%. Some people have light perception, some people have a bit more vision. Some people have a limited field of vision. Some people have poor central vision but good peripheral vision. Essentially, you think of partially sighted people with enough vision to be able to get around safely and independently, blind being below that threshold. Dots in a grid, like this, mean a dropped kerb for crossing the road. If itâs red, or at least, if itâs supposed to be red, itâs a crossing with lights or something else to stop traffic: these designs are for partially sighted people too, so bright contrasting colours are a good idea. There is a small amount of tactile paving here, used as a marker, to flag up where the crossing is. And then near the road, itâs for the full length of the crossing, so you can work out where it is. And itâs important to balance marking the crossing against not using too much tactile paving: because someone with arthritis can find surfaces like this painful to cross. Navigating around an unfamiliar area is always a bit scary, to be honest. Because, obviously, traditional visual clues, landmarks etc, aren't there. It helps a lot if clues are consistent, so confusion can certainly occur when that isnât the case. Itâs very, very important that these adaptations that are there to help us are actually there to help us and are actually there in the way that we expect to see them. But there are other patterns too. Offset dots mean thereâs a train platform ahead, a big chasm you could fall into. Lozenge shapes mean a tram platform, something closer to street level that could run you over. Stripes across the path mean thereâs some steps ahead, or a couple of other things that could trip you up. Stripes along the path mean a safe route to follow. And if thereâs a path thatâs half for foot traffic, and half for bicycles? Well, the direction of the stripes tells you which side is which. Boroughs in London, councils outside of London, seem to be moving more towards aesthetic considerations, i.e. theyâre changing the colour to darker greys so it blends in more. By definition if it blends in more, itâs harder for partially sighted people such as myself to actually see. Or obviously, in a more dire situation, people can find themselves in the road, not knowing theyâre in the road, simply because those essential clues arenât there. And sure, all this is tricky to get right. The design standards for how this is laid down are literally a hundred pages long. But so are the design standards for everything about public infrastructure: having reliable rules that everyone understands is important when there are tons of metal speeding past you. Thank you very much to the team from the Royal National Institute of Blind People for all their help! You can check out their YouTube channel here, and yes, I have linked the full hundred-page design document in the description!"
88,Fallout Shelters and Zurich's Water: Swiss Resilience,"Swiss engineering has a reputation for being precise and reliable. And the country has a reputation for being... not paranoid, exactly, but at least taking a lot of precautions about their safety. Switzerland is the only country in the world with enough nuclear fallout shelters for the entire population. Even now, it's a legal requirement that any new build house here must have a shelter if it's not close enough to an existing one. And okay, a lot of those shelters are being used mostly for storage these days, probably for cheese, but if the world takes a dark path? Switzerland is ready. And that extends to this. The drinking water. I'm in Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, and it has an entire backup water supply system. The city has hundreds of drinking fountains, free for public use, of all sorts of designs. And okay, most of them are fed from the same pipes as homes and offices: it's mostly filtered water from nearby Lake Zurich, with a bit of spring water and ground water mixed in. It is, of course, some of the safest drinking water in the world. Because Switzerland. But in the event of an emergency: let's say the lake was contaminated somehow, or there's a days-long power cut that shuts all the pumps down: not that that's likely, because the electricity supply is just as secure, but if it happens: Zurich is still prepared. There is an entire backup water system, fed by nothing more than gravity from a spring on a nearby mountain. It runs through 150 kilometres of pipes to taps in hospitals and fallout shelters, and special drinking fountains like this. These can all be adapted so they can fill a lot of buckets in a very short amount of time with nothing more than some hoses and scaffolding. This water isn't being wasted, by the way. I mean, it is, no-one's drinking it, but if it wasn't going through these pipes it'd just be joining a river and heading straight to the ocean by a different path. Lots of cities maintain some level of redundant water supply: some backup pipes, or emergency tankers in case everything fails. But Zurich? They have two systems, constantly tested, always running together. Just in case the world ends."
89,Why YouTube Streams Don't Count For Christmas â 1,"The battle for Christmas number one is a British music tradition. To be at the top of the charts on Christmas Day is to have a place in history. Sometimes, serious pop acts have managed it: the Spice Girls did it three times in a row. Sometimes, it was more of a mid-90s fever dream. âª âBlobby, oh Mr Blobbyâ¦â âª Some of the importance of the Christmas Number One comes from the UK music industryâs official charts, which are based purely on music sales, not on airplay. Every pop music radio station in Britain could play a track every hour, on the hourâ¦ and it wouldnât make a bit of difference if no one walked into a music shop, opened their wallets, and actually bought the physical single â or, later, paid to download a digital file. That doesnât really work these days. If you go back to 1952, when the charts were first launched, a guy called Percy Dickens basically just used to get on the phone and call up 20 of his mates who worked in record shops and just ask them, what records were popular that particular week? And it was as basic as that. So for most of the history of the charts, what we've done is we've counted sales, because that's the way that consumers music fans have been able to access their music. Every year, hundreds of music acts release novelty Christmas singles, hoping to be the one that makes it through the dreck and gets to the top of the charts. And almost all of them fail, although itâs pretty heartwarming when they do succeedâ¦ because it usually means that the winner of the X Factor has been beaten down into second place, and people seem to enjoy it when Simon Cowell doesnât win. But calculating the numbers now is trickier than it used to be. For the last 2Â½ years, we've been not just counting sales, but also adding streams in there as well. We convert the streams to sales by dividing the streams by 100, and then we put it all together. The 100 is essentially an estimate of the value of a stream versus the value of a download. We're actually changing that from the beginning of 2017, to 150, because what we're seeing is a massive shift in terms of the number of streams that are being generated and the number of sales that are being made as well. Spotify, and Apple Music. Deezer, and Tidal. Amazon have both Amazon Prime Music and Amazon Unlimited. We count those as well. There are other, smaller services on top of that. But pretty much any audio streaming service you'll be using, we count. Youâll notice something missing from that list of streaming services: the official UK chart doesnât count YouTube views. In theory, YouTube could track music use: but it canât tell whether youâre listening to a song because youâre there to listen to musicâ¦ or just because someoneâs decided to soundtrack their multi-million-view video with Bing Crosbyâs White Christmas. We've never counted video, and consumption of video, and we're not doing so now. That said, obviously we're always talking about it, it's a big debate within the industry, about whether it should or it shouldn't count. That may change at some point in the future, but not quite for now. I donât know whoâs going to be Christmas number one this year. And neither do the folks here, at the official UK charts company, at least as I record this, although I suspect probably theyâve got a pretty good idea by now. At 5:40pm on December 23rd, BBC Radio 1 will make the announcement, and â at least for this year â someone will still be entering the history books."
90,"In Old Movies, Why The Dial Tone After Someone Hangs Up?","Brace yourselves, we're about to get into some serious detail about telephone systems. I'm at the Museum of Communications in Seattle, to answer a question: in old Hollywood films, when someone is on a phone call and they got hung up on, why did they hear a dial tone? [dial tone] ""Well, you can stick your well-laid plan up your well-laid ass."" [dial tone] Supervision is the word that describes how a telephone switch knows whether the calling and called parties are on hook or off hook. When you end a call and hang up, the equipment receives that on-hook signal, and anything that was in service at that time disconnects and goes back to its normal state. So you end up with dead air. Now, the reason that a sound director would use a dial tone instead of just nothing is kind of obvious, right? It's to make it clear that the other side has hung up. That's certainly what lots of people argue online. Except they could just do that by using one short sound effect. And sometimes, they do. ""Don't ever call me again."" [rattling click] ""Wow! I... I guess you're home."" ""Good luck."" [rattling click] It turns out there's another reason. Back in the days of celluloid film, southern California was one of the few places in America with independent telephone companies, not part of the giant Bell monopoly that handled the rest of the country. Well, behind us is a step-by-step system and it's a relative of the telephone systems that were used in most of southern California. The Bell system didn't have as much of a monopoly there. As I dial a number, various elements of the step connect me through the system from start to finish. And that's where it got the name step-by-step. As I finish dialling, the call will connect... [ringing] ...and it can be answered. Now, in the step system, it doesn't have what's called 'far-end supervision'. And that means that the called party can hang up and pick up again as many times as they want, and the call won't disconnect. But if the calling party hangs up... [dial tone] ...the called party will get hit with dial tone right away because the system doesn't know whether I've been hung up on or whether I've just picked up the phone. So in Hollywood, where all of the movies were being written and filmed, their experience on the telephone was actually different from most of the rest of America, and the world. Which, let's be honest, is kind of like so many other things in Hollywood. The bottom line is: the folks making the movies really did get a dial tone when they were hung up on, at least sometimes, so they put that in their films. Or they picked whichever option worked best for the scene. If it's still happening when a character uses a cell phone, though? That's just lazy. Thank you to all the team at Seattle's wonderful Museum of Communications! You can check out their YouTube channel over here or pull down the description for a link to the Museum and to see their opening hours and a list of all the incredible equipment they've got here."
91,"Wheels, Bombs, and Perpetual Motion Machines","Perpetual motion machines are badly named. A true perpetual motion machine doesnât just keep spinning forever: if you were to set an object spinning out in intergalactic space, in some ideal true vacuum, it would keep spinning forever. You just wouldnât be able to get any useful work out of it. If someone actually built a perpetual motion machine, a true one, it would give out more energy than is put in: enough to overcome friction, enough to overcome air resistance, enough to keep going until mechanical failure. And like a wind turbine, itâd let you take some of that extra energy for your own use. There are, obviously, some physics objections to this. The laws of thermodynamics always hold true. This here is a device made by Thomas Young in 1807. It is the original, two centuries old from the archives of the Royal Institution in London, which is why I have to wear gloves to touch it. Itâs an unbalanced wheel, and there have been many perpetual motion machines like it. There was a giant one in Los Angeles in the early 20th century, advertising a cafÃ©: and according to Popular Mechanics, it kept going until there was a city-wide power cut. And there was an inventor in 1829 who was sure that a carriage with conical wheels would roll around the world ââtill time shall be no moreâ. They all work on the same principle: cheat the centre of gravity so itâs always on one side, constantly unbalanced in the same direction. In this case, if you draw a line down the middle, there are more ball bearings on one side, so that side should be heavier, and when one gets near the top... ...it rolls over, so that side over there is constantly being pushed down. This doesnât work, obviously. And thatâs why Thomas Young built this machine: to demonstrate that itâs impossible. There may be more ball bearings on that side, but the ones on this side are further away from the centre. No matter how much you complicate it, this wheel will just rock back and forth and eventually settle where the centre of gravity is lowest, or where friction stops it. But imagine if perpetual motion machines did work. Which isnât difficult to imagine, apparently: there are all sorts of snake-oil companies who successfully sucker investors into giving up surprising amounts of money, and then never produce any actual proof of a working prototype. There have been so many attempts that both the US patent office and the UK ""pay-tent"" office refuse to even entertain the idea of perpetual motion machines. Now, you can argue physics and thermodynamics all you want, but thereâs a more common-sense argument against perpetual motion machines, against the idea of free energy. Because regardless of how itâs powered, whether itâs an unbalanced wheel or something else, if you have a magic box that can give out more energy than it takes in: what happens if you use a small one to power a bigger one, and so on, and so on, and so on? You could start with something the size of a grain of sand, and rotate the Earth with it. Or what happens if you plug it into itself? If you have something that multiplies the energy you put in... then after a few seconds, youâve got a bomb. Thank you very much to the Royal Institution! Over on their channel Iâm debunking three other types of perpetual motion machines along with someone from their team. Go check it out!"
92,"The City of the Dead: Colma, California","There aren't many graveyards in San Francisco. Two, actually: a small one at Mission Dolores Church, and a military one at the Presidio. San Francisco land is too expensive to be given to the dead, and it has been for a long time: in the first decades of the 20th century, all the 150,000 bodies buried in San Francisco were moved. To one town. Here. Welcome to Colma, just a few miles south of San Francisco: a town known as the City of Souls. Colma is only a small place, but about three-quarters of it is made up of cemeteries. About one and a half thousand people live here... along with about one and a half million who don't so much live here as just... rest. That means the dead outnumber the living by around a thousand to one. And many of those bodies were moved here from their first resting place, or their second, or their third. The trouble was that San Francisco ran out of room, and banned new burials. the dead don't pay rent, and their living relatives don't really want to either. With no new, er, customers arriving in San Francisco, the old graveyards there had no money for upkeep, and fell into ruin. There were reports of grave robbery, of valuables or -occasionally -of skeletons. So fourteen cemetery associations founded this town as a place for the dead. Many of those moved here were placed in mass graves, their tombstones sold to be used for construction material or dumped in the Bay as breakwaters. With no-one to pay for new funeral plots and more than a hundred thousand bodies to move, the folks doing the job took shortcuts. Sometimes, modern construction work in San Francisco will exhume dozens of bodies that the movers missed. So why go to the trouble of moving them at all, then? Well, it was either move the bodies immediately, or deal with them while you're digging foundations for new buildings anyway. What else were they going to do? Almost everyone has a fear and disgust response to death, for good reasons: and religion and tradition in America, then, dictated that the dead must be buried. The Catholic Church wouldn't allow cremation until decades later, and, well, there wasn't another option. And sure, the comments on this video will make all sorts of horror movie or zombie apocalypse jokes -and if you've already done that, congratulations, you're not original -but here's a different question: most people figure that cemetery plots are forever. If you choose to be buried, the spot where you're laid to rest is permanently yours, at least in some sense of yours. That's not true: already, some areas of Europe are re-using graves, and eventually every headstone's going to be weathered away. So here's my question: when does moving a body stop being disrespect for the dead and start being archaeology?"
93,The World's Most Famous Teapot: The Utah Teapot,"I'm at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, and amongst all the thousands of artifacts here is this: a regular, everyday teapot. The world's most famous teapot. It's called the Utah Teapot, and you've almost certainly seen it before, even if you don't realise it. Or at least, a digital version of it. In the old Windows Pipes screensaver, occasionally instead of a ball joint, a teapot would appear. This teapot. It's in the background of that 3D-animated Simpsons episode from the 90s, and it's in a couple of Pixar films. It's an in-joke amongst animators, and that's because it was the first realistic, complex object to be widely used in computer graphics. In 1974, a researcher at the University of Utah called Martin Newell needed a reference object, something simple to test the algorithms he was designing. The story goes that he told his wife this as they were sitting down for tea -Newell was born in Britain, so tea -and she suggested that modelling the teapot. And it was ideal. It has concave and convex surfaces. It can cast shadows on itself, which is a problem that some algorithms might find difficult to solve. It's immediately recognisable: you can tell by eye if the teapot looks like a teapot, or if something's gone wrong with your rendering. And you don't have to texture it to make it look good. As long as it has a plain, light colour, and it... well, it... it looks like a teapot. But it's also not too complicated: back in the seventies, computer graphics involved a lot of working by hand. Newell sketched the teapot on graph paper, and then typed in the resulting coordinates by hand. And here's what I really like about the teapot: over the forty-something years that the digital version of it has existed, details about it have been lost to history. It's said that it was used so much for early graphics experiments that some people could remember all of its data in their head and just type it in when they needed it. Can I find a reliable source for that? Absolutely not, but it's a great story. And at some point, the teapot got squished a bit: some people claim that it's because of old displays with non-square pixels, and some claim it's just because it looked better that way. This is a artifact of the digital era that's got urban legends around it. And whether they're true or not, there's now a canonical version of the teapot: a digital object that's been copied and copied and copied into all sorts of modern culture. Literally billions of people have seen -well, not this teapot -but a version of it that can be described in one page of numbers. Thanks very much to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California! Pull down the description for links to them and the amazing exhibits they've got here."
94,3D Printing Stainless Steel with Giant Robot Arms,"This is a teach pendant, and traditionally, itâs how you teach a robot arm to do something. Itâs awkward. Two of the problems with programming robots the traditional way are that you need to tell it exactly what you want it to do, point to point. The other is that the robot assumes that nothing changes. You just manually drive the tip of the robot to where you know you need it to go and then hit ârecord,â and remember that point, then you drive it over to the other place and hit ârecord,â and remember that point, and then, when you play, it goes from one point to the next. And it can do that over, and over, and over again. In the event that there is some error or something moves, the robot has no way of knowing that. The robot will still go exactly where you told it to go the first time, and that can result in a crash, or breaking something, or injuring a person. Itâs just like any computer. It will do exactly what you ask it to do, even if that's not what you meant! In the early days of computers, writing code generally meant using whatâs called 'assembly language'. You would have to literally tell the processor to move things from one memory address to another, or to tweak some values, or to change specific pixels on the screen. Like giving instructions to this arm, you would be telling the chip every single thing that it had to do. As time moved on, programmers got higher level languages. Write some words and some brackets, the system works out the boring details for you. If youâve ever worked with a spreadsheet, then that counts. Writing a formula in Excel, that's enough. In the end, sure, it all gets converted to assembly language. For most programmers, they never even have to think about it. The team here at Autodesk's Pier 9 in San Francisco are working on more or less the same thing, just for making physical things. Basically, the biggest robot that we have in the lab, which we call âAsh,â is essentially a big, robotic 3D printer that's printing in stainless steel. We have a MIG welder that is depositing stainless steel onto a metal plate. By activating the MIG welder while moving the robot, weâre building a weld bead, and then weâre building beads on top of each other. You would typically use welding to stitch two pieces of metal together. What weâre doing is using the same technology, but stacking the metal on top in order to produce a separate piece of finished material. Now, ultimately, the result is the same. The motors in the robot arm are told, âmove this way.â Itâs just that humanâs original instructions are a bit more abstract, and they're filtered through another couple of layers. Using a teach pendant would be pretty impractical for these complex curves. Normal 3D printers do basically 2Â½D. They go to an X and a Y, and then up and down. This robot can point in various directions. The robot needs to know not only where it is, but how it should point when it gets there. We give it a piece of geometry, and the software figures out the instructions set for the robot that will result in a print, that is what we want. One of the things weâre developing is a closed loop feedback system, where the robot is actually aware of what itâs doing. Before it completely fails a print, itâs keeping track of the quality of the print that itâs doing. It will actually correct, reprogram itself in real time, in order to avoid an actual failure. What weâre working on is a vision system, where between vision and a couple of other sensors, we can monitor and supervise the status of the prints. If the welder runs out of wire, or if something else happens, the robot would traditionally have no way of knowing. Now, the robot can know that. Not all the robotâs movements are being directly controlled by a person. If it goes wrong, itâs a bit different than just having an error message pop up. This arm here weighs two tonnes, and when it wants to, it moves fast. The only reason I'm allowed this close is because I'm literally holding the emergency stop button in my hand, just in case. Our robot currently has no way of sensing us. What currently happens is when a person that shouldnât be near a robot gets close to the robot, you shut everything down. It would be great, and weâre interested in a future where the robot can know that person is there, with vision or some other kinds of sensing, and then actively avoid that person, and continue doing what itâs doing. Self driving cars, hospital heart monitors, basically everything electronic: ultimately, the code in it is just 1s and 0s. The more levels of abstraction between the programmer and the bare metal, the easier it is to write code, but when something goes wrong, fixing it might be out of your hands. Thank you very much to all the team at Autodesk, and to their applied research lab, here at Pier 9 in San Francisco. Go and check out their YouTube channel, or pull down the description for some links to see the amazing projects they're working on."
95,The Spider Dress That Reacts To Personal Space Invaders,"In 1963, an anthropologist called Edward T. Hall realised there was no term for the study of personal space, so he invented one. Because that's the sort of thing that anthropologists like to do. He called it âproxemicsâ, and it caught on, because it turned out to be a good way to let people think about abstract questions like: how do you react when someone gets too close, too fast? What we have here is a robotic spider dress. So itâs a dress that has mechanical limbs that are reacting. It is reacting on you coming closer, so you coming near. There are two proximity sensors here. They are in the balls of the design. They are sensing when you come too close. There are 12 states that are pre-programmed. Basically, itâs deciding between 1 of those 12 states in order to create one of these animations. In his book, Hall proposes four distance zones: the public, the social, the personal and the intimate. Now, in the sort of life coaching seminars that people get sent to, and in middle management textbooks, those zones are treated as gospel, as 'this is how everyone behaves'. But in Hallâs own words, the zones were only a first approximation. They were based on a tiny sample of university educated Americans. They werenât representative of human behaviour in general, and they werenât meant to be. They were crude stereotypes. Actually, a lot of the book is crude stereotypes. Thereâs a whole section just titled âThe Frenchâ, which describes them as âsensually involved with each other.â I used 3D modelling in order to create this design. I'm using a software called âMayaâ, and then we 3D printed it out. It is 3D in nylon, in a technique called âselective laser sintering.â You can see here a lot of difficult geometries that are very thin at places, and they are very delicate. The technique of selective laser sintering means that you have basically a big box of powder, which is, in this case, nylon, and you have your laser beam. Itâs sintering out, itâs materialising exactly the model you created. Basically, when you take this design out, you're taking it from a big basket of powder, and all the powder is falling off. The proximity sensors are in this dress, so they're in the front of the dress and they are sensing in a beam that's being sent to the microcontroller which is in the back piece. As a scientific theory, the field of proxemics is vague. Hall just sort of thought it up and stated it in his book. There arenât many studies backed up with rigorous examination and statistics. Itâs mostly a set of observations and ideas. But despite what some hyper-rationalist people might think, those have value too. Being aware of the hidden rules that guide us, asking why we act the way we do: that can be a powerful tool for figuring out the way that the world works. And visualising something that isn't just invisible, but is actually an abstract concept? That can be a really powerful way to help understand yourself. Thanks to Anouk Wipprecht! Her dress is on display at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco until March 2017. Pull down the description for more links about her, the dress and the gallery."
96,The Grave of the Man Who Never Was: Operation Mincemeat,"It's not often that you see a gravestone with a correction on it. But then, it's not often that you find a story as strange as this one. I'm just outside Huelva, in southern Spain, and a little distance away is the grave of the Man Who Never Was. In 1943, as the Second World War raged on, the body of Major William Martin, of the British Royal Marines, was discovered floating off the coast here. Chained to him was a briefcase, and in it: a letter with details about the Allied armies' plans to attack Greece across the Mediterranean Sea. It wasn't 'here are all our secret war plans', but it was close; it was a friendly letter between generals that gave away all the necessary details. British Intelligence raced to recover the briefcase before German spies could look through it, but they were too late. Yes, Britain got its documents back: but not before a copy of them was on its way to Hitler, who then moved huge numbers of troops, tanks and boats to Greece, ready to repel the British attack. Hitler was probably quite surprised, then, when the Allies attacked Sicily, off the southern coast of Italy, and not Greece. And won, with a fraction of the losses that they could have suffered. There never was any Major William Martin. He was fictional. But there was a man called Glyndwr Michael. He was a Welshman in London in World War 2, homeless, penniless, friendless. He died on the streets after eating poison; perhaps deliberately, perhaps by desperately eating food that was left out for rats. We'll never know. According to official records, his body was ""removed out of England"", and well, that's true: his body was held in a mortuary for a while, then dressed in the correct uniform and given painstakingly forged personal documents: a receipt for a wedding ring, a photo and love letter from a fiancÃ©e, a bus ticket, some keys, some other paperwork. Then the body was put onboard a submarine which sailed to the coast of Spain. And quietly, on a dark night in April 1943, the boat's crew let the body drift with the currents. The plan was called, rather gruesomely, Operation Mincemeat. British Intelligence had chosen their target well. Spain had plenty of German spies, and the Spanish head of intelligence was the sort of man who would claim the discovery as his own, and then travel to Berlin to deliver copies personally, and perhaps even embellish the story of how it was found to make himself look better and the tip a bit seem more credible. Which he did. And of course, all the desperate British efforts to recover the documents were a sham. And by 1943, the team at Bletchley Park had cracked the Enigma cypher and were listening to German communications: less than a month after Glyndwr's body had been released, the codebreakers intercepted a signal that showed that the scheme had worked perfectly. Britain took Sicily, used it as a beachhead to get to Italy, and German war plans were in tatters. Major Martin, by then, had been buried with full military honours and an appropriate gravestone. The truth was still top secret. It wasn't until decades later that his real identity was revealed: and so the grave was corrected. Glyndwr Michael, served as Major William Martin. Rest in peace."
97,The Bizarre Plan to Drain the Mediterranean: Atlantropa,"I'm in Gibraltar, a bit of British territory on the south coast of Europe. Over there is Spain, and over there, visible on the horizon, is the north coast of Africa. In the 1920s, a German architect named Herman SÃ¶rgel saw an opportunity right here. He came up with a plan: to drain the Mediterranean Sea. It didn't seem entirely impossible. The Mediterranean naturally evaporates: more water comes in from the Atlantic than flows out, so if you actually managed to put a dam across the Straits of Gibraltar, the sea would slowly start to dry up. SÃ¶rgel said that, after the sea level had dropped maybe 100 or 200 metres, and a fifth of the water area had turned to land, Europe and Africa would be united into one continent, and there'd be huge amounts of new land for settlement and agriculture. And you could use the dam as a massive hydro power station, on a scale never considered before, letting just enough water through to meet the energy needs of all of his new continent. SÃ¶rgel made his plan public in the years after the First World War: perhaps, he thought, all that new land and exploration might be the solution to making sure there wasn't a Second. The project was called Atlantropa, and it is one of the most ambitious plans that has even been announced. It would have taken an effort on the scale of the Apollo moon shot. And it certainly got attention from the press and the public: but there were a few slight problems with it. First, there might not have been enough concrete in the world to build a dam that big, let alone all the other secondary dams and earthworks elsewhere needed to make the project work. And SÃ¶rgel didn't want the dam here, where the Strait of Gibraltar is narrowest, no, he wanted to build it about thirty kilometres that way, making it much, much longer. It'd have needed to be 300 metres high, and the foundations would be two and a half kilometres wide. But those are practicalities, right? Humanity could probably overcome that with enough effort and enough political will. Not that there would have been enough political will: the people on the Mediterranean coast would be, let's say, rather disappointed that they now lived inland, perhaps hundreds of miles from the sea. Venice and Genoa, the folks there, were particularly unhappy with that. The plan was popular in his native Germany but not particularly outside. And as for Africa: well, it was the early 20th century, their opinion apparently didn't matter. It wasn't so much a merging of Europe and Africa as an attempt at assimilation. But let's assume that, somehow, over decades, the Atlantropa project was built. There would have been some other problems. All that new land would be salt flats, completely unusable for growing crops or... well, for anything, really. And although SÃ¶rgel couldn't have known it at the time, some meteorologists now reckon that the project might have diverted the Gulf Stream, sending temperatures plunging in most of Europe and ending local agriculture as we knew it. And also, when SÃ¶rgel first came up with his grand plan, there likely wasn't a bomb in the world large enough to destroy a dam that big. Certainly not in one go, you could just about make it work... but that changed quite quickly during the Second World War. Having a single point of failure for millions of people's homes and lives is not ideal. SÃ¶rgel died in 1952, and any hope of the project died with him, after he'd spent a lifetime promoting it. But his idea lives on in science fiction, and as a testament, perhaps, not to how big we can actually build, but just how big we can dream."
98,The Solar Power Towers of Southern Spain,"These are the solar power towers of southern Spain. This is one of the sunniest parts of Europe, and these were two of the first solar towers ever built. Almost 2,000 heliostats, movable mirrors, constantly reflect the sun onto the towers, heating up water into steam, and powering a turbine to generate electricity. And if you look online, you'll see quite a few documentaries who've gotten a tour around there, who've been incredibly impressed by the technology, and who've been selling them as the future of power generation. And these are impressive. Not just visually, the technology behind them is both very clever and very simple: it's like bothering your teacher with the sunlight reflection off your phone, just on a much, much bigger scale. But there is a catch. When these were built, Spain was in boom times, and heavily subsidising solar power. Investors loved it and piled in with their own money, companies and researchers were happy to set up all sorts of things like this, and suddenly the Spanish government had many times the amount of solar power they'd planned for... and they had to subsidise all of it. And then the financial crash hit. The Spanish government cut subsidies. Not just for the future, not just for the plants that were under construction, but even for the plants that were already built and relying on those subsidies to balance the books. The industry got cold feet: Spain had altered the deal, and all the solar companies could do was pray they didn't alter it any further. Or go bankrupt, one of the two. This might still have been viable, maybe, with some more research and development, and that's what they were trying to do. But now, the cost of regular, everyday solar panels is tumbling. Not mirrors, not like this, just normal solar panels, the sort that you can fit to your house or that get put out in massive fields as solar farms, converting sunlight directly to electricity. Whether the price of those panels is going to keep falling depends on which team of researchers you believe, but it's already cheaper than building a giant tower, putting in either high pressure water or molten salt for it to heat, and dealing with thousands of moving parts that all have to line up and track the sun perfectly and which might, occasionally, cook a few birds in mid-flight. Don't get me wrong, this is a great bit of technology on paper. It combines renewable energy with storage: if you're heating up something like molten salt, you can save that power for hours to get you through the night. And there are other plants like it being built: there's one nearly completed in the Atacama Desert in South America. But right now, this is expensive. It might not have been, if history had taken a different track, if research had poured into these instead of regular solar panels: but as it is, the future probably isn't quite this bright."
99,"Cold Wars, Cruise Ships, and the Northwest Passage","Iâm in Resolute, Nunavut, Canada, the last stop on my Arctic voyage. It is one of the most northern and coldest inhabited places in the world, and the only reason I'm allowed to film here right now is because we have someone on polar bear watch. There is some evidence of prehistoric settlement here, but this town didnât exist until 1947, when the US and Canada built a weather station here, and it wasnât populated until 1953, when the government of Canada forcibly resettled Inuit from Northern Quebec here as part of a power play in the Cold War. The High Arctic relocation is a dark chapter in Canadaâs history, and the stories of those who were moved into appalling conditions, are tales best told by people who were there, not some British tourist. There are links in the description for context, and I strongly recommend you watch them. But what I can talk about is why the 1950s Canadian government thought it was worth uprooting people from their homes and moving them this far north. The North Pole, and most of the Arctic Ocean, are international waters. Thereâs no land below the ice, so theyâre treated the same as the Atlantic or Pacific. But unlike countries further south, where itâs easy to say where your coastline ends and the sea begins, up here in the north itâs a little bit more complicated. In the fifties, there was an open legal question: if no one lived on these northern islands, if theyâre not even habitable, could they really be part of Canada? Particularly when the United States is sending hundreds of soldiers up here to stake a claim, to shore up the defense against Soviet Russia. The shortest route from Russia to America for aircraft carrying nuclear bombs, and later, for intercontinental ballistic missiles, was over the North Pole. Over here. Over Resolute. And while the Canadian government were happy to co-operate with America, they were not about to risk being pushed out. The government's solution, back then: move some people who they think donât matter, and make it clear to the world: this is Canadian territory. Look. Canadians live here. The repercussions from that still go on today, and so does the argument about sovereignty up here: just for different reasons. Because while the Cold War has ended, and missiles will hopefully not be flying over the North Pole any time soon, there is now a very different question. Climate change means that the Northwest Passage, the once legendary sea route through the north of Canada, is now theoretically open for shipping a few months a year. The north of Canada is not just frozen ice that goes all the way to the pole, and most of the maps you see are really misleading. This here is one of a cluster of islands, nowhere near as big as they look on most maps, and if thereâs no ice between them, itâs a shortcut. The Arctic is now a possible route between Europe and the west coast of America, instead of going through the Panama Canal: and that cuts over 4000 miles off the journey. And the first cruise ship has already gone through: by the time you watch this, it will have gone through. And it's not an old icebreaker with a hundred people on it like Iâm travelling on, but a massive cruise ship with thousands of people, eight restaurants, and a casino. Like it or not, this town, this space here: this is part of a tourist route now. Now, Canada says some of the Northwest Passage is part of their territorial waters, almost like a big, wide river. Anyone going through should be cleared with them, be subject to Canadian law, and perhaps in future, they should pay a tax. The US and Europe? They say itâs international waters and they can do whatever they want. And the consequences could be serious: if this does become a major shipping route, then sooner or later thereâs going to be a major shipping accident, particularly if climate change brings unpredictable storms to the ocean here. The idea of more oil being spilled in the Arctic is worrying a lot of people. In a few decades, as the ice melts, more channels open, and drilling for oil and gas becomes possible, our next international battles, political or otherwise, might be for the Arctic: not just about who owns it, but for its entire future. Hi, I'm Chris Hadfield, this is... I'm Tom Scott! This is Tom Scott, we're here in the Arctic. That's it from Generator Arctic! That's all! Thank you very much!

100,áá» áá³á¦ and áááá®áá¸áá¦,"I'm at the Eureka weather station in Nunavut, in the Canadian High Arctic, about 80 degrees north. Here they provide weather reports not just for the Arctic, but for the transatlantic flights high above it. Because we're in Nunavut, there are three official languages here: English, French, and the local language: Inuktitut. Although itâs difficult to be exact about languages in the Arctic: the line between dialects and languages gets blurred, people in different areas can understand some of people say. Like most languages here, Inuktitut is polysynthetic, which means that something that needs a whole sentence in English can just be one long word, with each part affecting all the others. Now, in Greenland, similar languages are written using the Latin alphabet, but the words can seem unwieldy to English-speakers. The Latin alphabet is a writing system that evolved for a completely different language, one with lots of short words and spaces. But there is an alternative, it's used all round northern Canada, and to my eyes, itâs really cool. A bit of history: the reason this writing system exists is because it was invented by Christian missionaries who were trying to spread the gospel. The first books printed in Inuktitut were extracts from the Bible. Iâve put some links in the description to provide some context there, but: thereâs no way I can cover that in a short video thatâs mostly about linguistics. First up: this is not an alphabet. In an alphabet, vowels and consonants both have letters, which makes sense when youâve speaking a language with a lot of complicated combinations of sounds in it. But Inuktitut, like a lot of polysynthetic languages, has a relatively simple syllable structure: with rare exceptions, the maximum you can have in a syllable is a consonant, some vowels, and then another consonant. That is it, that is all your options. A long, English one-syllable word like âscratchedâ wouldnât work here: you need to put vowels in those consonant clusters. You need se-ce-ra-te-ched. Long vowels being written with two letters, that's also added to the long words, so the Latin alphabet gets a bit overwhelmed. But the Inuktitut script is not an alphabet. It is an abugida. Each symbol represents both a consonant and a vowel. The shape of the symbol tells you the consonant, and here is the clever part: the direction it's pointing tells you the vowel. And if itâs got a dot above it, itâs a long vowel, like aa instead of a. Iâm not going to get the vowels exactly right, Iâm English. And if thereâs a little symbol, up afterwards, you add another consonant at the end. So my name, Tom, would be like this: the curve shape means T, it's pointing to the right, which means âuâ, the closest you can get to an o here, and the right angle at the end means a closing M. Tum. If your accent's different, you might transcribe it a little differently, you might flip the curve the other way. Tam. And if you're American, you'd add a little dot there for a long vowel. Taam. So here is a simple word in Inuktitut: anaana. Mother. Like almost every language in the world, the word for mom is a sound that a baby will make accidentally. Sorry parents, it was probably an accident. A triangle means no consonant, and pointed left always means a simple âaâ. Next, that shape means ânâ, pointing left means âaâ, and the dot means long. ânaaâ. Then the same again, without the dot. ânaâ. Annana. The word for father is ataata. Swap those spools out for the curve, the T from Tom, and there you go. Ataata. And yes, of course itâs more complicated than this, Iâm literally speaking baby talk, but compare this to the Latin alphabet where there's just arbitrary symbols that you have to learn. Thereâs design here. There's intent. There isn't complicated letters with unwritten rules that all influence each other. This is an easy script to learn, and for an endangered language with only about 30,000 fluent speakers? That is a really good attribute to have.

101,Internet to the Arctic: A Greenlandic Relay Station,"This is not a normal video. I have about 20 minutes until the boat carrying me back to my ship leaves, but I am currently on a hill in Ilulisset in Greenland, along with John, who works for Tele Post Greenland, and Jakob, who is my translator here, and who is also holding my microphone inside his coat! And the reason we're here is because this is the microwave relay site for this entire town and, by extension, everywhere north. And John here has kindly agreed to answer a few questions. This, er, this is going to be a slightly rough video! The largest package you can get is about four megabits. And how long does it take you to upload something? Ah, well, the upload speed is .7 megabits per second. So it takes a horrendous amount of time to upload anything. There's a line of sight all the way from the south, from mountaintop to mountaintop, all the way up here, and way up north. So we should actually be able to see the other relay tower. Where is the next relay station? [Speaks Greenlandic] Where is the next one? [Speaks Greenlandic] Near Qasigiannguit. Ah! All right. So the next relay station is about 40km south of here, in Qasigiannguit. It's an unbroken link. But, of course, there can be some obstructions. [Speaks Greenlandic] There's actually a fun little story about the next village up, it's only 8km away, but there was a huge iceberg that shadowed it from here, so they actually had no internet this summer. But also if there's a relay station which loses power, down south, we might actually also lose it up here. So there was a whole day where there was no internet up here due to a relay station that had some bad batteries, I think it was. If there's a southern station that goes out, all the way up north, there's no signal. [Speaks Greenlandic] They can't pull the sea cable away through here, due to these massive icebergs. They scrape along the bottom of the ocean, so for next year they're going to upgrade all the system. They're going to pull the sea cable all the way from Nuuk, all the way to Aasiaat, which is about 120km-ish that way. And they're going to upgrade these cell towers to carry high-speed connections, all the way up to Uummannaq as well. [Speaks Greenlandic] During the winter, these domes get covered up fully with ice, so they need to go and, er... John, thank you so much! Jakob, holding my microphone, thank you so much! You're welcome. That was not exactly the usual sort of video... Let me turn this camera right. There we go! That was really not the sort of usual video that I do, but thank you very much, Jakob here just kind of emailed me when I said I was coming here, and said ""do you want to film a thing?"" -Thank you! -You're welcome. Let me move that camera... there we go. Thank you so much! That's brilliant! I'm here with Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and so's he! My name is Tim Kellner, I have a YouTube channel ""Tim to the Wild"", and I make short, little cinematic travel films. Go check out everything by him and all the other folks out on this project!"
102,No-One Knows Who Got To The North Pole First,"Up there is the bridge of the Kapitan Klebnikov, the Russian icebreaker thatâs taking me, and the rest of Chris Hadfieldâs expedition, around the Arctic. Nowadays, navigation up there, and, well, on most ships is mostly automatic, it's handled by GPS and computer-driven charts. But hidden away up on that bridge is an emergency backup that's roughly the same as explorers have been using for centuries. It's a sextant, and it's used for celestial navigation. You get the angle between the horizon and a known star, even the sun, at least, when it's not cloudy, consult a lookup table and do a bit of maths, and you have your latitude. Now a hundred years ago, when a sextant was the only way to navigate, the claims of explorers had to mostly be taken on the records that they keptâ¦ or else just on faith. To this day, no-one is entirely sure who it was who first made it to the North Pole. Frederick Cook claimed to have reached it in 1908, but his records donât really add up, and his evidence was questioned, particularly by a man who claimed to have made it to the Pole a year later: Robert Peary. By most accounts Peary was a thoroughly unpleasant man, but for many years he was widely considered to have led the first expedition that actually reached the North Geographic Pole in 1909. Thereâs a memorial to him on a high ridge at Cape York in Greenland, although, admittedly, it was placed by his widow. But he was the only one on the final part of his expedition who was trained in navigation, the only one who knew how to use a sextant, and all his really claims donât add up in hindsight. He almost certainly -whoa -didnât reach the Pole. Then there was US naval officer Richard Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, who claimed to have flown over the pole: but there were a lot of holes in their data too, a lot of overprecise sextant results that couldnât possibly be right. Even the makers of their aircraft said they were unlikely to have made it. And itâs not like any of them could leave a flag or a marker. The north polar pack ice, the thick stuff, not the thin stuff we're going through, the thick stuff, is still just floating around on the Arctic Ocean, and it drifts back and forth. Roald Amundsen led the first expedition that provided convincing evidence they reached the pole, by airship. But they didnât land there, they just flew over it: it was after the Second World War, in 1948, when a Soviet expedition finally set foot at the exact geographic North Pole, after flying there. Other explorers reached the Pole over the pack ice, with air support, but the first confirmed surface expedition to the North Pole without resupply: it took until 1986, when after several attempts, Will Steger finally achieved something that most of us would assume some Edwardian explorer had managed decades earlier. Nowadays, if you have enough money, you can fly to the Pole, or you can take a nuclear-powered icebreaker, you can check your GPS to confirm it, and you can send a selfie back via satellite phone. We are not going that far north on board this ship, and we donât have a nuclear reactor to give us enough power to get through the thick ice up at the pole. But if all the fancy technology on this bridge fails, we can still use the same technique as explorers centuries ago: and track our position by the stars. At least, where we can see them. I'm on this trip because of Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and so is this man! My name is Ben Brown, and I am so lucky to be here right now! Go check out his videos, he provided the amazing drone shots for this, links are on screen or in the description now. -Thanks, bro! -That's okay!"
103,The Front Falls Off: Glaciers Don't Go Backwards,"This is the Ilulissat Icefjord. Miles upstream, behind millions of tons of floating ice, is the Jakobshavn Glacier. And if the Greenland ice sheet melts, a good bit of the water will be coming down this way. But a glacier isnât a solid thing, itâs not some monolithic block of ice thatâs steadily melting. Glaciers flow. Itâs a really counterintuitive concept, because most of the world is used to thinking of ice in terms of frozen lakes, where the ice isnât going anywhere. And let's be honest, this doesnât look like itâs moving. But glaciers arenât static: they gain mass by having snow fall on them, and they lose mass by a process called calving: the front falls off and generates a stream of icebergs like this. Like a river, the glacier flows downhill. And the Jakobshavn glacier is one of the fastest and most productive in the world: at the terminus, where the front falls off, it can move at 20 metres a day. And remember, that doesnât mean the front of the ice is moving towards us at 20 metres a day, just that on average, the front bit of the ice is moving at that speed when it falls off and forms these icebergs. If a glacier is gaining mass, it will steadily advance, spreading out into the sea beyond until enough of the front falls off that it reaches equilibrium. And if itâs losing mass, because thereâs not enough snow, or because itâs melting more quickly, it will steadily retreat. Remember, thatâs not ice actually going into reverse, itâs still flowing the same, itâs just that the point where the front falls off is moving backwards. It's still producing icebergs. And the Jakobshavn glacier there? It produces a lot of icebergs. Thereâs a decent chance that the one that sank the Titanic came down here. Now, I donât want to debate climate change. Some very shrill people in the comments probably will though, so Iâll say this: sure, the data is noisy. From the 1960s to 2000, the actual front of the glacier here barely moved â and then in ten years, it retreated about the same amount as it had in the entire 20th century. But climate change is about trends, not events, and if you donât believe the enormous mountain of evidence by now, then someone with no earth science credentials talking into a camera in the Arctic isnât going to convince you either. And part of the reason for that is that itâs difficult to get across the sheer scale of what Iâm seeing here. The camera canât show you it. Even standing here in person, my brain is refusing to accept just how massive everything is. And we're only seeing the 10, 20% of these above water. Some glaciers will produce blocks of ice literally the size of Manhattan. And yes, theyâll break up, yes, theyâll settle down to be something weâre more used to, but like so many processes on our planet, this is on a scale that is pretty much unimaginable to humans. Itâs no wonder that the details of climate change are difficult to understand: Iâm standing here, watching the ice slowly flow, and I still canât get my head around this. I'm here with Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and so's she! Hello! That's Elmo Keep, she's writing wonderful profiles of some of the people we meet out here. Follow her on Twitter to see when they're published. Goodbye!"
104,Seeing Things: Visual Disturbances We All Experience,"I'm on my way back from the Arctic, but there is time for one more guest video! And it's from InÃ©s at Draw Curiosity, who's talking about those weird floaty things that you get in your eye sometimes. So Tom's taken his eyes off his channel and he's invited me to talk to you about 4 visual phenomena and disturbances that we all experience, and you don't have to go particularly far for any of them. For the first one, all you need to do is to look at a blank wall, or up at the sky, and you'll probably notice some dark grey spots floating around. These are floaters and what you're seeing are the shadows cast by bits of debris which have come loose from the back of the eye. They come in all shapes and sizes because the proteins and the cells can clump together in different manners and you can even estimate whereabouts in the eye they are based on their appearance. The sharper the shadows appear to be, the closer they are to the retina, and those that are blurrier and less defined are closer to the centre of the eye. Although the can be a bit annoying, as long as they haven't appeared suddenly, they're completely harmless. Whilst you're still up looking at the sky you'll probably also notice some white spots floating around. This is known as the blue entoptic phenomenon, and what you're seeing are your white blood cells being pumped through a network of blood vessels that's in front of the retina. Our brain actually does a great job of correcting the shadows cast by these blood vessels onto the retina, but because they're composed of a majority of red blood cells, it means that the white blood cells which are a different colour, shape and size don't get filtered out as well. But much like the floaters, they don't really affect everyday vision. Now so far, the two things I've told you about are real objects found inside our eyes, but the next two are artefacts that aren't there at all. Visual snow is a phenomenon that everyone reports experiencing to some degree, and it's the appearance of a static or grainy like texture over all or parts of the visual field. Personally, I find it to be the most noticeable over dark colours or in the dark, and it reminds me of footage shot on a camera with a high ISO. High ISO refers to a high sensitivity setting on the sensor, which means that is a lot more sensitive to light, but also a lot more prone to noise, which you can see in the grainy footage around me. Now whilst we can explain grainy texture in cameras, we don't actually know what causes visual snow but we believe it to be neural, which means it has a lot more to do with the neurons and the way nerves process these signals, as opposed to the eye structure itself. And last, but not least, are phosphenes. I'm sure you've heard the expression ""to see stars"", and if you've ever received a blow to the head, or you've coughed particularly hard, you know what that expression means, those are phosphenes. Likewise, if you've ever rubbed your eyes, or tapped the sides of them, you've probably seen some pretty geometric shapes appear before them, and these are also phosphenes. Generally, the images that we see are the result of light stimulating our photoreceptors at the back of the eye, but they can also be triggered in other manners, for instance, mechanically. If I tap the side of my eye, I'm actually changing the pressure inside it, and this causes some of the photoreceptors to fire and cause those sparks and pretty geometric shapes that we see. We also know that phosphenes can arise in the brain. People who take psychedelic drugs also report seeing phosphenes, and some scientists found that if you pass a gentle electric current through the brain's visual cortex, you will also report seeing some pretty geometric shapes. These were the 4 disturbances that I wanted to talk to you about today, and I think it just goes to show how complex and fascinating our visual system really is, and adds a whole new layer of meaning to the expression, ""there's plenty more, than meets the eye"" InÃ©s, thank you very much! Go subscribe to Draw Curiosity, there are links on screen or in the description now. Also in the description is a link to InÃ©s' blog post with the full research notes and bibliography for the video you've just seen. That is it for the guest videos! Unless I've been eaten by a polar bear, in which case this will be a very ironic end tag, I am back next week, and I'll see you then."
105,Why Mountain Dew Rots Your Teeth More Than Coca-Cola,"I am still in the Arctic, so todayâs guest video comes from Chase at ScienceC, who sent in the best pitch out of all the 150 that I got. And it started, âhi Tom, Iâve got two of my sisterâs teeth dissolving in sodaâ. I have a confession to make. I love Mountain Dew. I think my weather balloon video alone probably took a few 12-packs. Mountain Dew isnât exactly known to be the healthiest beverage out there. So today, Iâm going to do a little experiment to see just how bad Mountain Dew is for your teeth. So right here, I have two of my sisterâs molars. Iâm going to be soaking them in both a bottle of Mountain Dew, and a bottle of Coca-Cola for the next three weeks. So letâs see what happens! These teeth have been soaking in the soda for two weeks and five days. Before we take them out and weigh them, letâs get a little background on this soda. So the Mountain Dew right here has a pH of around 3.1 whereas the Coca-Cola has a pH of 2.5 making it six times more acidic than the Mountain Dew. So letâs take these teeth out, and see how much their mass has changed. Iâm going to pour the Mountain Dew out here, and get the tooth outâ¦ I got the tooth out, and as you can see, it looks a lot more yellower, especially at the base of it, than before. Whoa, whoa, whoa... This tooth does not look very good at all. It is all black around the crown, and it just looks disgusting and nasty. So Iâm going to clean it up with a little bit of water. So now that Iâve gotten these teeth dried off, if you look really closely, you can actually see that a lot of the enamel that was there â the white stuff â is gone where it previously was before. And on the Coca-Cola tooth, you canât really see a whole lot, because itâs so stained. Now the teeth are sufficiently dried off, letâs weigh them. So the Coca-Cola tooth weighs .80 g, meaning that itâs .06 g lighter than it was before. Now, if you look at the Mountain Dew tooth, we can see that it is .81 g, meaning that it is 13 hundredths of a gram lighter than it was before. Now if we adjust for the initial mass of the teeth, we can see that the Mountain Dew tooth lost 14% of its mass, while the Coca-Cola tooth only lost 7% of its mass. Half of what the Mountain Dew lost. Since Coca-Cola is six times more acidic than Mountain Dew, you would expect it to have a higher decay rate than Mountain Dew. This is not the case for two factors. And that first factor is titratable acidity, or TA. So pH is a measure of the level of acidity. That means that Coca-Cola is more acidic than Mountain Dew. However, Mountain Dew has a higher titratable acidity than Coca-Cola. Meaning that it has more acid than Coca-Cola. This means that it takes longer for the saliva in your mouth to dilute that acid than it would for most cola drinks. In addition to this, itâs also the type of acid thatâs added that makes the difference. So Mountain Dew, just like most non-cola beverages, has citric acid added into it. And citric acid is an organic acid, meaning that it will be able to break down the calcium in your teeth faster than inorganic acids like the phosphoric acid found in most cola beverages. This ultimately means that Mountain Dew is worse for your teeth than Coca-Cola, even though Coca-Cola is way more acidic and thatâs something that you might not have known. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, Chase! Thought Iâd left that catchphrase behind. Go subscribe to his channel, heâs got some wonderful videos coming up, links on screen or in the description now. Letâs face it, heâs going to have my job in 5 or 10 yearsâ time, youâre getting in early. Next time, we have, well, a very familiar part of China."
106,The Battery That's Lasted 176 Years,"Iâm off to the Arctic for three weeks. And while Iâm gone, some guest presenters are going to be taking over this channel. We start with Sally le Page, a biologist from Oxford University, who is going to be talking about the worldâs longest lasting battery. Be nice, be kind, Iâll see you in three weeks. Take it away, Sally! Iâm in the Clarendon lab in Oxford, where physicists keep a battery with the longest battery life the world has ever seen. It powers the Oxford Electric Bell, and itâs been running almost continuously for over 176 years. It was bought by the Reverend Robert Walker, who was a reader in experimental philosophy at Oxford. Thatâs what they used to call physicists in those days, and should hopefully give you an idea of quite how long ago weâre talking. He brought it back in 1840. So letâs just take a second to put that in some context. If we skip back another 60 years, the year is 1780. Mad King George is still on the British throne, the US declared independence just four years earlier, and Napoleon is still a schoolboy. Over in Italy, a physicist, Luigi Galvani, was dissecting a frogâs leg with metal tools, but when he touched the nerve, he saw the frogâs muscles twitch and he thought that this was âanimal electricityâ. Another Italian physicist, Alessandro Volta, heard of this experiment, and realised that the frogâs leg was just a fancy electrolyte that allowed current to flow between the copper and iron tools that Galvani was using. And Volta went on to invent the first ever battery in 1800, called the voltaic pile, made by piling up discs of copper and zinc â well, here Iâve got aluminium foil â and sandwiching them with discs of cardboard that was soaked in brine. And by piling up cells like this, you can see that you produce a battery, and it still works! And then in 1825, the London instrument makers Watkin and Hill made this: the Oxford Electric Bell and the dry pile battery that powers it. And although it was just 25 years after Volta invented the first ever battery, this battery here went on to outlive every single other battery the world has ever produced and has won the Guinness World Record for the worldâs most durable battery. How does such an old battery last so long? Well, itâs a dry pile battery, so itâs got a paste inside with the minimum amount of water needed for the electrolyte to work. And all that water is kept in with this solid sulfur coating. But beyond that, we donât really know whatâs inside it. Looking at diagrams of other batteries from around the time, itâs probably got about 2000 of these discs made from zinc and manganese dioxide all stacked up. But to find out what itâs exactly made of, weâd have to cut it open and end its 176-year run. In this time, the bells have run around 10 billion times, give or take, although this is an active physics laboratory, so thankfully for all the physicists around here itâs now inaduble and itâs behind two panes of glass. Each time the bell rings, the clapper takes a tiny one nanoamp of current, but the voltage between the bells is a whopping 2 kilovolts. Thatâs nearly 10 times the voltage of UK mains electricity. How long can it keep on running for? Well, no one really knows. The people round here reckon that the bell will break from wear and tear long before the battery runs out of power. In 1841, just one year after Oxford bought the bell, the instrument makers themselves wrote in a letter, âThe residual electrical power sufficient to keep up the ringing of the bells âseldom lasts more than three or four years. âItâs a pretty apparatus, but alas, âvery transient in its working powers.â How wrong could they be? That was Sally le Page, she has some great videos on her channel, check it out â links are on screen or in the description now. Thank you also to the University of Oxfordâs physics department for letting us film the bell. Next time: we have someone with some teeth dissolving in soda."
107,The Problem With Renewable Energy (and how we're fixing it),"For a few hours in May 2016, for the first time in more than a century, Britain was burning zero coal to generate electricity. None at all. All the coal-fired power plants were turned off. And this here is one of the reasons why. Welcome to the Griffin Wind Farm in Scotland. 68 turbines, more than 150 megawatts of capacity. And the turbines rotate and trim the blades to track the wind in real time. At full output, this can power entire cities just from the wind. But as the world moves to renewable energy, weâve got a little bit of a problem. Because coal, oil, gas, and nuclear stations are basically just giant boilers. They take water, they heat it up, that turns to steam, the steam gets forced through a massive turbine which rotates and generates power. When I say turbine, I donât mean like the blades here, I mean hundreds of tonnes of steel rotating thousands of times a minute. And all those turbines, all around the grid, rotate in sync with each other. After gearing, they all move at 50 cycles a second. 60 in America. All perfectly in time: one slows down, they all slow down. One speeds up, they all speed up. And that is what stops your lights from constantly flickering. Because electricity supply has to always match demand, pretty much exactly. There isn't a battery in the world big enough to store power on a national scale. So if a power station suddenly falls off the grid for some reason, then whereâs that supply going to come from? And the answer is the kinetic energy thatâs already in those turbines, in that spinning thousands of tonnes of steel around the country. Homes and factories will literally suck the kinetic energy out of that turbine to cover the gap, starting to slow it down. But that wonât cause a problem for 60 seconds or so, and in that time the National Grid Control Centre will, I donât know, throw another nuclear rod on the barbie and up the power output from other stations. They'll cover the demand. But, well, that relies on having enough rotational mass, enough system inertia, as itâs called. And here, in this turbine? Well, you can see. Thereâs no hundreds of tonnes of spinning steel, just some blades, a bit of metal, and some circuitry that feeds the power into the grid at the right frequency. If the whole grid were running on just wind and solar, there's no rotational mass. There's no grid stability. The minute that supply and demand mismatch, breakers would trip, and the whole thing would fall apart. Now there are some possible solutions to this. Pumped hydro storage has been around for a while, which is where you have two lakes at different heights. When youâve got too much power, you pump water up, and when youâve got not enough, you drop it back down again through generators. But that takes seconds or minutes to kick in. Thereâs also some experiments going on with things like molten glass storage, compressed air storage, and flywheels, but theyâre all experimental at the minute and not particularly efficient. The actual solution may come from somewhere a little unexpected. Because yes, wind is replacing coal and oil, but itâs also replacing petrol, the gasoline that you put in your car. And as more and more and electric cars get connected to the grid, well, youâve got a load of quite large batteries with computers. Your car could sell power back to the grid in real-time, second by second, as itâs needed. Combine that with smart appliances and meters that can watch the grid and work out when would be the best time to turn on your air-conditioning and fridge is, and you have a grid that does a lot of the balancing itself. Yes, we will probably always need a turbine somewhere, some big spinning mass of steel to cover the little glitches second to second, but the solution to balancing a power grid is not what we thought it was 20 years ago. Itâs not big, monolithic batteries. Itâs millions of small ones up and down the country. Thank you very much to all the team from SSE who have helped get me, and my team, up on top of this wind turbine. I am incredibly grateful. They have gone above and beyond to help out, so please, have a look at the links in the description for more about them, and about the Griffin Wind Farm. [Translating these subtitles?

108,The Mushroom Cloud Over Britain: RAF Fauld and the Hanbury Crater,"To most people, mushroom clouds mean nuclear explosions: the threat of radioactive fallout, of mutually assured destruction and of the end of the world. But they don't have to be: any large enough explosion will cause a mushroom cloud. And it's happened in Britain: right here. This crater was once RAF Fauld, an old mining operation converted to an underground bomb storage depot for the Royal Air Force. Underground storage was meant to be safer: one of the problems with munitions dumps is that the enemy just needs to hit them with one bomb and the whole lot goes up. This site seemed perfect: but there was a problem. Because this was built in the 1930s for small bombs, the sort that one person can carry, the sort that you can move on a conveyor belt, the sort that the Army can fire from a field gun across the trenches. That's why these old quarries with all their tunnels and caverns were perfect. But then the Second World War moved on, and bombing became a job for the Air Force, and the bombs got bigger and bigger and bigger, fast: half a ton, one ton, two tons. And the war effort needed many, many more bombs than had been predicted. Rapid changes in supply and demand meant that the underground depots were filled far beyond anything like their original capacity. By the end of 1944, the men here at RAF Fauld were storing stacks of high incendiary bombs outside the mine until they could find space inside. There was a war on. They had to make it work. Monday, 27th November, 1944. The commanding officer was on leave. The officer responsible for the underground stores was also on leave -and it was his deputy's day off too. Everyone who was down in the depot and in charge was inexperienced and massively overworked. According to the official inquiry, someone tried to remove a detonator from a live bomb with a brass chisel. And brass chisels cause sparks. In Morocco, 1500 miles away, seismographs recorded what felt like a distant earthquake. A hundred miles away, people heard a rumble carried on the wind. Four miles away, a shock wave blasted out windows. And here: a mushroom cloud rose into the sky. 4,000 tonnes of bombs had gone up in one terrible chain reaction, the largest explosion ever in the British Isles. This crater was once a hill, with a farmhouse on top of it: no trace of that farmhouse, or the people who lived there, was ever found. The bombs that hadn't immediately exploded were thrown into the air and rained down for miles around, along with millions of tons of debris. A nearby dam collapsed, sending floodwaters down into factories and houses in a nearby valley. The exact death toll will never be known; at least 60, perhaps 90. It took months before all the bodies were recovered, and some were never found. And in the Air Force reports, held classified for years and years after the explosion, along with the names of the dead and page after page itemising every bit of the destruction, there is this phrase: ""columns of black smoke and debris rose in gigantic mushroom form"". When you're rushed, when you're inexperienced, anyone can get complacent, anyone can cut corners, anyone can make a mistake. Even working with high explosives. Now slowly, over years, the crater was cleared and reclaimed; decades later, what remains is an odd scar on the landscape. About half the bomb store actually managed to survive the explosion; and while the bombs were removed, there are still tunnels and storage rooms hidden under the crater. But after careless explorers started damaging the site, all the known entrances were filled in. And given the warnings about unexploded bombs still in the crater, I'm not about to climb this fence and go any further. There is one little interesting note, though, right at the end of the story: through the late 40s and the 50s, the American military kept asking for records and details of the explosion. How big was it, exactly? What was the damage to the nearby land, and was it by earthquake or by blast wave? What happens if you, essentially, detonate something with the yield of a tactical nuclear bomb underground? Britain never answered. And America went on  to make its own mushroom clouds.

109,The Fake Vinegar In British Fish and Chip Shops,"This is non-brewed condiment. It's water, ethanoic acid, plus a few colourings and flavourings. And in almost the all the chip shops up and down Britain, this is the ""vinegar"" you'll get on the counter. And in the modern world, it has some advantages. It can be made from a concentrate, which is fine provided the owner of the chip shop actually remembers to dilute it. That went wrong a couple of times. It's also halal, because there isn't the tiny amount of alcohol in it that brewing regular vinegar causes. And some brands of it are actually gluten-free, which regular malt vinegar most definitely isn't. I've seen this sold at a premium as ""gluten-free vinegar"". But none of those are the reason that it's caught on. There are claims that it started in the temperance movement, the people who were against alcohol in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but I can't find a reliable source for that -ha, ""sauce"" -I can't find a reliable authority for that. The reason is, chucking some chemicals together is significantly cheaper than actually brewing vinegar. This stuff has been around for a long time, there's a reference to it in a 100-year-old report from Her Majesty's Inspector of Foods. Now legally, it can't be described as vinegar. Trading Standards, the local government agencies that enforce food laws, are really clear on that. It cannot be put in the traditional little bottles that people associate with vinegar. Except: every chip shop, up and down the country, doesn't care. And Trading Standards... they could go into every chip shop in the country and get an easy prosecution -but they don't. They've got better things to do, like tracking down food that will actually injure or harm you, and it's not like they'd see any of the money from fines anyway, that's not how it works. And most people don't know this isn't vinegar. And those of us who do know... actually don't care. It's not like margarine and butter, where the chemical make-up and health effects are actually different, it's just a slightly different taste and a slightly different make up. But no one cares. No one minds. Up and down the country, everyone agrees: it's fine. This is vinegar. So here's my question: does it matter? [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
110,"The Man Who Invented, Then Hated, Shopping Malls","Let me tell you about a man called Victor Gruen. Born in Austria, he moved to the United States just before the Second World War broke out and became an architect. And he looked at the suburban sprawl that was taking over America all the people just commuting back and forth, back and forth between home and work in their cars, and thought that what they needed was something like the old city centres and downtowns that he knew. What he needed was a city centre for the suburban sprawl and what he came up with was the idea for the shopping mall. 'Course, he had some more utopian vision for it. He thought, oh, this is going to be wonderful, there's going to be homes, and shops, and schools, and even hospitals, all working together and being this new space. Unfortunately, money and politics got in the way of his utopian visions and what you ended up with, twenty years later when the idea crossed the Atlantic, was this: Brent Cross Shopping Centre, described by a friend of mine as ""Hell on Earth on a Saturday"". It's the reason I've been driving around looking for a parking space for about half an hour. Now, Victor Gruen did not want this. He did not want these temples to consumerism with every psychological trick in the book designed to get you to buy. One of those psychological tricks got named after him: the Gruen Transfer, the idea that there are a few seconds after you walk in with all this new stimulus, where your brain just gets a little bit confused and almost hypnotises you into buying more. Doesn't matter whether it's true -it's probably not, the evidence is shaky, but what matters: it was named after him. And at that point, he was railing against what he called these ""bastard"" offspring of his original idea. Well, this is what we've ended up with. He died in 1980, at a point where there was a new shopping mall opening in the United States roughly every week or so. Which was not what he wanted... ...but things have changed. Economic downturns and the rise of the internet mean that now a lot of those old malls are closing down. And the new spaces that are popping up in their path? They're a lot more like his original designs. They're pedestrianised high streets, and they're big, open spaces with actual space to sit down that isn't just convincing you to buy. From beyond the grave, Victor Gruen might have the last laugh. Not that that helps me, when that guy just took the last parking space. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
111,Nobody's Exactly Sure How Much A Kilogram Is Right Now,"This is the kilogram. Not a kilogram, the kilogram. The British National Standard Kilogram, at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. It's a lump of platinum-iridium alloy, it's kept in a very very secure safe just under here, and it weighs... well, one kilogram. Mass measurement around the world needs to be equivalent. So if I buy something in America that's a milligram, or a kilogram, or 100 tonnes, I need to know that it's equivalent to a milligram, or a kilogram, or 100 tonnes in the UK. The real key areas of interest, where the uncertainties are very important, are, for example, the pharmaceutical industry where you're dealing with very, very small quantities of active ingredients and you have to measure them very, very accurately. So when, say, your bathroom scales were manufactured, they were tested against equipment that was tested against equipment that, several chains down the line later, was tested against something like this. And this was tested against the International Prototype Kilogram in Paris. And this is a really weird thing to wrap your head around, but that one in Paris? It always weighs a kilogram. It doesn't matter if it's gained a tiny amount of mass from adsorbing air contaminants, or lost a tiny amount when it was cleaned. It is one kilogram. We know that the International Prototype is probably not stable, because all its copies are unstable relative to itself. But there's nothing above the International Prototype that you can compare it with to tell whether it's changing or not. Defining international constants by a physical thing is... not ideal, so in the next few years, scientists round the world are deciding what the 21st century standard should be. The formal definition will be based on physics, likely Planck's Constant, but how do you make that into a physical thing? There are two options: first, a fixed number of atoms. You can manufacture 1kg sphere of almost-pure, single-crystal silicon relatively easily. What you have to measure here is the lattice spacing, ie how far the atoms are apart in the sphere, and the volume of the sphere. And both of those are measurements you can make at a level of uncertainty where you can generate a sphere which has an accuracy of a part in 10-to-the-8, roughly. The downside of that is it costs you â¬2.5million for a sphere. Finding the kilogram that way seems to make sense. We're measuring mass, after all. But there is an alternative which could be cheaper and easier, although it isn't quite as obvious. The watt balance is an electrical way of measuring mass. This is a way of demonstrating simply how a watt balance works. We have a loudspeaker here and if I pass a current through the coil of the loudspeaker, you can see that the cone will move up and move down. If I was to put a mass on here, if I restore the position of the mass, the current I need to do that is a measure of the weight of that mass. The problem I've got is that I don't know the strength of the field of the magnet, or the number of turns on the coil. And I can do a second experiment by moving the cone of the speaker, like that. If I was to measure the velocity with which I was moving that, and also measure the voltage which was produced, that would tell me that quantity and allow me to eliminate it from the two experiments. Which, if done accurately, is enough to work out the weight of that mass. Whichever approach gets chosen, there will still be physical reference kilograms in the world. They're not going away. But for the first time, we're going to have something absolute to compare them against. Thank you to everyone at the National Physical Laboratory! They have a YouTube channel that you can check out, and they occasionally hold open days. Details are on their web site. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
112,The Flower That Smells Like Death,"Here at the Eden Project, in the worldâs largest rainforest in captivity, one plant has been storing up its energy for years and years and years, and itâs just finishing releasing all that in one disgusting 48-hour period. This is a corpse flower, and it smells like death. It's a bit like a dead rat, mixed with rotten fish. Some people describe it like a bin that hasn't been cleaned out for maybe two or three weeks. It's the smell of decay. These plants use flies and beetles the way many plants use bees: for pollination. The smell of death: that's very attractive to flies and beetles looking for somewhere to lay eggs. These bloom only after it's managed to store enough energy, and that can take anywhere between 7 and 10 years. Titan arums bloom for just 48 hours. On the first night, it can only receive pollen. The second night, it releases pollen. It cannot self-pollinate. Over time, evolution will move species towards strategies with the greatest chance of reproductive success. And on the face of it, the corpse flowerâs strategy doesn't seem that good: just 48 hours every few years. I mean, surely a better idea would be reproduce as often as possible. And there are a lot of plants that do that, as anyone with hay fever knows. But there is another possible strategy: store up energy for years and years and years, and then burn it all in a couple of nights to send out a mating call so big that everyone can smell it for miles. It uses heat to make the smell travel further. These plants are thermogenic. They create their own heat. And they go up to around body temperature. It's able to send its scent way up above the canopy layer of the rainforest, where it can catch a breeze. And then insects can smell one of these in bloom over 3,000 metres away. It's the same temperature as a dying animal, and the smell is of rotting flesh. And -if you come in here -this colour, we normally see in the butchers'. This is the colour of flesh. So by many ways, it's trying to lure in those flies and beetles, thinking that they've found a corpse. Which does just leave us with the question of the smell. Now, I got here a few hours too late, it's apparently past its worst, but... ...yeah. Yeah, okay. That's bad! That's... Thank you very much to the Eden Project for inviting me here! Theyâve got a YouTube channel you can check out, and they are open year round in Cornwall, in the south west of England. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
113,Why You Can't Advertise Cancer Cures In Britain,"Behind me is the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital. And I'm here because it's been an interesting week for alternative medicine in Britain. This week, Noel Edmonds, television star, and promoter of mid-90s fever dream Mr Blobby, endorsed something called the EMP Pad. Itâs a yoga mat, and its inventors claim that its very low intensity electromagnetic fields help cells in the body function. Now, Iâm not going to go into loads of detail about the evidence for the Pad. Iâm very skeptical, but there are early studies that say carefully applied, specific electromagnetic fields may actually do some good. I know, I was surprised too. Okay, a yoga mat probably isnât going to work like that, but there are devices using EM fields that are working well enough that insurers are starting to pay for them. Iâll also skip over the insulting reaction that Noel Edmonds got from people on Twitter, particularly after he told someone suffering from cancer that it might be because of their ânegative attitudeâ. Instead, letâs look at the reaction of the folks who make the EMP Pad. Because, okay, the skeptics wonât like them whatever they do, but there are plenty of alternative medicine believers out there. Surely the company would welcome a celebrity endorsement? No. At the top of their web site, in big letters, they disavowed Noel Edmonds entirely. Nothing to do with us, they said. And the reason was: heâd claimed they could help cure cancer. Now across Europe, advertising prescription drugs and medical treatments to the public is banned. They can advertise to doctors, sure, but those American drug adverts with their list of side effects just donât happen here. ""Serious, sometimes fatal events such as infections, lymphoma, ""or other types of cancer have happened. ""Blood, liver and nervous system problems, serious allergic reactions, ""and new or worsening heart failure have occurred."" But in Britain, there are even stricter laws about cancer treatments. You canât get away with saying, ""oh, itâs not really a medical device"", or, ""oh, itâs just some herbs"". If you sell something to the public, saying it can help or cure cancer, you can be prosecuted. Even if it does cure cancer. The idea, back in 1939 when the law was passed, still holds true today. Sell your cure to doctors. If you give them an alternative medicine that works, with evidence to convince them, theyâll start prescribing it, and you, the person who discovered it, youâre probably in line for a Nobel Prize. And if they donât start prescribing it: well, it probably doesnât cure cancer, does it? If youâre selling your cure directly to the public, it's almost certainly not a cure. And itâs probably going to hurt people that would otherwise go to the doctor. With this law, no-one has to prove that your cure doesnât work: they just have to prove youâre selling it without going through someone qualified. Noel Edmonds was in the clear when he said âthis cures cancerâ. I think heâs irresponsible, but he can believe that, and heâs not selling any yoga mats himself. ""I then had my tumor destroyed by sound waves, ""proving yet again that energy is at the heart of this issue."" But the folks who do sell them: they needed to shut down that claim right away, or risk an investigation that they would really want to avoid. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
114,"Help, My Fusion Reactor's Making A Weird Noise","This is the control room for JET, the Joint European Torus at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. JET is a nuclear fusion experiment, a scientific research facility that's hopefully one step on the journey to plentiful, clean fusion power. When it's running, the reactor vessel is literally the hottest place in the solar system, ten times hotter than the core of the sun, and right now, we are just a couple of minutes away from an experiment -or as they call it here, a pulse. We're running a series of experiments at the moment looking at disruptions. Plasmas really don't want to be there. When they cease to be, they create quite a lot of mechanical energy which can shake the machine, and in future power plants we really want to try and mitigate against these problems. So right now, enormous, 700-tonne flywheels are being spun up to provide enough energy for the experiment. Less than a hundredth of a gram of gas is already in a vacuum vessel next to the torus, and when the pulse starts, it'll be pushed in and heated: by enormous magnets, by injecting hydrogen atoms, and just by dumping huge amounts of radio frequency power into it, making it into a superheated plasma. And then it'll hit about a hundred million degrees Celsius, and we will start to see nuclear fusion. With fission, you're always trying to slow it down and control that reaction. And we have exactly the opposite thing. And therefore it's not possible to see a situation where you could have a large-scale accident as you could with fission. Now, there are huge numbers of machine protection systems watching the experiment. If anything goes wrong, power gets cut and the whole system just stops. But if something's more subtly wrong, there's one safety feature you might not expect. Up in the ceiling are surround-sound speakers, hooked up to microphones in the reactor hall, where no human is allowed. Those speakers relay the sound from the experiment to the crew here in the control room in real time, as if they were standing -as if this point where I'm standing right here -was in the middle of the torus. And all the high-tech machine protection equipment here is necessary, every single bit of it. Computers can react so much faster than us: that human delay between incident and response could be the difference between a safe shutdown and some rather expensive repair bills. But if something is subtly wrong, like when you get a faint, weird noise in your car, humans might be able to notice before computers do. A couple of years ago, we had a disruption and we could hear this clanging noise. And we were able to pinpoint the exact area, and what we believed it was which was a clamp which held a pipe, and we were immediately able to walk into the area, go to where we believed it was, and found it -and then could replace it. The engineers here: they're taken a human ability -that feeling that's been honed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution, that something is just subtly wrong, something is off -and they've put it to work on one of the most incredible things that humanity has ever constructed. All right. Here goes the pulse. [Five, four, three, two, one, zero...] [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
115,"In Norway, Everyone Can Know How Much You Earn","In Britain, the reaction to the Panama Papers leak has been a bit weird. Politicians have been releasing summaries of their tax returns, all falling over each other to try and prove that they haven't got any offshore accounts or arguing strongly that they shouldn't have to prove that they don't have any offshore accounts. One of them said that requiring politicians to have public tax returns was ""reminiscent of the Stasi or the KGB"". Welcome to Norway. Behind me is the Oslo tax office. And if you want to know what a politician earns here, you can just ask them. It's not just politicians, though. It's everyone. Tax returns in Norway, Sweden and Finland have been public for years: the countries differ on how much detail they provide, and whether you need to have a good reason for asking -but fundamentally the amount you earn is public knowledge here. Now, at this point, we could do the news report thing, and cut to interviews with Norwegian people on the street, asking how they feel about this. Or: we could science it, and look at a paper by economist Ricardo Perez-Truglia of Microsoft Research. That paper combines two things: first, the Norwegian Monitor Survey, which, every two years, surveys a representative sample of Norwegians and includes questions about happiness and life satisfaction. And second, when finding out someone else's tax details went from ""you have to go here and look through a book, ""and you've only got three weeks in the year to do it"" to ""a newspaper has published everything online and there's a search box"". The paper concludes that wage transparency, that knowing whether you're keeping up with the Joneses, or the Johansens, doesn't make the populace happier overall. Instead, it increases the happiness gap: knowing for certain you're being paid more than your neighbours makes you more likely to be satisfied with your life. Knowing for certain that you're not doing as well? That hurts. You can still look up people's tax returns online in Norway, by the way. But lately, you have to log in as a taxpayer yourself, and everyone can see the records of who's been searching for them. That's a whole different social game right there. But there is another good argument for wage transparency: that it makes for a fairer world. There's no strong data on that yet, not that I can find, and it'd be extremely difficult to measure. But there's some good anecdotal evidence, particularly from an engineer at Google who created a spreadsheet where their colleagues could voluntarily share their salaries. The story around it, and how management reacted to that, is well worth a read. And there's also evidence that, although politicians might not like it, public disclosure of tax returns does reduce tax evasion. So does this mean I'm about to share my tax return, and report to the world how much I made last year? No. Because I'm British, because we don't talk about money, you might find out something you don't want to know... or you might hurt someone else. So my reaction to wage transparency is the same as a lot of people's: you first. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
116,Why You Should Write Down Your Goals,"At the turn of the millennium, ITV, one of the major British TV channels, decided to call the year 2000 their Year of Promise. They held a massive telethon, the Day of Promise, not to raise money for charity, but to get people to call in and promise... something. What we want you to do is: we want you to make a promise. -And by doing that, you'll make a mark in history. -Absolutely. The promises would be held forever, they said, in registers held up and down the country -and if you paid ITV some money, your promise would also be permanently inscribed at a historic site somewhere in the UK. Historic like the East India Dock basin, here. A few years later, and there's almost no sign that this ever happened. But to tell the truth, I could have said that in 2002 or 2003. The public didn't care about the Year of Promise, and ITV abandoned the whole scheme as soon as they could. At least, as soon as they could without losing face. The Internet Archive has most of their web site, and the National Library of Scotland seems to have the only available copy of a CD with all the promises on -but that's it. Some of the benches and monuments that are inscribed with promises still exist, like this one... but a lot of them have been destroyed or moved in renovations or just weathered away over time. Despite the millions that ITV spent on trying to leave a mark on history -their words, not mine -the promises have been almost forgotten. Designing something to last is incredibly difficult, even if it's not just a publicity stunt. But here's the thing: it might not matter. Research has proved an old urban legend: that writing down a goal or a promise makes you significantly more likely to do it. It helps if you tell someone else, it helps if you get it engraved on a monument somewhere. But just the act of committing to something in writing, even if you're the only one to see it, means that your human desire to stay consistent, to stay true to what you think your beliefs are, makes you more likely to achieve it. Or, at least, more likely to say that you've achieved it when a researcher calls and asks you about it later. So I don't know if Kay O'Grady really did overcome OCD, or Susan Moussa really did learn first aid. And perhaps the money that ITV spent on their ill-fated Year of Promise could have been better put to other things. But I'd like to think that all the promises, all the commitments, really did do some good in the world. Even if no-one actually remembers them now. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
117,Unexploded Bombs off the British Coast: the SS Richard Montgomery,"This is the Thames Estuary. It's a busy shipping lane, carrying everything from small pleasure boats to massive container ships between the London docks and the English Channel. Overhead is an approach path for some of London's air traffic. But right there, in the middle of the Estuary, two miles offshore: there are 1,400 tonnes of unexploded bombs. In 1944, the SS Richard Montgomery was transporting munitions for the US Air Force. She was moored here for the night, and a combination of bad weather and bad decisions meant she ran aground on the sandbank out there. The weight of the bombs broke the ship in two, and it's been sitting there ever since as the tide digs a little crater around it. Some of its cargo was cleared away, but not enough. If the worst happens, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. Seriously. As a comparison, the Russian army has tested something nicknamed the Father of All Bombs, which is the equivalent of 44 tonnes of TNT. This boat has 30 times that. There's an exclusion zone around it, of course, marked out and listed on charts. Occasionally some jackass will paddle up to the masts and pose for a photo, but let's be honest, if years of storms and shifting sands haven't set it off, that probably won't either. So what are the risks? Well, no-one's entirely sure. That's the problem. No-one knows what the conditions inside the ship are. And there's no research on what seawater does to bombs over more than half a century. They should be fine: they're in clear, cold water. And while the TNT itself doesn't degrade, its fuses will have worn away. Which would make it safe, if it weren't for the 2,500 cluster bombs on the deck above which could fall down on it, and which might have a slight tendency to unexpectedly degrade and explode even though they're not armed. Possibly. Depending on who you believe. So should something be done? The Coastguard, along with the Receiver of Wreck, the wonderfully-titled British civil servant in charge of this sort of thing: they publish regular reports on the ship, based on sonar and laser scans and occasional dives. The consensus view is that it's safe, but steadily degrading as tide and time take their toll. It's probably fine to do nothing. And trying to clear it, moving all that volatile material, well, that could be a much, much greater risk to life, let alone an enormous expense. And if it did go up, perhaps the water would contain most of the explosion. But no-one's certain. There are some extremely vocal people, most of whom live near the thing, who say the risk of leaving it is too great: the worst-case scenario is that, suddenly, there's one nudge by a wave in the wrong place at the wrong time -and the equivalent of a small nuclear bomb goes off, taking out the nearby towns -and the nearby liquid gas storage -first with a blast wave and then an actual wave. This ship isn't just interesting because of what it contains. It's interesting because it's an unknown. There are risky things like this all over the world, but generally we can quantify them, we can say it's a one-in-a-million chance. But this is a risk that it's impossible to put a number on, or say anything other than, yeah, it's probably going to be fine. Doing nothing is probably the right thing to do, and that's what the government's going to do. But we don't know it's the right thing to do, not for sure. The only way to know is to wait and see. And maybe buy some good insurance. ""Small, far away! Small, far away! ""Father Ted reference, Google it."" [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
118,"Power, Politics and Pragmatism: The British National Grid","Here, below London, 32km of new tunnels are nearly finished. But these aren't for people: they're for power. Cables carrying 400,000 volts will run through here, supporting the city as it keeps growing and keeps demanding more and more electricity. This project cost a billion pounds, all to keep the lights on. So how did we get to this? Back in the 1920s, electricity was generated by hundreds of small companies in towns and cities across the country. They were all different and mostly incompatible: London alone had 24 voltages and 10 frequencies. So if you moved to the next street over, you might have to replace all your light bulbs. If you had any light bulbs, that is: the cost of electricity was out of reach of nearly everyone. Now the answer might have been to do what other countries in Europe were doing: set up and enforce standards, regulate prices, maybe even nationalise the power companies. And bring the price down for everyone -people and business. Good plan in theory, but the trouble was that the Prime Minister at the time was Stanley Baldwin, and he led the Conservative party. Politically, he couldn't just assume control of private corporations! That was socialist. That was something that the Other Side did. So the solution was a very clever and very British compromise: the National Gridiron, later just National Grid. The Central Electricity Board, backed up by the government and run privately, would construct and own the central infrastructure. It would build a network of transmission lines sweeping across the country. The Grid would reduce the risk for the private generating companies and let them reach a much, much, larger market. If they wanted to connect and reach everyone, they had to meet the Grid's standards for frequency, for voltage, and for reliability. The greatest story I found while I was researching this is that originally, there were six separate grid areas spread all around the country, all run individually. It was judged too risky by their managers to actually connect them all into one National Grid. But it was theoretically possible. Sometimes two or maybe even three of those grid areas were connected to help out if one power station somewhere went down. So on the night of 29th October, 1937, without any permission, the engineers in the control rooms quietly decided to connect the whole country together for an hour or two and see what would happen. And it worked. And a year later, even their managers agreed: it was the only way to make sure the lights stayed on everywhere. And so while the level of regulation, and the level of privatisation, has changed over the years -as it has in pretty much every country in the world -and while the technology has developed to the point that instead of laying transmission lines, we are now in billion-pound tunnelling projects 60m under London, that mostly-private grid is what we still have today. It's listed on the London Stock Exchange. If history had turned out differently, perhaps this tunnel would have been a government operation: but even if it was, we'd have still needed this to keep the lights on. Thank you very much to the National Grid and all the folks who've helped bring me down to the Power Tunnels, along with Geoff from Londonist, who's done a video about these tunnels themselves and all the infrastructure around me.

119,What Counts as the World's Largest Clock?,"If you ask Google, then the largest clock in the world is the one atop the Mecca Clock Tower, one of the largest buildings in the world, in Saudi Arabia. Each face is 43 metres in diameter, and it can be seen for miles around. No. This is the actual largest clock in the world right now, at the Rheinturm, in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. I know what you're thinking, that's not a clock, that's a broadcast tower. In fact, there's a tower a bit like this in most major cities in Germany. It's kind of their thing. The view from the top is wonderful. But it's also an enormous clock... it's just a digital one. You see those lights on the side? Read them from top to bottom, each group as a number. 1, 7, 3, 2. 17 32. There's some seconds there on the bottom as well, but it's about half past five. And at more than a hundred metres high, that is a clock about twice the height than the one at Mecca, although admittedly it has a bit less surface area. But that brings me to a question: what counts as a clock? If you ask the Guinness Book of Records, the largest clock was a temporary structure. It had an area of more than eight square kilometres, and it was made with lasers at the 2011 Burning Man festival. That is so much bigger than this tower. But what if I took lights like the ones on the side of here, sent them round the world, so America had the hours, Europe and the Middle East had the minutes and Asia had the seconds, if I hooked them up so they all flashed together and acted as one big device... would that count? Could we, with a fairly small amount of effort, make a clock as big as the earth? And if so, would it count? Or does a clock need to be something that one person can just look at and actually use to tell the time? [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
120,How To Make Snow,"TOM SCOTT: The Youth Winter Olympic Games have brought me over to Lillehammer, in Norway. It's still early in the season here, so they are making snow. Because getting these slopes to competition standard isn't easy. ROGER HJELMSTADSTUEN: Here in Hafjell we have about 250 snow guns They're all controlled from a big control room and they all are connected together. It's a lot about planning. To put the guns at the right place. It's about wind, if you put it on the wrong side it's going to be a lot of snow in the trees. That's why we have two teams working night and day the whole fall, the whole winter, to make sure everything is perfect. TS: Here, in the snow gun, huge amounts of water and air are being forced through tiny nozzles, creating a fine mist that freezes into fresh powder. But while the weather is cold, the temperature is actually not quite below freezing here. So why does this water freeze into snow? Why doesn't it just... rain? Okay. Physics. As water evaporates, it sucks heat from the surrounding environment. Put some water on your hand and blow on it, and the wet part will feel colder because that evaporating water is sucking the heat away from your body. That's what's going on here. Some of these water droplets evaporate, so they drop the temperature around them. Which means other droplets might start to freeze. And once that's started, you get what are called nucleation sites: the start of snowflakes. And if it's not quite working efficiently enough, then you can buy a kind of protein slurry. You add it, very diluted to the water, and suddenly every droplet is a nucleation site and can form its own snowflake. RH: To make snow, we have pipes for water and pipes for air. On top of that, every cannon needs a computer cable. The water here in Hafjell comes from big lakes at the top of the mountain and from there it's natural pressure going down. That's the easiest and least expensive way. During a normal season, we use about 30,000 litres a minute. It sounds a lot, but we have a big, big lake so during the whole season it's about 5-10cm down and that's if no new water is coming in so most of the time, it just looks like it's not touched. TS: The drier the air is, the more water can evaporate into it. So if the air is really, really dry, 0% humidity, you can make proper snow when the air temperature is well above freezing, anything up to 6Â°C. But if the air is humid, there is nowhere for those droplets to evaporate to. At 100% humidity, when the air is saturated, the temperature has to be -2 or lower to make snow. 'Cos this isn't some kind of instant magic freezer. The laws of thermodynamics pretty much make that impossible. Much as it'd be great to have a snow gun that works in the middle of summer all you're going to end up with then... ...is a rainmaker. RH: So, snowmaking is really important for big contests, but it's also really important for just the average day here in Hafjell with normal people. It's what we need to make this mountain work. Without it we'd be nothing. We need snow! TS: There's a load more videos over on the Olympics channel and on my channel, go check 'em out, go subscribe, and thank you to the Youth Winter Olympic Games for bringing me out here to Lillehammer.

121,Calling The Police Doesn't Charge Your Phone Battery,"Thereâs an urban legend that dialling 999 -the British equivalent of 911 or 112 -there's an urban legend that dialling that number will charge your phone battery. And if you look online, youâll see a couple of police forces in the UK put out press releases saying itâs not true, donât do it, it ties up an emergency line. And there are articles and comment threads tearing into the people who believe this. How can they be so stupid? What idiot would believe this sort of thing? Except the weird thing is, itâs almost true. Do you remember Blackberries? They were those phones that businesspeople had before actual smartphones came along. Their UK headquarters is behind me, here in Slough. [Despairing] Slough. Back when Blackberry did have a market share above 1%, it wasn't just business people who used their phones: teenagers did too. BBM â BlackBerry Messenger â was the WhatsApp of its day. Instant, free, unlimited text messaging, as long as everyone you knew had a Blackberry phone âand as long as that phone had battery power. See, when certain types of BlackBerries were really low on battery, theyâd go into a locked-down âemergency calls onlyâ mode. No BBM. No anything. You werenât getting any use out of it. It just said âbattery too low for radio useâ. It'd let you call the emergency services, just in case, but nothing else. That was a fairly sensible idea by the BlackBerry engineers. But they went about it in a really half-assed way, and they didnât think what people would actually want to do with their phones. Because there are emergencies that donât involve calling 999. Being lost or alone or desperate, and just needing to reach one person. [sad music] Mum. I'm sorry. I've made a big mistake. I went to Slough. It turned out that on a Blackberry, if you made an emergency call and then hung up immediately... the radios in the phone stayed on. The phone stayed unlocked. With all its connections intact. Itâd last a good few minutes, as it drained the last bits of its power. Except if you locked it, or the screen turned off. Then, depending on the model, you might have to dial 999 again to unlock it. You can see where the myth came from. And mobile phone providers in the UK, they get charged somewhere around a pound every time someone calls 999 through them, even for an instant, so they werenât too happy about this either. Now, I'm not saying there isnât a space for careless code in the world, for quickly developed ideas. Heaven knows I've made enough of them. But start cutting corners in a phone that's used by millions of -was used by millions of people, and suddenly youâve got enough hoax calls coming in that it starts to block actual emergencies. Tiny decisions that end up making a big difference. I'm going to get out of Slough now. [Translating this video? Add your name here if you'd like credit!]"
122,Crosswalks Don't Always Make You Safer,"Abbey Road! The Beatles' famous crosswalk -or zebra crossing, as we'd call it in Britain, because of the black and white stripes and the weird thing we have about naming our crossings after creatures. Now, jaywalking -crossing the road where there isn't a marked crossing -isn't illegal in most of Britain. We can cross wherever it's safe. Which is just as well, given the complicated layout of our cities, and given how often day trippers recreating that album cover hold up traffic here on what is actually a fairly busy London road. But crossing the road safely, wherever you are, requires both the people driving and the people walking to take care. Yes, a driver not paying attention could kill someone -but someone on foot could walk out into traffic without looking, assuming they're safe because, hey, it's a crosswalk, and even the best driver with brand new brakes has a limit on how quickly they can stop. And there's plenty of research to say that, in some situations, marked crosswalks like this one are actually less safe. The US Department of Transportation analysed five years of data from 1,000 marked crosswalks, and 1,000 matching sites that had no markings. On roads like this? The markings made no difference. On bigger, multi-lane roads? A marked crosswalk is more dangerous, probably because if a car stops in the first lane, pedestrians don't always have a sightline to see any cars still speeding past in the second -and the cars can't see them either. Does that mean we should remove all the road markings and let everyone fend for themselves? Well, we can work it out. There are ""shared space"" schemes, based on studies from the Netherlands, like this one in Exhibition Road in London. The theory is because there aren't strict road markings, everyone is more cautious, cars go a bit slower, and people look both ways. Great in theory, maybe not so good if you're blind or partially sighted. The debate about whether this is a good thing is still going on. And ultimately, the only way to be sure, is for pedestrians to look when they're crossing the road -and drivers to assume that people on foot aren't paying attention to you. 'Cos at Abbey Road? They mostly aren't. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here for credit!]"
123,Why Britain Sucks At Product Placement,"In 2014, some British YouTube stars were called out by the British advertising regulators for not properly declaring sponsored content. They mentioned the sponsorship in the description, they said ""thanks to the company for making this possible"" at the end: it wasn't like they were trying to hide it, but it wasn't enough. It had to be clear before you clicked on the video, that it was an advert. In a world so saturated with advertising: why was that a problem? Well, British media has some of the strongest product placement laws in the world. Most of the rest of the planet, though? They don't really care. And the reason, as with so many things, goes back to history. Back in the first years of television, all Britain had was the BBC from Alexandra Palace. Paid for not by advertising, but by a yearly tax on anyone who owned a television. And that's still true. So advertising wasn't, and isn't, allowed on the BBC. In the United States, though, they had commercial television right from the start -and a -whaa! -a show's host would regularly interrupt their patter to give a personal endorsement down the camera for a better brand of umbrella(!) ""Unless you're smoking L&Ms, all you can do is imagine how good they taste."" But in the UK, that sort of thing was seen as horribly tacky. When commercial TV launched here, admags, weird half-soap-opera, half-infomercials, existed for a few years, but it just wasn't the British way of doing things, darling(!) So in the 60s, strict rules were laid down: advertising and content must never collide. No product placement, at all. Which led to some things that Americans would find very strange: our version of the Price is Right, for example, couldn't mention brand names. You might win a brand new car, but the announcer would never say what make of car it was. ""A 1.3 hatchback!"" Teleshopping and infomercials existed, and still do, but they had to be clearly flagged, on screen with a title, saying what they were. Were there dodgy dealings going on behind the scenes? Did some producers get backhanders for making sure that the heroes of their drama used a certain type of computer? Almost certainly. But you wouldn't see, for example, those heroes stopping for lunch at one particular chain restaurant and emphasising how good the food was. ""This Subway sandwich? So ono."" You know how the American Idol judges all had those big branded cups in front of them? They had to be blurred out when that series was shown over here. Other product placements, like those in movies, or sports broadcasts coming from sponsored arenas, were deemed acceptable, but the regulators generally took a hard line on entertainment made here in Britain. That's what the folks who grew up in Britain are used to. That's what the people making the decisions see as the standard for the country's television. So as you might imagine, our advertising rules in general are a bit more restrictive too. There is a thing called the Advertising Standards Authority who write the Advertising Codes. Now, the codes are technically voluntary, but in practice it's as good as the law. Because few companies want the bad publicity that'll come from breaking it, no TV channels or newspapers will dare to run ads that break the Codes, and ad agencies, the people who make the commercials, don't want to get in trouble either. Because the alternative is the government starts setting the rules instead of the advertising industry itself, and they'll make breaking the Code an actual criminal offence rather than just something that gets your advert pulled. Now, the rules have been relaxed recently. Provided it's flagged up with a tiny symbol at the start of the show, some commercial TV can now include product placements. But for advertisers used to the permissiveness of America, modern-day British TV is still a shock: adverts can't editorially affect the show, and they can't talk about how good the product is. Also, you can't product-place food that's high in sugar, fat or salt, and there's absolutely no product placement at all within children's programs. The Advertising Standards Authority lives in the building behind me, and the Code they write has hundreds of pages of rules governing all sorts of ads. But there are two very important sections for what we're talking about, and given the rules I mentioned earlier, they probably won't surprise you. Number 1: no matter where they are, adverts must be clearly identifiable as adverts. And number 2: you can't advertise unhealthy food to children. So you might see why the regulators got a bit annoyed at vloggers with teen audiences selling cookies in the middle of their regular videos without any warning. Now, to be fair: the regulators hadn't actually produced any help or advice for the industry on this back then, a year and a half ago as I record this. They were caught on the back foot. And the vloggers themselves weren't really expected to know this, it was the ad agency's job -the client that hired them -to check that they were compliant. And the agencies either got carried away at what seemed like this new, unregulated world, or they were American and didn't know or care about it. British TV is still seen, at least by people in Britain, as a gold standard. We don't do those horrible product placements. Not on television, anyway. As for YouTube, and the rest of the internet: well, the rules are still being written. All of which is a long-winded way of saying that my videos are open for product placement now, if you're a company: do get in touch! [Translating this video?

124,The Collapsed Dam That Stopped Los Angeles,"This is the St Francis Dam, outside Los Angeles. Or rather, what's left of it. More than 50 metres high, holding back 100,000 tonnes of water. Until it collapsed catastrophically in 1928, twelve hours after its chief engineer had said that the cracks in it weren't anything to be worried about. The chief engineer in question was William Mulholland. He's one of the reasons that LA is the size and scale it is: Mulholland Drive, home of the stars, is named after him, and his career before the dam collapse was astonishing. He was in charge of projects that diverted a river, and caused what became known as the California Water Wars, as locals tried to dynamite and destroy the infrastructure that was pulling all the water away from their farms. At the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, close to here, as water cascaded down towards the growing city, Mulholland declared to the mayor of Los Angeles: ""there it is, take it"". And they did. Remember, Los Angeles was just one small city among many in the valley at that point -but its charter didn't allow it to provide surplus water to anyone else, so the only way for other cities nearby to get access to this was to give up their independence and become part of LA. And that might have continued, perhaps Burbank, Pasadena, Anaheim, other cities that have separate local government today might all be part of one enormous city... if it wasn't for the St Francis Dam. The leading theory for the collapse is that the foundations were unsound: on solid bedrock, the dam would have been perfectly safe -but it was built on permeable ground, so the weight of water held behind the dam started to seep through and soften the ground under it. There had always been a couple of cracks in the dam; that was normal for the time, concrete can do that as it sets. But more had started to appear, leaks were starting to grow. Mulholland and his assistant inspected the dam, and decided that it needed maintenance, but the situation wasn't desperate. Well, maintenance couldn't have helped: the dam was twelve hours away from collapse. But evacuation of the areas below could have saved hundreds of lives. Just before midnight, it gave way catastrophically. And as the courts of inquiry delivered their verdicts, and as the last standing parts of the dam were demolished and cleared to stop sightseers and people taking grisly souvenirs, the cities that hadn't been eaten up by LA yet: Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, plenty of others -decided that Los Angeles couldn't be trusted with its water projects. They all refused to join, and instead they formed what was called a ""Water District"" with LA -they took joint control of any projects like that in future. The dam collapse didn't just end Mulholland's career: it ended the assimilation of other cities into LA. We might talk about the urban sprawl, everything in the valley, as being Los Angeles, but it's not: it's separate towns and separate goverements, and one of the reasons is this valley and the dam that isn't there any more.

125,Why I Can't Show You The H******** S***,"Welcome to the United States, welcome to Los Angeles, and welcome to the world-famous [BLEEP]. Trademark rights are an interesting thing. You may already know about copyright, about it's been extended in the US and Europe many, many times, and always -strangely enough -just before the early Mickey Mouse cartoons were about to become public domain. But that's copyright, not trademarking. Separately to those cartoons, the name and basic design of Mickey Mouse is also trademarked. It's something that Disney use to sell... well, many, many, many things. So even if those early cartoons were to go out of copyright, I couldn't start selling my own Mickey Mouse merchandise, the same way I can't just set up a store called Wal-Mart or start selling my own drink called Coca-Cola. The rights to the names and designs don't have an expiry date, as long as they're being used and defended. The distinction is about commercial purpose. Which is why I've blurred the [BLEEP] behind me. You already know what it is and what it looks like, it's one of the most recognisable landmarks in America. You can easily find photos and videos of it all over the web, even videos of people climbing it and being chased off by the police. But am I using it for a commercial purpose by making this video about it? I don't think so, I'm using it nominatively, to describe the thing itself, which is legal. But am I willing to risk it when there are lawsuits from the trademark owner and out-of-court settlements going back decades? Now, could I have gotten permission if I'd made a couple of phone calls? Yeah, maybe, but they'd have probably have charged me a fee and wanted me to sign a lot of paperwork, and frankly, I'm on vacation. Am I likely to get sued if I actually show you it? Probably not. But am I absolutely, 100% sure that the trademark owners wouldn't go after me if I showed you one of the most recognisable landmarks in America? And that I wouldn't have to settle out of court or risk the cost of defending a very expensive lawsuit? No. I'm not 100% sure. That's the reason that there's just a blur of pixels behind me. I'm out here in LA for another few days. If any YouTube types want to collaborate on something on November 6th or 7th, send me an email, details are on screen now. I don't have much time but it'd be great to do something, so do get in touch. Oh my god, it's bright out here. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
126,"Risk, Immortality, and the Terrifying Pulpit Rock","I've been thinking a lot about risk recently. Partly because of the new scar on my face, and partly because I'm sitting on Pulpit Rock, in the south of Norway, with nothing between me and a 600 meter drop. It is a very very long way down and it is very windy. But how risky is this, really? I mean, millions of people have visited Pulpit Rock. It's not a difficult hike. Families with kids come up here all the time. And yet, in living memory, only one person has ever fallen off it. Walking up here is probably more dangerous. Driving to the base of it certainly is. And yet this has been called one of the world's scariest tourist attractions. And it is. Humans are bad at assessing risks. That's not news, you know that. But would I still be here, would he still be sitting on the edge, if the consequences were different? Let's say, theoretically, that at some future point humanity has cured all disease, including ageing. No one gets old, no one gets ill. Technically, you are immortal, but you can still get hit by a car, or fall off a very high rock. I did some maths. An average, modern, healthy, western person has about a 1 in 2500 chance of dying from an accident every year. It's a rough estimate. But those odds mean that one in five of those immortals won't live to see 500 years. One in three don't see 1,000. Sure, that's a long life, but it's not immortality. You still die. Transhumanists would say, well, they're able to back up their minds, that all they need to do is ""live long enough to live forever"" â that's Ray Kurzweil. But if that turns out not to be an option, then the only way to survive would be to avoid all risks. Now, in English, we use the word ""live"" not just to mean our bodies working, but to represent experiences like this. It implies that hiding away in a bunker, avoiding risk, is somehow being less alive. But if you really had literal immortality, if you thought you'd survive into eternity, would you live like this, take those actually quite scary 1 in 2500 odds every year, knowing that, at some point, your number will come up? Or do you hide yourself away, never leave a safe bunker, knowing you won't interact with the world, but know you'll grow old with it, you will find out what the future holds? Ultimately: which is more human: the desire to experience, or the desire to survive? I don't know the answer, and I suspect it's somewhere in the middle, because some old part of my brain, with millions of years of evolution guiding it, has already made the decision for me. Because I am sitting on this bit of the rock, and not out there. That is absolutely terrifying. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] OFF SCREEN: Did you enjoy that? Did I enjoy that?

127,"Ships, Mines and Magnetism","Behind me is HMS Defender, one of the new generation of Royal Navy ships. It is an incredible piece of engineering, capable of taking out a small drone at 40km distance, capable of tracking 2,000 targets at once. 'Cos it's a destroyer, and it is meant to defend itself and the rest of the fleet by taking out incoming missiles before they even come close. It is a masterpiece of modern warfare engineering. [MUSIC: Rule Britannia] But like all big ships, it has a design flaw that you really can't get around -as long as you're building something out of steel. If you take that much metal, and put it through a big magnetic field -like, say, the Earth's, as it sails around -then it's going to start picking up magnetism. It's going to start diverting compasses. It's going to start being detected by magnetic mines, which were developed during World War 2 and afterwards to home in on any big source of magnetic signals -like, say, a ship that's been sailing for a while -and detonate next to them. We're talking sea mines here, by the way, not land mines. So how do you defend against that? Well, nowadays you use very complicated degaussing equipment on board a ship. But in the past, you used to drag a 2,000 amp electrical cable down the side, or set up an enormous degaussing coil that is bigger than the ship itself, and -well, do the same thing that you used to do to CRT monitors when you pushed a button and they went 'dong' and distorted for a while. But what if you want to get close to a mine? What if your ship's job is to get rid of mines, and you need to get close enough to spot them without setting them off? Docked just downriver from Tower Bridge is this: HMS Middleton, a Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel. It's a minesweeper, bascially, which means it can tell how many mines are in adjacent grid squares -no, I'm kidding. It seeks out and destroys mines. But it's able to do that without the mines detecting it and detonating it because this is not made of metal. This ship is made of glass-reinforced plastic. It's able to find and destroy mines that are hunting for magnetic things because, well, it's not made of anything magnetic. It's just a plastic boat. Sounds terrible when I put it like that, but well: this class of vessel can do more damage to one specific threat than anything else in the Royal Navy. [Translating these subtitles?

128,7 Illegal Things To Do In A British Election,"We are six weeks away from the UK General Election, which means we are in purdah. Unless it's absolutely critical, the folks in charge, national or local, aren't allowed to announce any new policies, sign any big new contracts, or do anything official that could be seen as trying to use their power to unduly influence the election. Not that most of them will: Parliament has just been dissolved, so they can all go off and campaign. On that note... The rules are complicated and depend on the size of the area you're campaigning in, but from now until election day, each individual candidate can spend no more than about Â£15,000 on all their campaigning. That's not just an advertising budget: that's on everything. Every penny has to be counted, tracked and invoiced, and if you go over, you can be disqualified even after the election. And all the scams and tricks you're currently thinking of to get around that? The law covers most of them with a catch-all clause saying you must make an ""honest assessment"". The political parties also have a limit on their national campaigning budget, which is about twenty million pounds over the whole country. Sounds like a lot, but as a comparison: the last US election cost six billion dollars. But keeping to that isn't as difficult as you might think, because... The UK has never allowed political adverts on television. The parties are given a small amount of free airtime on major channels, but pretty much everyone switches off as soon as they hear the phrase ""Now, a Party Election Broadcast by..."" This year, though, the parties have realised that they can put attack ads on the internet instead, and then use their limited budget to target those ads only at people who live in marginal constituencies -swing states, for the Americans out there. If you live in one of those, you might even have seen one of those ads before this video. So, okay, the parties can't advertise on TV, but surely they've got the pundits on the news arguing for them, right? TV news must be -well, actually fair and balanced. By law. Generally, the BBC gets an equal amount of complaints from all sides, and then they reckon they've done their job about right. Newspapers have no restriction like that, though, and the tabloids have been quite happy to use that influence in the past. I swear that's what it's called. Here's how the scam works: go into a retirement home, and by confidence, collusion, or coercion, get access to either the residents' postal votes, or get nominated as their proxy voter, so you can vote on their behalf. Amazingly, this has only been illegal since 2006. How do you spoil a result? Well, postal votes are sometimes opened for verification days before the polls have closed. There's no reason why not, it won't change the result as long as they're still kept secret. And no-one does anything ridiculous like, oh I don't know, tweet what they've seen. Well done there, actual member of Parliament. She deleted it quickly, admitted it, and was given an official police caution. And finally: Everyone who's stuck posters up, or put some temporary sign up in their garden: they have to make sure they're taken down within two weeks. If it's anything like last time, we may not even have a government in there by then, but at least those of us who live away from Westminster won't be constantly reminded of it.

129,How To Make Something One Atom Thick,"TOM: I am with Kate Oliver and Andy Collins from the Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. And they're going to show me how we see tiny tiny tiny things. KATE: So we're nanotechnologists, and for us, a tiny thing is an atom. TOM: Right. Okay. KATE: So we have one way of seeing atoms. It's called a scanning tunnelling microscope. And it uses the fact that if you bring a tip close to a surface, there's a probability that because of quantum -TOM: I love that explanation. KATE: -the electrons will go from the surface to the tip. So basically, as you move the tip along, if you hit a bump, more electrons will tunnel up into the tip. And that will give you an idea of how close the surface is. TOM: But that means you need a tip that is one atom thick. KATE: It means you need a tip that is very small. TOM: Okay. Which is where you come in. ANDY: So I'm going to show you how to make a tip that's one atom thick. You need to get it as sharp as you possibly can for good imaging. We've got a secret weapon of nanoscience: Pliers. And wire cutters. TOM: I kind of assumed there'd be some kind of hideously expensive equipment required in this, but... ANDY: So I've got some platinum wire. TOM: Okay, that is hideously expensive. ANDY: It's a platinum iridium alloy. And we use platinum so that it doesn't conduct oxygen, which would make the tip fatter. Because we want one single, conductive atom at the surface of the tip. So if I hold that wire in my pliers, and I apply the wire cutters at a 45 degree angle... ..there we go! That means you've got something that, in theory, is atomically sharp. TOM: That's fantastic. So what do you do if it's not conductive? Because quantum tunnelling only works with something that's conductive. KATE: This is an atomic force microscope. TOM: It's really cool! And it's actually scanning at the minute? KATE: It is. You can see on the screen here, that is -20 micrometres across. So that is about a fifth of the width of one of your hairs, Tom. But we wouldn't be able to see anything on here if it wasn't against a really flat, high-contrast background. Luckily, we have a number of minerals that come in convenient flat sheets. One of these is mica, which I have here. But we can't be sure that we've only got one layer on the surface. So for that, we have another high-tech nanoscience tool. TOM: Which is sellotape. KATE: Yes. Adhere this down. And it's stuck to just one of these layers of mica, or maybe a couple. TOM: But the top layers? KATE: Yes. And then: peel it off, and can you see the faint outline? TOM: There is. There is a faint outline of a square on there. Which is -is that just a one atom thick layer of mica? KATE: Yep. And that implies that what's left is also entirely flat. Giving us a really good contrast for any atoms, molecules, species -these are some fibres we've got on top of this surface -that we want to have a look at and see what they can do for us that's really useful. TOM: So we have million-pound equipment  around this lab. And then we've got pliers and sticky tape. ANDY: Yes. TOM: That is wonderful. Kate Oliver, Andy Collins, from the Centre for Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. Thank you very much, guys! [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
130,Turnpikes and Tolls: What if all major roads were private?,"Behind me is the last surviving tollgate in London, on a private road through Dulwich College. Back at the start of the 19th century, almost all the roads out of London were turnpikes, toll roads. And it wasn't just London: across the country, there were hundreds of turnpike trusts, private companies that had a government-approved monopoly on one particular bit of road. They kept it in reasonable condition, at least by the horse-drawn standards of the day, and in exchange they could charge a toll. But travelling across country meant you'd be paying tolls to half a dozen different and possibly-corrupt companies as you went. Heck, just travelling across London you could hit tollgate after tollgate after tollgate. Now, the Turnpike Trusts did some good: the money paid for a decent road network. But they weren't popular: before the turnpikes came along, the roads, although they were frequently rough and difficult to travel on, were free. So there were complaints, and occasional riots, but the turnpikes stood. But then along came the railways. Suddenly anyone who could afford to pay road tolls could also afford a faster and more comfortable option. So both people and freight moved to rail. The turnpike trusts started to collapse, local government took over all the roads, and by the time motorways came along, it was accepted that government collected tax, and then used that tax to build new roads. But what if history had turned out slightly differently? Where would we be if all the roads were still private, if every major route had a toll that went not to government, like the Congestion Charge or modern American turnpikes, but to a private company running it? If every time you drove onto London's Westway, you paid Â£5 to the Westway Corporation sponsored by McDonalds? Well, actually, er, we would be in France. Most of the French autoroutes, the motorways there, are run by private companies, collecting tolls, just like the old days. You don't need to visit some bizarre zeppelin-filled alternate reality to find turnpikes -there are always zeppelins in alternate realities -all you need to do is cross the Channel."
131,How to Program a Quantum Computer (sort of),"TOM: I'm kind of expecting it to be this enormous bit of equipment that's sitting round here somewhere. JACQUES: No, no, you're almost there. It's just in... this cupboard. TOM: This cupboard! JACQUES: So here is... the quantum computer. TOM: That little chip there? JACQUES: In fact, what it really is, is just this -you see the very thin black strip in the middle. That's actually the chip. Most classical computers store information on big macroscopic things. And what we do at the Centre for Quantum Photonics, and what other people are doing around the world, is try to store that information on single particles. Or single atoms. In our case, we're going to do it with photons, particles of light. And then you start inheriting the beautiful rules of quantum physics. TOM: So this is double-slit experiment, this is something that is a particle and a wave at the same time. JACQUES: And if you imagine these -your two slits, and we say, well, a photon going through the top slit is a 0, and a photon going through the bottom slit is a 1, now when we run this experiment we've got the idea that we've got both a 0 and a 1 at the same time. TOM: So by cleverly cancelling out those waves, adding them, you can kind of design an algorithm? JACQUES: ...yeah. This is where it gets a bit tricker. Back in the olden days, when you wanted to build a quantum computer, you needed big things like this. The problem with this is that it gets a bit hot, and we maybe knock something, and it all misaligns. What we do in Bristol is we've been designing and fabricating what we call waveguides. Now waveguides are basically just bits of fibre-optic on chip, on a bit of glass. TOM: Okay. JACQUES: So we can actually manipulate the photons moving through a bit of silicon. TOM: And so by changing how the waveguides act, you can change the photons -the way the photons pass through the system. JACQUES: Exactly. TOM: And that's your programming? That's algorithm design... JACQUES: That's our programming. So we're going to get our bit of glass, and we're going to put a metal piece of conductor on top. And when we apply a voltage, it's going to heat the thing up -it's a heater... TOM: Which changes how the waveguide acts... JACQUES: Yeah! It changes the refractive index. TOM: Which slows the light down. JACQUES: Precisely. TOM: Just a tiny amount but enough to change the interference pattern later on, because we're dealing with the speed of light, the wavelengths involved are tiny tiny tiny... JACQUES: Yes, exactly. TOM: So a tiny bit of heating in the waveguide changes the interference pattern, changes the quantum computer, that's your programming. JACQUES: You got it. You got it! TOM: There is a guy -the person from the university who's just behind the camera, who you can't see in the dark there, is just going ""yes! he got it!"" JACQUES: It's online now. So what you can do is, you can go and play around with a simulation of it, a model, and if you come up with an idea you can then ask to actually use it. TOM: To use that? JACQUES: And to put photons into it and to heat it up in real life. So it's there, for people to use, it's called Quantum in the Cloud. That's what we're getting excited about. TOM: Jacques Carolan is from the Centre for Quantum Photonics at the University of Bristol. Jacques, thank you very much. JACQUES: Thank you very much, Tom."
132,Can It Be Too Cold To Snow?,"There is an old saying that ""it's too cold to snow"". Now a lot of people will say, that's obviously rubbish, it can snow at any temperature. which, okay, is sort of true. Let's rule out some technicalities to start off with. First of all, we are talking about snow made of water here, not the methane snow that you might get on Titan or some other planet. And of course, at cryogenic temperatures the kind of temperatures where oxygen and nitrogen become liquid, it's certainly too cold to snow unless you start having a very strange definition of snow. We are talking about the regular planet Earth, ice water snow, like that's suddenly started falling just here. As air gets colder, it has much less capacity to hold water vapor. It gets saturated far far quicker. That's because when it's cold, the individual water molecules are much more likely to condense into liquid and much less likely to evaporate out into vapour. So cold air is much more likely to have already gotten rid of its water by forming clouds somewhere else over there. So cold air is drier, and therefore it's too cold to snow. But there are a few other factors involved too. The temperature down here while it's quite cold at the minute is not the same as up there. Well, obviously, it's much colder up there. But they don't normally follow each other in lockstep. Just because it's cold and dry down here doesn't mean the ice crystals aren't forming up there in the clouds. And that's if there is any cloud up there, of course. That's the other problem. Let's not forget that snow can only form if there's some cloud to form it in. Clouds are also really good at reflecting the heat from the earth back at the surface. If there's no cloud, sure, there definitely won't be snow, but it's also going to be much colder because the heat isn't trapped below that cloud layer. So the cause and effect is sort of the wrong way round there, but you can see where the old wives' tale comes from. Yes, for those reasons, as the temperature drops further and further and further snow becomes less and less and less likely. There is some truth to the old saying. It can be too cold to snow. It is very cold here right now, though, and I am going back inside. Aagh! It's down the back of my neck! [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
133,"Ley Lines and Avebury Henge, the Better Version of Stonehenge","It's a cold and windy winter solstice, and I'm in one of the best places in the world to celebrate it Avebury henge, in Wiltshire. It's basically Stonehenge's lesser known cousin. And I reckon it's better. If you believe the new agers, then Avebury, this whole siteIt's enourmous by the way, it's many times the size of Stonehenge. Enourmous earthworks, three stone circles. This is the center of a swirl of energy highways, Ley Lines as they're known. In the 1920's a man called Alfred Watkins brought out a book called ""The Old Straight Track"". The idea that there were dead straight tracks running across Britain that ancient peoples would follow. In the 1970's that got mixed up with a whole load of ""New Age"" beliefs. By someone called John Michell. He came up with the idea of Ley Lines. Mystical energy highways that spread across Britain, and presumably the world. Thing is, if you look at the data, if you look at where the Ley Lines actually are, you can see the patterns. You can see points in a line, and the Ley Lines following them. Well... you can. But also if you just put a hundred random dots down on a map, mathematically you can also draw lines between them. You can also find Ley Lines between Woolworths stores, as mathematician Matt Parker did. Or between old red telephone boxes. Since Britain has thousands and thousands of scheduled ancient monuments. But, well this is still a site of great spiritual significance. As I've wandered around there've been a lot of new age pagans around. Some drumming, some just smoking pot, and a couple just kinda putting their heads to the stones. This is why this place is better than Stonehenge. Stonehenge, you can't get close to the stones, except on special days. You certainly can never touch them. But here, well These stones have been torn down and put back up a couple of times by various branches of Christianity and paganism that've come through. Someone has build a villiage in the middle of the standing stones and run a road through it. There are some that've just been replaced with small markers to show where evidence says a stone once was. No one really complains that the Sistine Chapel is restored every now and then. I don't think we should complain that these stones have been restored either. This is a very real way of having some kind of connection to the ancient humans who were here four and a half, maybe five thousand years ago, and who put these stones up for... Well. We'll never know what reason and if that means we get a little bit of new age beliefs... Well, I can't really begrudge that. Happy winter solstice. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
134,"The Hottest Place in Britain, and the BBC Theme Park","I'm on the Swanscombe peninsula, a few miles east of London, on the south bank of the Thames. And this is notable for a couple of reasons I mean, it just looks like a desolate brownfield site and I guess it is. But it's also the warmest point in the UK. Officially. Seriously. I mean, not right now; it's the middle of December, but all the record temperatures that have ever been recorded in the UK, the famous 38Â°C, 101Â°F, that was once recorded came from that weather station behind me. It's an official Met Office weather station. If you have a look online, you'll see that meteorologists are having a bit of a debate about it. Weather stations like that, the official ones, behind a Stevenson screen, as they're called, are meant to filter out any kind of external influence. They're not meant to be in the middle of a microclimate for proper temperature records. Well, there's some debate that this is. It's surrounded by earth on three sides, there's industrial activity, docks, and a sewage plant, all of which could raise the temperature. And, well, there's a Port of London Authority radar next to it, and if you believe the conspiracy theorists online, and say ""They've caught the Met Office in a lie, that radar could be warming up the sensors"" Obviously, it's not, but, nevertheless there's some question as to whether this is actually the warmest site in Gravesend, as it's known. Or, whether they've just put the weather station in a slightly wrong place. But there's something more important about this site. This whole area, this whole peninsula, it doesn't look big on a map but I've just spent a muddy mile and a bit walking here, and yeah... it's big, because this will be the site, if all goes well, of the coming Paramount London theme park, the one that, this week, announced it's signed a deal with the BBC in order to license Top Gear, Doctor Who, and a load of other TV shows. So, in 5-6 years' time, I might be walking down here on a nicely paved path, with people screaming as they ride rollercoasters and laughing as they have a go on the TARDIS. It's going to be quite different in 5 or 6 years' time if it all goes well, and this weather station will probably have to be moved. So, if the temperature in London seems to drop officially in a few years' time, perhaps it has, or, more likely, perhaps they've moved this weather station to make way for The Doctor.

135,The Concrete Pillars On Top Of British Hills: Trig Points,"I'm on top of a hill, and like six thousand other hills and high places across the United Kingdom, this one has one of these on top of it. A short squat pillar, made of concrete, about three feet high. Now why would someone go to the trouble of building six thousand odd 'trig points' as they're known, trigonometric stations, on high points, because getting there is incredibly difficult, you have to lug tools, you have to lug the concrete, and you're building something, by the look of it, that's gonna last for centuries, why would you do that? Well the answer is mapping. In 1936, and continuing for a quarter of a century, Brigadier Martin Hotine, and thousands of people, who worked for the Ordnance Survey, built these pillars, in an attempt to retriangulate Great Britain, and produce the first truly accurate map of the country. See, distance is incredibly hard to measure but angles, angles, you can do precisely. On top of here, you've got some hooks, on which you can set down a 'theodolite', something to measure angles. And then, you build these on hills, so that no matter where you are, if you're at a trig point, you can see at least two other trig points. And if you can do that, and you know High School trigonometry, Then you can take one precise baseline measurement across a heath somewhere, the angles you've measured, and work out the distance across the entire United Kingdom. Nowadays, GPS has taken over of course, they're little more than a landmark for hill-walkers, but nevertheless, these trig points meant that we had a precise map of the United Kingdom, with nothing more than a lot of angles, and a lot of maths.

136,Why Four Score and Seven Years Ago?,"""Four score and seven years ago, ""our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation."" Lincoln's Gettysburg Address doesn't sound quite right in a British accent, I know. But, I'm on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and it seems an appropriate thing to recite. Let's have a talk about those first few words, ""Four score and seven years ago"" It's a weird way of putting ""87"" isn't it? 'Score' is an archaic term for twenty. Why would a great orator choose that, and why does it sound so resonant? Well, the answer goes back to base 20 counting. Vigesimal. Which is used all over the world to this day. There's some European languages who use it, Welsh, traditionally used it. Although decimals have been slipping in lately. There are African languages, American languages that use it all over. And French used it as well. If you ever learn French you will know that 87, the number that Lincoln is talking about, is ""quatre-vingt-sept"". Four twenties, and seven. Four score, and seven. It's resonant because it's a holdover from much older language. It was used in the Bible, not because of translations from older languages, but because it sounds authoritative. It sounds like the word of God. At least, in the versions that still use archaic language. Modern translations will tend not to. So you have this old word that is used to bring up an old sense of 'this is how we used to be'. It's used in speeches. It's used in narration. And it was used, of course, by the great Mr. Lincoln. Something, from Washington DC, that you might not have known. If I say I'm an old mate of Bazza's, do you think they'll let me in? No. No, they... No. [Translating these captions?

137,The Floating Lighthouse in New York: The Lightship Ambrose,"So let's say it is 1908. You need a lighthouse somewhere. But, there aren't any rocks to put it on. There's just dangerous shores and shoals. The solution nowadays would be to build a large tower, anchor it to the sea bed, but 1908? The technology wasn't there, so the result is this:  The Ambrose. This is Mike Weiss, he's the waterfront foreman at the South Street Seaport Museum. Tell me about the Ambrose. -It's a floating lighthouse. This ship is a lightouse. So she'd sit out in the channel, twelve crew at a time, all weathers that came through. In the middle of winter, it was freezing cold, snow on deck or it's hurricane season, or there's massive waves coming through, storms, heavy fog... -And she has to stay there with the light on,  no matter what? -Yes, she must hold her place,  she must keep her station. -So there's a heck of an anchor on this thing, presumably? -Yes, she's fitted with two mushroom anchors. She'd use one at a time unless things got really bad, I'd imagine, but they're each 5000lbs. [~2200kg] It sat there in the channel, and ships would aim for it, now that isn't always a good thing, though  -I was going to say, that sounds dangerous! -You're sort of a sitting duck sometimes. -Yeah, because a lighthouse is on rocks, you'll hit the rocks... -Right so you'd aim for this area near the lighthouse. But, here, ships sometimes, especially in fog, there's always the very serious risk that they will run into the lightship that was at station there. -So this ship saved lives? In a time where you couldn't put a lighthouse down, you couldn't put anything solid  to the seabed, there wasn't the technology, This ship saved lives? -Oh, without question, absolutely saved lives. -So the lightship Ambrose, one of very few lightships remaining in the United States, and in the world. Something that not just saved lives, but made this port city possible. Something you might not have known. Thank you very much to the  South Street Seaport Museum Their staff and volunteers are preserving a load of historic ships if you're visiting New York  do stop by, and if you're living in New York,  they could always use some volunteers.

138,The Liquid Nitrogen Tanks of New York,"The Avenue of the Americas! One of the most important streets in New York. Over there is the famous Radio City Music Hall. And over there are two canisters of liquid nitrogen, sitting entirely undefended on the street. And yes, that sounds a little bit odd There are plenty of folks walking by and wondering ""should those be there?"" And, plenty more folks walking by and not noticing them at all. So it seems strange, and I looked it up And it turns out, they belong to one of the phone companies See there's a lot of steam, and water, underground in New York From municipal heating systems, and water pipes, and all sorts of things And those phone wires can get very very wet and, well, fall apart Every three days, someone from the phone company comes around here, replaces those canisters of liquid nitrogen with new ones, and that nitrogen is constantly vented through the tunnels that contain the phone wires in order to keep them dry, and away from oxygen and moistness. The coldness is just a side-effect of how you need to store that much nitrogen. And, well, it seems unsafe, doesn't it? But, I looked it up, and there have apparently never been any incidents with it, and in the event that one of the many, many vehicles on this busy, busy road crashes into them, apparently it'd just cause a little bit of venting and outgassing. It seems strange, but there are many things in every city that seem strange, and liquid nitrogen on the streets is one of the minor ones. Welcome to New York. [Translating these subtitles?

139,The Diner Where You Microwaved Your Own Food,"I'm on 50th Street in Manhattan and behind me, underneath that scaffolding is Tad's Broiled Steaks, one of the first fast food restaurants. I mean, it wasn't quite what we recognize today. It's more of a cafeteria. But the idea that you went in and you ordered from a very limited menu with limited options, and it was cheap: that was the brainchild of the Townsend family and Tad's Broiled Steaks. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. What I'm here to talk about is a slightly less successful idea they had in the 1960s. Here, on the first block of East 42nd Street, about where that McDonald's is now, they opened Tad's Varieties. Now, there isn't much of a record of this. The only contemporary article I could find was in the New Yorker in 1963, which explained the concept. You would go in, pick a frozen meal that's been made earlier that day or earlier that week, take it to a microwave oven on your own table and heat it yourself. And, well, that's an astonishing idea that was going to change the world. In fact, the guy who opened the restaurant said that in the future, there would be only two types of restaurants: Fancy, upscale ones where someone else did the cooking, and cafeterias like that one, where you went in, picked your frozen meal and set it up in your own microwave oven. And he was nearly right. But not quite. He failed to predict home microwaves and the ready-meals, and the TV dinners that actually went on to change the world. And the restaurant closed down soon after, but Ray Kroc, the guy who started McDonald's, he took advice from the Townsend family. That McDonald's over there is, in some ways, a descendant of a restaurant that might not have worked out itself, but still left a bit of a mark on history. Who knows, if history had turned out slightly differently, perhaps there'd be microwave cafeterias all over the world. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"

Remember this plaque -It's going to be important in a minute -because what this plaque and its counterpart commemorate is the fact there is very literally, a bit of this city in New York. Same plaque, different location, here at Waterside Plaza in New York. See, here, on the East River, is a lot of landfill. Originally this whole section was a bit further away from the water, but in World War II, American supply ships went to Bristol, found that it was almost completely bombed out and, well, they needed something to help weigh them down on the way back across the Atlantic, so they literately took the rubble -the stone, the brick of bombed out Bristol â loaded it onto their ships, took it back here, and then just dumped it in the East River. This little bump on the map, right here â this entire housing development which has the same 60's and 70's square brick architecture as Bristol because they were built at the same time â this development here, and for a few streets either way, is literally built on the rubble of Bristol.

141,What Did Witches Actually Use?,"""Eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat, and tongue of dog."" Those are four of the ingredients used by the witches in Shakespeare's ... Scottish play. See, the thing is, I am currently very much on the stage, on a set, here at the Warner Brothers Studio tour. This is the potions classroom from Harry Potter. and well, it's considered extremely bad luck to use 'that word', 'that name', on an actual set. It is said that Shakespeare used an actual witches brew and witches suitably angered by that placed a curse on the play, or on him or, if you believe it, on anyone who said that word. and the result is that saying ""M...th"" here, is considered a very bad idea but did you ever think about that. That doesn't really make sense I mean, not the curse part. That obviously doesn't make sense but the fact that witches would use eye of newt. Witches, the cunning folk, as they were called, the herbalists. They didn't get newts and cut out bits of their eyes and put them in a potion. That doesn't make any sense. Actually, they used herbs and botanicals, and that's what ""eye of newt"" actually was. ""Eye of newt"" is just a code word for something much more innocuous. and there are any number of reasons why that might have been. The true reason is lost to history It could have been a code word, designed to keep magic within the... well, the ""magic circle"". Or it might just have been a dialectal thing, we don't know but what we do know, ""eye of newt"" was actually just mustard seed, something warm and calming to add to a healing broth, something you might not have known. STUPIFY! EXPELLIARMUS! ...amateurs. I'm currently at the Harry Potter Studios tour and this is most definitely a sound stage, which means it would be very bad luck... for me to say... the ...hi."
142,"The Man Who Set Up His Own Toll Road, Without Permission","The road behind me is closed. There's been a landslip. And that's a problem because it's pretty much the only road that connects the villages of Kelston and a dozen others besides to the picturesque city of Bath. There is a detour, but it's 14 miles long, and the council won't be able to open this road for a few months yet. But there is a solution, and it's quite an astonishing one. This is the Kelston toll road, and it was set up not by the council, but by well this man. MIKE: We were in the local pub one night after the road had been closed about 3 months. We were talking to the local farmer who owns the land here. My wife suggested that he should put down some stone and maybe set up a toll road and charge people to go over. We were gung-ho. We carved the field. We built the road. We did it without planning permission. TOM: As you might expect, the council are not initially happy about this, but here's the thing: Mike is not breaking the law. In the U.K., not getting planning permission the U.S. translation would be violating zoning laws but in the U.K., not getting planning permission is not a crime in itself. You're only breaking the law when the council notices, files an enforcement order against you, and then you refuse to undo what you've done. MIKE: So we thought that they would say, ""well look, you know, get on and do it, this is great, you've got our full support."" They they didn't come up with that and they've actually made us apply for retrospective planning permission. TOM: The council did have some good reasons. According to their statement, they weren't sure if construction and driving up there would affect the landslip down there. But, they seem to have taken the risk, and it's paid off. Mind you, they're not the only ones taking a fairly big risk on this road. MIKE: My wife and I have got a lovely little cottage in Kelston down by the river. We put our house up as a guarantee with the road builders to say, ""look, we want to build this road. If it doesn't work out, we will sell our house and we'll pay you, and it's the only way we can make this happen. They're a local firm and they agreed to it. We shook hands and they sent 3 guys over and they built this road in 10 days. We've got to get 150,000 cars over to get our money back but we're well on the way, we've had 100,000. The public's reaction has been [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] it has been astonishing. The public's reaction has been astonishing. TOM: It's even made it onto Google Maps. So there you go.

143,Why Britain Uses Separate Hot and Cold Taps,"The mixer tap, brilliant invention, and yet something that seems to have passed Britain by. You'll get Americans coming over here and asking why our taps look like they're from the 1940's. And even here, in my parents' bathroom -I'm visiting my folks this weekend and they just had a new bathroom put in -separate hot and cold taps. And there are all sorts of theories about why that might be, generally revolving around 'Well we're British,' and 'Stiff upper lip,' and 'You know we don't need mixer taps. We've never had them.' And well, that's partly true, but it also goes back to how houses in Britain were constructed after World War II. In most old British houses there's a cold water storage tank up in the attic. It's reasonably sized, about 250 liters, and that in turn feeds a hot water storage tank that's for the central heating, and for hot water in the bathroom, and in the kitchen, and so on. But the trouble is that might not be entirely safe drinking water. Because that cold water storage tank, in some houses that weren't properly maintained, might have been open to the elements, or silted up, or covered with iron rust, or, in one particular case you can read about, have a couple of dead rats floating in it. That water might technically not be drinkable. And under the regulations I looked up the regulations it is not counted as drinking water. The cold, meanwhile, at least certainly in the kitchen, and sometimes the bathroom, too, the cold water comes straight from the mains. That counts as drinkable. So here's the thing: You have cold, safe, the regulations call it 'wholesome', drinking water, and you have, well, almost certainly safe but not technically, not legally under the regulations, hot water. And never the twain shall meet. If you have a mixer tap, then technically, the unsafe hot water, in the worst case scenario, when there is a backwash valve failure and the mains turns off, that unsafe water could go back, backwash through all the systems, and go out to contaminate the rest of the street or the rest of the water system. That's not legal, therefor no mixer tap. You don't cross the streams. Nowadays, of course, it's a little bit different. This house had its hot water tank ripped out a few months ago. The attic is now just a big empty space again. And, well, there is a very modern, shiny bit of technology downstairs that heats up water on demand. All new built houses go this way. If they've got mixer taps, it'll be absolutely fine. But... I remember being told as a kid 'never drink from the hot water tap.' And that stuck with me. Even now, if there is a mixer tap and I want to drink from it, I will run the cold water for a few seconds just to make sure anything that's unsafe has come out of it. Even now old habits die hard. And sometimes these things just feel a bit safer. [Translating this video? Add your name here if you'd like credit!]"

And you do absolutely nothing? Well, I'll do ever so...  but I'm not actually going to snap your neck(!) It goes without saying that if you do this with someone you don't trust implicitly to do stage fighting... It's dangerous. Be careful. Norm, what are you going to do? First thing I'm going to do is put my hand on your chin. Okay. And then adopt a ""I'm going to snap your neck"" pose. Yep. And then I'm just going to slightly pressure your chin. Not enough to cause your face to move but so that you know my hand is there. And when you're ready, snap your own neck. Okay. What, just as far as I can go? Yeah. And obviously, try and sell the ""huaaah!"" Okay. And kind of a [choking] noise? -Yeah. -Okay. ... ... ... I'm over there... I hope that looked good! I don't know why I'm doing this. It doesn't hurt! I'm instinctively going like this! If it does hurt, I'm really sorry. It's not supposed to! And that is how you break someone's neck on stage.

145,Ultrasonically Vaporized Vodka!,"All this weekend, I'm at Electromagnetic Field, the enormous hacker camp in the middle of the UK. And this is the first thing I didn't know that I found out here. I'm with Toby Jackson from Nottingham Hackspace and his marvelous booze fogger. What on Earth is this? This is my contribution to the BarBot project, which is kind of being built behind you. Basically, a device for turning alcohol and spirits into a rather nice inhalable mist. It's not a complicated device. It's mostly pretty work in a nice suitcase, but deep inside it with my wonderful wiring is two glass tubes which have inside two ultrasonic foggers which have a little brass plate that vibrates ultrasonically, which just smashes whatever liquid is in there to tiny, tiny droplets, which then float. You can buy them off the Internet. You want the ones that cost about Â£20. It's a heavier-than-air mist, so we have this little air pump which just goes in there and ensures that, in proper mad scientist fashion, you get this rather nice effect. And it's swirling over the top. So, basically, it's to look pretty and to be fun. Does it get people drunk? It makes drunk people think they're drunk. In a column  of this, you get about two or three teaspoonfuls of booze Take the lid off and you can inhale it in, as I just did, and you get a bit of a head rush. And you get it here in the back of your throat. Once you've got a few drinks in you, it'll make you go, ""Ooh, hello,"" and be a little bit drunker than you were beforehand. So, it's relatively safe, but it just feels like it's a lot more of aYou said ""relatively safe""? Yeah, you are inhaling alcohol -you're inhaling droplets of vodka into your lungs. That's kind of a bad idea. But many fun things are bad ideas. So if you start putting your face mask on this sort of thing, and inhaling, inhaling, inhaling, that's going to mess you up because basically, if you drink too much, you throw up, and, you know, have a bad time. If you inhale too much, you can't breathe it back out. You can't throw it up. There's no body safety mechanism. Your body's not designed to go, ""Oh yeah, I can throw this stuff up."" It just goes, ""Oh god, I've-.."" and then, you know, liver poisoning. It's not a very good idea in the first place, but if you're under 18, it's illegal. C'mon kids, play safe.

146,YouTube Doesn't Know Your Password,"Youtube doesn't know your password. Neither does Facebook, or Twitter, or any decent web service, literally. Your password is not stored in their database. It's safer that way. A hacker or a rogue employee can't find out what your password is. So, how do they know that you've typed the right password in when you go back to log in? Well, there are certain types of maths operations that are really easy to do one way, but really difficult to reverse. Multiplying two prime numbers together is relatively easy: 17Ã11 is 187. There's a shortcut I used there: to multiply by 11, you times by 10 and then add the original number. Now, because these two were prime, these are the only two numbers you can multiple together to get 187. So let's ask the question the other way: What two prime numbers multiplied together get you similar, semi-prime number? Let's pick 299. Well OK, it can't be 2Ã something,  because it doesn't end in an even number. It can't be 3Ã something, because the digits don't sum to a multiple of 3. It can't be 5Ã something,  because it doesn't end in 5 or 0. Can it be 7? Well, I don't know, I have to work that out the long way and there are so many other numbers it could be. There are a few shortcuts that computers and good mathematicians can use to make the operation a bit faster but, in summary, particularity for huge numbers, there is no efficient way to reverse that operation. It is maths that is easy to do one way, and difficult to reverse. Now to you, your password is a string of letters, or symbols, or numbers but to a computer it is the same as everything else a string of binary digits ones and zeros, and you can do maths on those ones and zeros, you can do those one way operations. Not necessarily anything to do with prime numbers, although there sometimes is. That process is called hashing, and there's something called salting that makes it more complicated still, but basically what you have at the end: you type in your password when you register -""abc"" -you put it through a process,  what you get is a random string of characters. That's what they keep in their database, and when you type your password in again to log in they put it through the same mathematical one way operation. If the hash that comes out matches what they have in their database then they know what you entered was right, even though they don't know anymore what you actually typed in. And if they've done it right, you can't reverse that hash back to your password without centuries of computer time or billions of dollars. That's why Google, Facebook, Yahoo, everyone, they don't email your password when you say you've forgotten it, they ask you to set a new one. They can't email you. They don't know it. And for that reason, if you ever find a company that does email you your password when you say that you've forgotten it, well, run, because they have no idea about security. If that was interesting, I've done a couple of longer videos over at Computerphile about hashing and password security and if it wasn't, well â The stunts you are about to see were performed by trained drivers on a closed course. Do not try this at home. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here if you'd like credit!]"
147,Gravity Doesn't Always Point Straight To The Earth's Core,"Last time I did a video about gravity... I was trying to get across that gravity changes depending on where on earth you are. For a few reasons, including the earth not being a sphere and what I forgot, was the composition of rocks, but... What you might not know is that gravity doesn't always point straight down towards Earth. If you're next to a massive mountain, something on the scale of Mount Everest, then the mountain will exert its own gravitational pull, which means that the forces add and-Oh boy!-The forces add... Here we go! Which means... Oh, this is bad, this is scary. Oh boy! Which means that gravity sometimes doesn't point straight down. Oh boy. There's a sign... Today's lesson is that when it says ""slow down"", it really does mean ""slow down"". You can come off on an alpine slide! Don't believe the people who say, that you can go down without brakes. Don't believe someone who says, this isn't actually terrifying and that you don't need to slow down around the corners. You do! And if you don't it hurts! Never mind gravity. THAT is something you might not have known. Injury count: Road rash in four places, hands stung with nettles, and significant damage to my pride. Chris and Matt, they got down just fine. So like I was saying, gravity doesn't always point down, but remember that it does. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] . . . Wicked!"
148,What's The Longest Word In The English Language?,"This is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. The longest place name in the UK And it took me two weeks to learn that And that's what word nerds do; we learn long words because it's interesting, we learn that okay, the longest word, technically, in the English language is about 100,000 characters long. But it's the name of a compound, so it doesn't really count We learn that the longest word in any major dictionary is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. But that doesn't really count because it's technical So then, we learn that the longest non-technical word in any major dictionary is floccinaucinihilipilification. But that doesn't really count because it was coined because it was intended to be a long word it means ""being meaningless"", which is kind of ironic. Deliberately So, then we learn that the longest non-technical non-coined word in the English language is antidisestablishmentarianism. But that doesn't really come up in everyday speech Language doesn't generally support, at least, the English language doesn't generally support, long words. Because they're inconvenient, because they're unwieldy, because they slow everyone down. We shortened ""internet"" to ""net"", for crying out loud, because three syllables was too much. This isn't a real place name this isn't what anyone calls this place it was a publicity stunt from Victorian times Even years later, here I am reciting that name to you because it's now a tourist destination. Long words are there because they're interesting, not because anyone actually uses them in speech. Longest word I use: internationalisation, which is a term in technology. That is an unhelpful 20 characters long and that's long enough that it gets abbreviated to i18n when it gets written down. Not really impressive, not difficult to say, not something you need to memorise. But that's how language works If it's inconvenient, we shorten it This could never have arisen by anything other than a publicity stunt. Something you might not have known.

150,Why Do Flag Emoji Count As Two Characters?,"Let's say your team has just won a World Cup match. Unlikely if you're English, I know. But let's say you're French, and you've just stormed it against the Swiss and you're feeling patriotic. You open up your phone, you go to your Twitter client. It gives you 140 characters, and the first thing you do is sweep through the keyboard. Sweep through the emoji on your phone, until you find the French flag. And then you hit the button, and it promptly gives you a nice little wavy flag here. The other advantage of the French flag of course, very easy to draw compared to the British one. There we go. But as soon as you do that, just one flag has gone in and your character count goes down to 138, right away. Why does that happen? You've only put one flag in there. And there are much more complicated characters you can put in -emojis in general, are really long in terms of binary representation. But they only count as one character. Typing in ""a"" -one character. Typing in a really complicated ""emoji-smiley-face-thing"" -one character. So why is the flag two? Well, the reason for that is down to the Unicode Consortium. They're the people who decide what goes into Unicode, they're the reason you have 250 new emojis just gone in. But they didn't want to put flags in Unicode, because flags change really often. In the last decade, there have been new countries added. There have been countries that have changed from military coup, or civilian uprising and have changed their flag. And Unicode does not want to have to deal with that. So instead, they created something called regional indicator symbols. Oh yeah, I can totally write on a whiteboard. There we go, regional indicator symbols. And what they are, are characters that are simply A through Z with dots around. That's the official representation. And what that button is doing, what that French flag button is doing is it is not typing in a French flag. It's typing in, in reality, behind the scenes, anything that doesn't have a French flag will see... an F and an R FR It's the code for France. You get .fr domain names. That code is what anything that doesn't support that French flag sees. The IPhone does support it. Android in most cases does support it. Modern versions of Windows, I think, still support it. It takes those two characters and goes: ""Ah, you mean the French flag."" Puts them together, lies to you, shows you just one character. But the character count doesn't lie. 'cause Twitter sees those as two characters because well they are, counts them as two Your rate goes down. So, there you go. Two, characters combined one making the French flag. Simple as that. That is why it takes two characters to do an emoji flag and not one. And if that was vaguely interesting then I've got a much longer video about what counts a character in my Language Files series. And soon there'll be an upload from Computerphile about emojis and their history just here. In the mean time, that's why it's two characters for a flag and that is something you might not have known. This really isn't coming off. Is this not whiteboard paint? This is just a wall. I have just drawn on the wall. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
151,The Equation of Time: Clocks Vs Sundials,"I am squinting into the sun at the sundial at the Olympic Park and this is a gorgeously designed sundial. Because not only is the user the gnomon, the post for the sundial, so my shadow is reading 11 o'clock and that is pretty much accurate, it also has GMT and BST so the summer months still have the correct time. And it has the equation of time built into it. Now the equation of time, the name sounds like pseudo-scientific rubbish, but it isn't. It's an equation in the old fashion sense of ""to make equal"". See, there are two different types of time, if you like. There is solar time, that is, the time that means that noon is when the sun is highest in the sky. And then, there is mean time. Clock time, a kind of averaged, ideal time where noon falls reliably every twenty-four hours. And, well, there is a distinction between the two. Because look down at my feet, June is now so I am standing here. Were it March or September, I'd be standing here. And that is because the sun would be in a different position in the sky. It would be lower. Because a) The Earth is tilted because of the seasons. B) earth orbit is an ellipse not a circle. So I'd be standing here, the sun would be in a different position, but my shadow would still read 11. And if it were January or December in the depths of winter, I'd be standing here, and my shadow would still beWell actually, the olympic stadium would be covering up the sun. So my shadow wouldn't be anywhere. But were there theoretically a shadow, it would still hit 11. And the interesting thing about that is that sundials have only been fitted with this in the last couple of centuries. You see, it used to be that sundials were *the* accurate record of time. When the sundial said it was noon the sun was the highest in the sky, and it was noon. No matter the time of year. And then along came reliable clocks and later the railways and telecommunication. The requirement for different bits of the country to be on the same time, to have the same noon. So it went from sundials being accurate and mechanical clocks always being a little bit out... to mechanical clocks being accurate and sundials always being a little bit out. And you can find from a few centuries ago, things called equation clocks. Perfectly accurate clocks, reliable 24 hours in a day clocks, more or less. That would deliberately change their time either by a complicated clockwork mechanism or by the user changing something. So that they were acurate to the sundials and not the other way round Because sunrise in the east could be 20 minutes, 25 minutes ahead of sunrise in the west of Britain. So there you go: the equation of time. It's a thing that means sundials aren't accurate anymore, even though once upon a time they always were. Something you might not have known.

152,"How Do You Make Something Last 1,000 Years?","How do you make something last a thousand years? Because that is a long period of time there are very few human endeavors that have lasted a millennium. The buildings behind me aren't designed to last  that long a century perhaps before they're razed and redeveloped with something else. The Great Pyramid of Giza, that's lasted an incredibly long time. There are universities who can trace back nearly a thousand years. There's a construction company in Japan that started in 578 A.D. and went into liquidation a few years ago. But if you have a project that wants to last that long, well, you're not going to be alive to see it through. I mean, we can hope that life extension technologies will come along but right now, humans don't live much past a hundred years. So what do you do if your project requires a thousand? Well, behind me is Longplayer, inside Trinity Buoy Wharf Lighthouse, here in London. Longplayer is a music composition for singing bowls, designed to last one thousand years from the start of 2000 to the end of 2999. And that is an incredibly long time. In order for that to work, it doesn't have to be a person that sees it through, it has to be a corporation. In this case a non-profit, a charity something called the Longplayer Trust, whose job it is to keep the composition going. Right now it's being synthesized by a computer. There's a large instrument in there that is in the process of being completed. And the trust's job is this: â¢ Update the computer when it needs updating, â¢ Port the software to another language when it needs porting, â¢ Find replacements for the people on the Longplayer Trust board when they need replacing, so that, in nine-hundred and eighty-something years, whether it's here, or somewhere else, or if the sea levels rise: another city or country entirely, you will still be able to hear Longplayer somewhere in the world. That is how you make something last a thousand years. You use many people, and an entity designed to last that long which is: a corporation. Which is something, you might not have known.

153,Fail-Safe vs. Fail-Deadly (with Colin Furze),"I'm with Colin Furze. That's me. Dangling upside down with magnetic shoes that he's made. Colin, do you want to explain how these work? Basically, we've got a microwave transformer, you cut it in half, take one of the coils out, and you end up with this, like a little E-shaped block, whack a car battery on it, and you've got a super strong electromagnet which if you then put in some shoes, you can make magnet shoes! Which are great aren't they Tom! They are! Surprisingly physically demanding, this. Um, but let's talk about fail-safes. Because, well, these electromagnets can be used in a lot of things they're used in the doors in the office I work, and those doors are fail-SAFE. Fail-safe does not mean we have a backup, fail-safe means they fail, and it is safe. You see if the power fails, if there's an emergency, something like that, then everything's fine, the doors unlock automatically because there's no power, and everyone can get out. There is an opposite to fail-safe, which is fail-deadly, and you usually find that in things like nuclear submarines, who have orders to fire if everything falls to pieces. These shoes? Well they may not be fail-deadly, but they're certainly fail-unsafe, because if the electromagnets fail, or if the battery fails or if I, accidentally, push one of these shiny red buttons here, well, then I fall to the ground, neck first, swiftly followed by the incredibly heavy magnetic shoes which, will probably kick me in the face. So with all due respect to your invention Colin, which is marvelous, can I come down now? Yep. You're looking as red as your t-shirt. Oh my God it takes so much out of you, this does! That's wonderful. There you go. Colin's channel is on screen now, he has all sorts of wonderful things like a jet powered bicycle, and world-record attempts. Thank you very much! It's all right. That, was take 4, and I am not doing that again. You really appreciate gravity now don't you? Thanks Colin. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
154,The Nuclear Reactor In The Middle Of London,"This is the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. The World Heritage listed site that most Americans and let's be honest, most Brits, know as  ""that place that got blown up in Thor 2"". But that blowing up would have been a heck of a lot different if it'd happened a couple of decades earlier. See for many years this was a working Royal Navy training base. That's why it's got the name: ""Old Royal Naval College"" That's not centuries ago. There were sailors being trained here up until the mid 90s. And, well, the Royal Navy has nuclear submarines. Nuclear submarines have nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors need people to run them and so what do you do, if you are the Royal Navy and you need sailors to run your nuclear reactors? Well, you build a nuclear reactor in the basement of a 17th century building just miles from the centre of London. Seriously, right here, somewhere in this complex, somewhere in the  basement of this, the King William building, there was a working nuclear reactor for many years, from 1963 to the mid 90's. At the time when Greenwich called itself a nuclear free zone. This area was specifically exempted. And, why was there no outcry? Well, first of all not many people knew about it. The Royal Navy is quite good at operational security and secondly, well, despite the words ""nuclear reactor"" being quite scary it was only a tiny reactor. It produced 10 kilowatts that's enough to power about five electric kettles. I mean the amount of fuel and waste it produced are actually pretty tiny. There would never have been a Chernobyl here. But, well if Thor  had invaded a couple of... I don't know what Thor did, I-I haven't seen the movie. If Thor would have invaded a couple of  decades earlier, who knows? There might have been a bit more  radioactivity, to power his hammerI-like I said, I haven't seen the movie, I don't know what happened. This is the first videos powered by the things you sent in. Thank you very much David and Olly who tipped me off about the reactor in the middle of Greenwich. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
155,The Most Ridiculous Game Of Football In History,"I'm about to play Bubble Football which, let's be honest, is possibly one of the most ridiculous games of football it's possible to play but is it not the most ridiculous game of football in history. That goes to 1994 and the Carribean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada. When [WHISTLE] oh blimey -Barbados went into that match -aaugh! You know what?, I'm gonna tell this story later! The 1994 Carribean cup. It is Barbados vs. Grenada. Barbados need to win by two clear goals in order to qualify, just winning isn't good enough. So, in they go. By halfway through the match they're up 2-0, but, with just seven minutes left Grenada pull one back and it is 2-1. Which means Barbados, despite winning the match, ain't going through, they haven't won by two clear goals. Now, there is a stupid rule in this particular tournament, that if a match is drawn, it goes to extra time, overtime as the Americans would call it, and then ends on the first goal, which counts double, which counts for two. So Barbados realise, hold on, we're 2-1 down, if we just score an own goal, equalise the score, we're gonna have half an hour of extra time in which we just need to score one goal to go through because of this stupid doubling rule. So they do. They tap it back and forth and then ... own goal, in their own net. 2-2. And then, with just three minutes left, Grenada realise, hold on, they need to win by two goals! It doesn't matter whether the score is 3-2 or 2-3, we'll go through either way, as long as we score somewhere! So, with three minutes, Grenada are desperately trying to score either a goal or an own goal, because both will let them through. And they don't manage it. It goes to extra time, Barbados score the golden goal and Barbados go through. And the moral of the story is this: If you want to avoid ridiculous games of football, or any kind of game, if you're changing the rules, make sure you test them thoroughly first for what economists call ""perverse incentives"". And if you want a ridiculous game of football then I thoroughly recommend that. Just remember to wear contacts. That hurt(!) That ... believe it or not, is something from the world of sport -which I don't think I've covered before -that you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
156,Angels Are Actually Pretty Terrifying,"That is the Angel of the North Antony Gormley's incredible sculpture that stands as one of the icons of modern Britain. But angels aren't all like that at least not in Christian philosophy. Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and I'm probably mispronouncing that, and no, that wasn't the name he went by then was a Christian writer in the fifth and sixth centuries and he, along with Thomas Aquinas, settled on the modern Christian hierarchy of angels. And my word if you wanted terrifying creatures you need look no further than angels because yes, the ones in the lower orders, they look vaguely humanoid, as the term would be now: but up at the top you have the cherubim. And they're not cherubs in the sense of angelic little children with serene expressions, no. They have four heads a man, a lion, an eagle and an ox. And then you have the thrones they don't look like that gorgeous thing they look like a wheel within a wheel, covered in eyes. Seriously, if you wanted terrifying creatures from science fiction, it turns out that you can just go and look at some angels. This angel on the other hand is a lot prettier, a lot nicer, and frankly, even though I'm not religious, this is a greater testament to God's work than any wheel, within a wheel with eyes on it. From the Angel of the North, that is something you might not have known. One more thing before I go thank you very much to everyone who replied to my call for help a couple of days ago I got an order of magnitude more answers than I thought I would You're all amazing, thank you so much and I'm sorry if I didn't get to your comment I did the best I could. Oh and one more thing if you want a bonus fact There's as much of that angel below the ground as there is above. 20 meters or so down to the bedrock. Otherwise? Well, the wind might just make it fly away. [Subtitles by Paul Pollard. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
157,The Early Steam Train With No Brakes: Stephenson's Rocket,"Tom: I'm on a train, with no brakes, going backwards. And not just any train, this is Stephenson's Rocket, which was built in-when was it, Chris? Chris: 1829. --1829.  Well it's not the original, that's in the Science Museum. This is a replica from 150 years later, that is in the National Railway Museum in York, but for all intents and purposes this is Stephanson's Rocket and it has no brakes. Chris, tell them why, tell them something they might now know(!) Okay. When this was built, proper brakes really hadn't been invented, you had an handbrake for when you were stood still, and we also on this loco have modern brakes, because that's the law! But we try not to use them, we try to be authentic. So, the way we'll brake is literally-well we're going backwards at the moment-so we'll stick it in forwards gear. That will put steam into the cylinders on the opposite side and bring us gradually to a nice slow halt, then we'll just saunter off in the opposite direction. Now, it seems like that would damage it, it seems like because on a regular gear box when you hit that and put it-there we go-into reverse, it feels like that should mesh the gears wrongly, but that's not what's happening here, it's just injecting steam the other way. That's exactly right. The cylinder moves backwards and forwards like this. We just put the steam into the direction that the cylinder wants to move. It tries to compress the steam and that resistance slows the loco down. And so we comes steadily to a stop, like here, and then once we hit that, it just starts going the other way. Hopefully! That is wonderful! That is how you stop Stephenson's Rocket, that is a train with no brakes and that-thank you to Chris, Charlie and the National Railway Museum-is something you might not have known!

158,"The Three Types of Twilight, and The Days Without Night","I'm on the 19th floor of One Canada Square in London and that is a GORGEOUS sunset . And soon the sun will dip below the horizon and it will be twilight. See, night doesn't technically start-at least under formal definitions -until the sun is 18Â° below the horizon. And until then, there are three types of twilight: First of all there is civil twilight, that's when the sky is still fairly light and you can walk about without worrying you're going to trip over something, that's 0Â° to 6Â° below the horizon. Next up is nautical twilight, that's when you can just about see the horizon against the sky if you're navigating on a boat, that's 6Â° to 12Â°. And finally there is astronomical twilight, where it's still just a little bit too light for the really faint objects like nebulae and galaxies to come out in the sky, that: 12Â° to 18Â°. And then finally, when the sun tips under that, then it formally becomes night. But the thing is in midsummer, when it's really really bright, when it's the sun, high in the sky the United Kingdom is north enough, that it never becomes night, that from evening to morning we are perpetually in twilight, until finally Autumn rolls around and we dip into night once again. America doesn't quite get it, Vancouver in Canada just stretches into that definition, but the whole of the UK, and of course a lot of northern Europe, well, we have entire seasons when we never ever technically have night. That is twilight, that is a really gorgeous sunset and that is something you might not have known. [Closed captions by MM Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
159,The Rise and Fall of the Gasometer,"Those big round things behind me are gasometers Or at least they were, now they're deactivated, disused, and awaiting demolition. But there used to be one or more of these in every town and every city up and down Britain. This was when gas was not a thing piped in from the North Sea and beyond but instead something that was made in a gasworks by burning coal and that gas would be stored inside these Now that blue one is a bit special, it had a piston that would go up and down inside depending on how much gas needed to be stored. But those scaffolding ones there they are currently empty and so the tank is down in the ground But it would telescope up be pushed up by the pressure of the gas inside it in order to store however much needed to be in there. And they would rise and fall throughout the day, the gas works would spend day and night generating gas steadily the gasometer would rise And then, in the evening as people turned on most of their cookers, but perhaps their heating as well that gas would be pushed out of it, and it would steadily fall down to the ground. But now, well, they're not needed any more because that's a really inefficient way to store gas with modern technology, all the gas that would be in there can be stored in a 50 meter stretch of high pressure pipeline underground. So, there aren't that many left, they've been steadily demolished ever since the turn of the 20th century, perhaps a little earlier. And now there are very few left. What aren't up for demolition are either listed or protected buildings or aren't long for this world. So they are a bit of Britain's industrial heritage that we will soon be saying goodbye to forever, But in the meantime, if there's still one near you, well, that's what it used to be used for. Say goodbye because it probably won't be around for long. That's a gasometer, and that is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
160,The Level Crossing You Have To Power Yourself,"I'm in the English countryside near Canterbury, and this is a level crossing. Nothing too unusual about that, except this is a user operated level crossing. And they are fairly few and far between. This little red and green light here tells you when it's safe to cross and then when it is you have to get out of the car that you drove up here in, and you have to physically pump the barriers to get them to rise. I'm aware quite how dodgy this movement looks. And this in itself is not too unusual, you know, there are crossings like this in odd regional parts of England, in the valleys of Wales, on smaller lines, but the thing you might not know is that this is not a provincial line This is a high speed rail line that has Javelin trains on the London to Ramsgate run. The ones that do 140mph. And, okay, they're not doing 140 here, they're doing about 40, maybe 50mph at most, but all that's stopping me from blocking this line, or worse, being hit by something on this line, is -well -this crossing and this little lever down here, that drops the barriers and makes it safe for the trains to cross again. That is a user operated level crossing and that is something you might not have known. [Subtitles: GC Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
161,Is Paris Syndrome A Real Thing?,"That's not gold paint on the bridge behind me, those are tens of thousands of padlocks. Put there by couples wanting to symbolize their everlasting bond. A bond that will, no doubt, hold them together into eternity as they steadily grow apart and more resentful of the other, eventually, spiraling down into death, always wondering what would have happened if they'd made different choices along the way. My issues aside, it's also a pretty good example of the difference between fantasy and reality, because those locks will not stay there for eternity. They will eventually rust and fall off or the council will come along and take them off with bolt cutters as happens fairly often. And that difference between fantasy and reality is the basis of something called Paris syndrome. And what it is, is a syndrome that affected mainly Japanese tourists, to the tune of about 20 a year, who would be so overwhelmed by the difference between their expectations of Paris as this city of light, and romance, and wonderful architecture, and art, and food, and everything, and the reality, which is a fairly dirty and polluted European city, the same as London or Berlin, or any other like it. The symptoms, well, they could be anything from delusions or hallucinations, all the way to tachycardia, which is irregular heartbeat, and other psychosomatic symptoms. Is it a real thing? Well, it's difficult to tell, because it does have journal articles about it, and it does have scholarly references and news articles, but I suspect if you looked at most cities with a big tourist industry, you'd have a good number of people sent home, just overwhelmed with jet lag and homesickness, every year. The fact that it's Paris, and it has this reputation, well, perhaps people are drawing a little too much signal from the noise of people just not able to cope with being away from home. Either way, it's Paris syndrome and it's something you might now have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
162,Privacy In France: A Lot Of French People Might Be About To Sue Me,"Right now, I am putting myself at risk of being sued. Why? Well, I'm filming in public, in Paris, in France. And French privacy law is some of the strictest and worst-defined in the world. See, it's been built over years, not by lawmakers, but by judges and case law. And what it means is this: just having someone identifiable in the back of my shot, even if I then don't publish it, might be grounds for someone to sue me. Or, maybe it won't. It's unclear. There are cases that have gone both ways. Maybe I should blur anyone's face who's even remotely in the back of shot, or maybe I shouldn't. It's still unclear. Maybe, if there's any modern architecture in the back of the shot, I should blur it out because that's copyrighted. Or, maybe under some other cases, it isn't. One thing has been clear though: I can take a photo of the Eiffel Tower in daytime, and it's fine, it's not under copyright any more. But, if I take a photo at night, the lighting design on it that is copyrighted. And so, I'd need a license before I were to publish that online. To make matters even more complicated, I am British, and I'll be publishing this when I'm in Britain, to YouTube which is an American company, which has an office in France. It would be a complete mess. Maybe I'd win if someone brought a case against me, maybe I wouldn't. But, either way, there'd be a long and costly legal battle. British law has a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own home, or in a private place but in public, if you're filmed, there's not much you can do about it. American law is much the same based on their First Amendment, and their very strong freedom of speech laws. But here? Well, France puts the power very much in the individual and their right to privacy over my right to film them. Maybe that's right. Maybe that's wrong. And, as for all these tourists around here taking photos, well... let's hope nobody sues them. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] Bye bye, Duggan!"
163,Point Zero: Where All Roads Start,"This is Notre-Dame in Paris, one of the most famous sights in the city. But I'm not here for the view from the top or for the flying buttresses, or even for religion. I'm here for something just outside it. If you look down from the top and stand just outside the main entrance, you will find a marker on the floor called Point Zero. Point Zero is the place from which all distances in France are measured from. Now, I'm filming all the way out here, by the way, because once one person starts taking video of it, it starts to attract tourists in the same way that artisanal French bread attracts pigeons. That's a visual metaphor for you there. France isn't the only country with a Point Zero; a lot of countries in the developed world have them. There'll be a marker or a monument somewhere in the capital city that says ""this is where the numbering starts from"". The UK though... ...uh, no, we don't have one, neither does the US. I mean, the UK does have Charing Cross in London, but only some roads are measured from there. And the US, well, you do have a marker in Washington, D.C., but, well, no one uses it for anything. Most US states restart their numbering when a road enters their territory. And, here in Paris, though, you have a marker that isn't really used anymore in these days of GPS and satellites. But what you have is a relic of a past time, a marker that simply says ""this is where we started from"". This is back when we had all the triangulation and manual calculations needed to actually map something, back when it was longhand. This is where it all began. That's Point Zero and that is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add you name here!]"
164,The 19th Century Channel Tunnel Wasn't Just A Dream,"I am under the English Channel on a train in one of the wonders of the modern world: the Channel Tunnel. And it's easy to take the tunnel for granted these days: you just buy a ticket, take your somewhat ridiculous leopard print suitcase-it's not mine-on board the train, and a couple of hours later you're in Paris. And it's easy to forget just what a wonder this thing is, and it's easy to forget that it was 200 years, nearly, from the first proposal to put a train under the English Channel-actually, it wasn't a train back then, it would've been horse drawn carrages lit by oil lamps-to this wonderful construction under the seabed itself. And here is something you might not know: those older schemes, those somewhat ridiculous Victorian schemes, some of them actually started. In 1881 exploratory tunnels were made about a mile out from the UK, and out from France. There was a tunnel started, but then the British press and politicians got cold feet, and thought it might compromise our national  security. And in the 1970s the British government at the time was all for building a tunnel, but then they got cold feet when the economy tanked. But just imagine: we might have had a Channel Tunnel a century earlier if it hadn't been for Britain being worried about its sovereignty, although given there was World War II and Hitler really could have invaded through it, perhaps they were onto the right idea. That is something you might not have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
165,"British Tanks Are Better Than All Other Tanks, And Here's Why","This is a Soviet T34 battle tank Well, okay... admittedly it's now a decommissioned hunk of metal. It was bought from the Czech army after the collapse of the Soviet Union used for some filming -a Shakespeare play of all things -and then bought by a local resident, here in Bermondsey And it's been installed on this bit of waste ground and painted ridiculous colors ever since. But that's not what I'm actually here to talk about, I'm here to talk about something a little more general. Specifically something that makes every British tank better than every other tank, and every other fighthing machine in the world. Now I realise that's a slightly Jeremy Clarkson-ish thing to say, so let me explain: British tanks all have something called a BV: a boiling vessel. Technically it's a CV or a cooking vessel now, but what it is: it's a square thing, about that big, that you put water in and you turn it on and it heats the water up ...it's a kettle. Basically, it is a kettle and all British tanks and all British fighting machines have one of these and what it means, is that British tank crews can have tea whenever they like. And to me, never mind your caterpillar tracks and your all-terrain and your range finders and your weaponry never mind all that. To me: the ability to have tea when ever you would like makes the British tank every other tank in the world! You can fight that one out in the comments. Anyway, that is something you've might not have known. Subtitles by: MM [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
166,The London Railway of the Dead,"In the middle of the 19th century London had a problem: It had too many dead people, and not nearly enough burial plots. Recently diseased bodies were having to be exhumed and then scattered in order to make room for more people to be put in the ground. Now that was obviously an enormous health risk, that contributed to cholera epidemics, which in turn contributed to more dead poeple. And so two industrialists came up with an audacious plan: They would build Europe's largest cemetery 20 miles outside of London in Brookwood. And they would run trains from there to here-to this terminus here in Waterloo-and it would be the London Necropolis railway. There would be first class funerals, and second class funerals, and third class funerals, which at least guaranteed you a gravesite, which was a cut above the mass graves that London was using at the time for the dead that couldn't afford anything better. And here is the astonishing thing, the thing you might not know: It worked! The London Necropolis railway was a real thing for nearly a century. The first train ran in 1854, and while the motor car starting to become popular did diminish the service in the 20th century. It ran until World War II. The only thing that stopped it was the bombing out of the railway tracks, and this whole area during the Blitz. If those tracks hadn't been bombed out, theoretically, we could still be seeing 21st century hearse trains going out to Brookwood. And that is something you might not have known.

167,Britain Has 555 Phone Numbers Too,"In any Hollywood movie, if someone has to dial a phone number, it will start 555 and there's a reason for that, not only is it American tradition, but the 5550 block is blocked out across America, for dramatic numbers, so all numbers that start 5550 with a couple of rare exceptions, will never get through. Now, there have been a couple movies that have tried to use other numbers because hearing 555 does take you out of the action a little, and Bruce Almighty managed to spark a whole load of people trying to call God when his number was flashed up on screen. Now of course that's slightly worse in America because the caller doesn't just pay for the phone call to a cellphone, the person with the cellphone pays as well. So, suddenly, someone was getting 20 or 30 calls an hour and all they were asking for was God. What you might not know though is that Britain also has numbers like that in one of the few good decisions that Ofcom, the regulator has ever made about phone numbers, there are a few blocks marked out. In London, it's 0207946, there's several blocks in cities across Britain, and for rural areas, an entire area code, 01632 that is guaranteed never to connect. There's a mobile phone number too, 077009, that whole block will never, ever get through to anything. And at the exchange level, well, it just cuts you off straight away. If you're on a cellphone, you'll never get through. And if you're on one of these, an old-fashioned land line, you won't even get halfway through dialling it before you get cu[PHONE CUT OFF SOUND EFFECT]"
168,Never Call Someone Tired and Emotional In England,"Behind me is the Carpenters Arms, the notorious London pub once owned by the Kray twins. Now, of course, it's a regular London pub in trendy Shoreditch there's a ukulele shop opposite it but that's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about the people in there. You see, I could say that the people in there were drunk. I could say that, but I'm not going to, because under English libel law, that could get me sued. See, English libel law has three tests for whether something is libellous: First, is it published, and yes, this is on YouTube, it's published. Secondly, is it defamatory? Could it impugn someone's character? And yes, saying they're drunk could do that. And thirdly, is it false? Except that's not strictly the test, because the burden of proof, if you are sued for libel, is on you, the defendant. I would have to prove that the people in there, whoever they were, were actually drunk, and without a police record, or without a breathalyser test, or footage of them downing an entire bottle of vodka, I can't actually prove that. I can say that they are 'happy' or perhaps 'merry' or 'in a pub' and that's fine, that's all true, but I can't necessarily prove that they are actually drunk. Now for that, the British press has a wonderful euphemism for many years: 'tired and emotional,' coined after a politician called George Brown gave that as a statement in 1967 for the reason he was behaving erratically. 'Tired and emotional' got picked up by Private Eye, the famous satirical magazine, and it entered British parlance, and now, well a lot of folks know that 'tired and emotional' means 'drunk' which means that nowadays, journalists in training are taught not to describe someone as 'tired and emotional', that just using that phrase itself might be libellous, because everyone knows that it means 'drunk.' British libel law is terrifying if you're a journalist, which is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
169,Origami In Space,"I'm with tef, who is going to tell you something you might not know about origami. Tef, take it away. I'd like to tell you about a piece of origami, that's in space. Now, space satellites, they have solar panels and solar panels need to unfold. You might imagine a piece of paper slowly unfolding. Unfortunately, to unfold most solar panels, you need two motors. One to pull it this way, and one to pull it up this way. But, Japanese astrophysicists realised that you could probably do it with one motor instead, and what he came up with was this. He could take a solar panel and unfold it with one motor all the way out. Not only that, he can also fold it all the way back in. How this actually works is, you fold the piece of paper into fifths, like so, admittedly I am making it look easy, and then what you do, is you fold it over repeatedly, almost making a snake all the way up such that there's a a little bit of an angle all the way up. But what this means is that this piece of paper can fold down far more compactly and far more quickly than your traditional folding. Now this actual fold is called the Miura fold and it's also used outside of solar panels. It's actually been recently tested with lithium ion batteries because it folds down so compactly it improves the energy density. But that's not the reason why I love this. Not because it's gone into space but because it works so well for maps. You can take a map out of your pocket, instantly unfold it, see exactly where you are, and instantly fold it back up again. And no other fold, I know for maps, can do this thing. So despite being an amazing piece of origami that's gone into space, it's actually the most useful piece of origami I know down here on earth.

170,Why Do We Not Have A Cure For The Common Cold Yet?,"I am back in the UK and I have a cold. I've lost my voice, I sound a little bit like Tom Waits. So, it is the 21st century: Why can I not just take a pill and cure this thing? Well, first of all the pills we do have are antibiotics and they don't work against colds. You'll have seen this poster in your doctor's office. You need a vaccination. And well, it's difficult to find a vaccination for the common cold, for the same reason that once you've have one cold your body is not automatically immune against all others. There are hundreds of the buggers and they keep mutating. It's the same reason why you have to have a flu shot every year. Actually that's worse than that, the World Health Organization has to predict, months in advance, which flu strains will be 'popular' this winter. And then ramp up vaccine production accordingly. And they've got natural selection against them too: If they release that vaccine too early, then the viruses that are able to rapidly mutate against it will be successful and will spread instead. The common cold works in a similar way: There are hundreds of strains constantly mutating. And because it doesn't generally kill people, just causes some discomfort, there isn't the millions and millions and millions in research funds going towards getting rid of it. So instead we take pain killers, and anti-inflammatories and decongestants, and we accept that we can win this battle on our own. Even though we cannot win the war. Because the enemy will go away, mutate, and just come back a few months later. And that is something you may not have known. And now I am going to stop talking. Closed captions by MM.

171,How Does A Geyser Work?,[Captions are available above]
172,Let's Talk About Names. In Iceland.,"I am in Iceland. It is both stunningly beautiful and stunningly cold, and it's also a very good place to talk about something you might not know, which is names. Specifically, how a lot of the world's namesâperhaps even a majorityâ don't fit into the English system of names given to you by your parents and then names inherited from your parents. Here in Iceland, for example, the idea that you have a family name handed down generation to generation to generation just doesn't happen. It's rare at best. Instead, children take their parents' first name with ""son"" or ""daughter"" added to it. Which instantly makes the Icelandic  telephone directory a little bit complicated: you have to index by first name and by occupation because there are so few last names in total. And if that sounds strange, well think of all the people you know whose last names are gonna be Thomson or Davidson or Peterson or Jameson. All of those are that Icelandic system, which used to be the English system, it's just changed now so it is a family name. And beyond that you have all the people who don't go by their legal name. Technically even I don'tâmy legal name is Thomas Scott, but I go by Tom. Add to that the people who go by their middle name, or who go by a nickname, or who just go by a different name for any number of reasons. Then you've got the cultures who put their family name first, which is always confusing when they're trying to translate over to English. Which brings me to a bit of advice, really. If you're asking for people's names, either on a paper form or online, don't put first name and last name. Don't putâthe worst-caseâ Christian name and surname. Just give someone a box to type intoâjust ask them what their name is. And for bonus points, then ask them how they want to be addressed, because, well, if you want to make friends, the best way is to get someone's name right. [Translating these subtitles?

173,Moss Is Terrible For Emergency Navigation,"So let's say you're lost in the woods. First of all, what the hell, how are you lost in the woods, how do not have an emergency plan, a map, a cell phone, something, but OK, let's say you're lost in the woods, let's say forces unknown have dropped you off here and left you to fend for yourself. OK. You know that given you have no references from the outside world â let's say it's cloudy, as it is â so you don't know where the Sun is. You know that humans will generally wander in a very large circle around and around and around until they collapse from exhaustion. But you know that if you keep going in one direction, if you manage to keep going straight, then you might well survive. But how do you know you're keeping in one direction without a compass or a map? Well, you should know, this is something that most people know, that moss grows on the north side of trees like this Because moss prefers damp conditions, dark conditions, and in the Northern Hemisphere the north side is going to be damper and darker because the sun will normally shine on the south. It's opposite of course in the Southern Hemisphere, sun's mostly in the north there, so moss will grow on the south. But I'm currently in the Northern Hemisphere â I know that much at least â so this must be the north side of the tree.... No. No, actually, that's not true at all because north is that way. North side of the tree: no moss. Because it's actually much more complicated than that, which is something you might not know. You should not use moss for emergency navigation, because the micro climates in the area â  particularly here, I'm in Ravenna Park in Seattle, this is just a ravine with very little in the way of sun from any direction â the micro-climate here means that the west side of the tree is actually going to be the darkest and dankest and mossiest. So if you're in a flat plane in perfect conditions, well perhaps it might help you, but for emergency navigation your best idea... Well, look, let's put it this way: I'm not Bear Grylls the best way of surviving is not to get lost in the woods in the first place. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
174,The Mississippi River Wants To Move,"I am in Baton Rouge, Louisiana How do I know that? Because it is written in enormous letters on this levee just here. And this levee is on the Mississippi River, the most important river in America. Not just because of the amount of water that it moves, but because of the amount of cargo. Look at all these barges just here that are waiting to have whatever they are carrying moved to the container ports and to the factories that line this river for miles and miles and miles and miles. But here is a problem, and something you might not know. The Mississippi river doesn't want to be here anymore. You see about a century ago, in the age of steamboats there was a bend in the river about 80 miles away from here called Turnbull's Bend And that took you twenty miles out of your way and of course, we're humans, we don't stand for that So a canal was built to cut that bend out of the way Now that caused a problem hydraulagic-hydra-hydral-hyda-that's a difficult word to say Hydraulogic hydrologic hydra... Water modelling wasn't really a science back then It was more a case of just try it and see what works So that new canal combined with the removal of a log jam on the Atchafalaya River meant that the Mississippi wanted to move. It had found a much faster, steeper, and quicker route to the sea So gravity took it that way Suddenly, the Mississippi didn't want to go this way It wanted to go down the course of the Atchafalaya River a completely different route to the ocean and that is a big problem because here we have all these factories all these container docks built, and relying on this river The Mississippi moving would be a multi billion dollar, possibly even a trillion dollar disaster for America And so, 80 miles upstream from here where once there was Turnbulls Bend is now the Old River Control Structure Built by the US Army Corps of Engineers, who are the frankly amazing group who handle enormous public works and dams in America The Old River Control Structure means that the Atchafalaya River is dammed is stopped and 70% of the flow coming into it still moves down the Mississippi It is, a battleground, if you like, between humans trying to keep our world working and nature, which very much wants to go its own way so there you go something you might not know the Mississippi River really doesn't want to be here anymore  "
175,Why Was AllAdvantage.com Popular In Beverly Hills?,"I am in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the French Quarter, in the Crescent City, the home of jazz and a really good place to talk about ZIP codes. No, seriously, because New Orleans is on the Mississippi, which is the dividing line between the west and the east of America. And ZIP codes work like this; up in the northeast, you have the zeros. Up in the southwest, you have the nines. And New Orleans, here in the middle, you have the sevens, not the fives. That's because the population density in the northeast is much higher. And so, you know, it's spread out by that rather than just geographical location, which does make sense. And there is one ZIP code, of course, that is more famous than all others: Beverly Hills' 90210. And the reason is a commitee decision at some point in the US postal service when they were setting up ZIP codes. At some point they decided that Beverly Hills would get this arbitrary number, and of course, a TV show made it famous. Something interesting though, that you might not know, back in 2000, there was a company called AllAdvantage. And their shtick was this: Download a program that would just put adverts permanently in the bottom of your screen, like watching a YouTube video only with everything. And that advert would stay there, permanently, blocking up a little bit of your screen, and in exchange, they would pay you quite a bit of money, 'cause this was 2000, this was the dot-com boom, this was when you could get away with paying a lot of money for banner ads. And then, they added a multi-level marketing scheme, like all the dodgy pyramid schemes that you still see today. If you referred other people, you would get a small cut of what they got, and all the people they referred would send some money to you as well. Obviously, the company died when the dot-com bubble crashed. That really didn't need to be mentioned, but, back in 2000, oh, this was a wonderful scheme. AllAdvantage.com released a press release, a very happy press release announcing that the most popular ZIP code for their users, Beverly Hills, 90210 And this was astonishing, because, why would the rich people at Beverly Hills want a few dollars an hour for putting a banner ad on their screen? If you have a referral scheme like that, where they're just giving out free money for something you do on a computer, well, people are going to cheat it. They're gonna install it many times on many computers, trying to get as much money out of it as possible. To do that, they need fake accounts. These folks aren't in the US, so what they do is they sign up with the only ZIP code they know: 90210. So that press release in the heady days of the dot-com boom, is a result of several decisions, One, the US postal service picking that ZIP code for that area, Two, a TV show picking that ZIP code for its title, and three, one very silly web service, burning through a lot of money, very quickly, and being scammed for all they could take. And that is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
176,Disney Could Go Nuclear If They Wanted To,"If you've been following my videos for the last couple of weeks you will know that I am at Disney World. It's not that they've sponsored me or anything, it is just where I happen to be on holiday. Now, I've been avoiding Disney trivia because, you know, it's a little bit boring after a while but there's something that my cameraman for the week, Dan W, -Hello! -told me that I didn't really believe at first, but he assures me it's true, I've looked it up, which is, well... Dan, where are we currently standing? DAN: We're at the Reedy Creek Improvement District. It's Walt Disney World's own private municipality. TOM: Yeah. Essentially, Disney World has private cities granted to them by the state of Florida because they lobbied a long time ago when they were buying all the land here and buying the space. They have all sorts of powers: they apply for planning permission from themselves, they have the ability to build all sorts of things, to be immune from laws of the neighboring areas that they would otherwise be beholden to. Not only that, they have eminent domain, as well, which means that they can seize small amounts of land from around their borders for their own municipality if they need it for the public good. And the startling thing is this: Dan, what they technically have permission to build? DAN: They have planning permission from themselves to build their own nuclear power station. It's in the legislation from the 1960s still. TOM: Now, that's because way back when they were actually planning to build a proper city here. And, while they've never actually built that nuke plant â they have a small oil-fired plant somewhere on property â  they had their own runway briefly, they had all sorts of things.  There was gonna be a massive city here and then Walt Disney died, and what we are left with is the Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow, or EPCOT. But you never know, one day there might well be a nuclear power plant here That is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
177,The SPF Rating On Sunscreen Is Questionable At Best,"I am a Brit in Florida, which means I apply enormous amounts of sunblock to stop me going as red as a lobster. But here is something you might not know: the SPF factor on sunblock, this 50 here, in this caseâbecause I am very paleâwas originally meant to be a multiplier. The idea was... that if you burned in 10 minutes without sunblock, that would multiply that by 50; you could manage 500 minutes in burning sun before you actually got burned. Now, the thing is: that's not actually true, because sunblock's a lot more complicated than that; it requires differences depending on skin tone, on all sorts of things, on your personal reaction. Unless the sunblock is broad-spectrum, as this is, it doesn't cover against the more harmful effects the long-term effects, not just turning red. So, how do they test it? Well, the way they test it is quite wonderful. The FDA in the US for thisâThe Food and Drug Administrationârequires what is known as an ""in vivo"" test. Meaning it has to be done on an actual live volunteer, which means that someone has, presumably, one arm covered in sunblock, one arm not, and then they are put under a test sun simulator until they burn to see what happens. And, while it can, technically, get up to 100-200 times multiplier, the FDA requires no more than 50. In Australia no more than 30, because anything more than that is considered confusing to people who might think they can put sunblock on and stay out all day, every day, with no risk of skin cancer. So, there you go. Sun Protection Factor mostly a load of rubbish, although, you should still wear it because otherwise, well, you're going to end up like I'm going to look in probably a few hours' time. And that...

178,How To Tell If You're Dreaming,"""A dream is a wish your heart makes"" is from Walt Disney, and from Cinderella. That is Cinderella's Castle. It's not true, of course; a dream is a random firing of neurons that your brain is trying to interpret, but it's a lovely saying. And there are people called oneironauts âthat's the technical term they've come up withâwho are dream explorers, people who do lucid dreaming. The idea that you can, sort of ""wake up"" in your dream, be aware that you're dreaming, and then control whatever you want: fly, talk to people, beat fears, whatever you want to do. Now, I've tried to do this in the past; it's not been terribly successful for me, but one of the things I did learn is something that you might not know, which is how to tell if you're dreaming. There's a check you can start doing a couple of times a day, that is, apparently, quite a good trick to learning to lucid dream. And the simple test is this: read something. Read anything, the words on a sign, a newspaper, whatever you want. Not only will they not make sense, but they will change every time you look away and look back at them. They'll just be whatever words that your brain happens to come up with, from everything in the dictionary, utter nonsense. Whatever your brain happens to come up with, whatever neurons in the language centres of your brain happen to fire, those'll be the words you read. So, if that happens, look down at the thing in front of you right now, I mean, I'd imagine that computers don't work in dreams, either, and that's another good sign. So either you're dreaming, or you're running Windows. But, basically, look for words. See if they change, and if they do, well... don't try and wake up, try and have a bit of fun first. That's lucid dreaming and that is something you might not have known. I think I found Donald Duck(!) [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
179,The Datablast: Experimental Interactive TV From The 1990s,"Nowadays if you want to interact with a TV programme, you pick up the phone or you text, and you vote. And if you want a lot of information you go on the web. But it wasn't always so, before the web got mainstream, what you would do is you would send a stamped addressed envelope if you wanted a big pack of information. This means, for anyone born after, say, about 2000, you would take an envelope, you would address it to yourself. you would put a stamp on it, you would put it in another envelope, and you would post that envelope off to the TV company. And a couple of weeks later they would get it, open it, put their information in the envelope you'd written to yourself, send it back to you, and then finally a month later you would actually have some information from the TV company. Now, in the early 90s, before the web came along, someone did have an idea: a couple of British programs on ITV... Yo, Yo, Bad Influence. Check it out! Mc Crane, kick it one time. I'm sorry! -experimented, with something called a datablast. Home video recorders were now a thing. So, over the credits of their shows, right at the end, they would put information in each frame over the credits. So that home viewers could record the whole thing, and then pause through at their leisure. Which was a good idea in theory, in practice it was a bad idea because the web came along, and it was a bad idea because home video recorders aren't nearly good enough to manage that: they stutter, they create artifacts, they have all sorts of problems. But who knows? If the web hadn't come along, maybe, maybe, even now we'd have a datablast at the end of each of our TV shows. And that is something you might have known [Closed captions by MM.

I got a couple of complaints about that, mainly about me falling in the pool at the end. A couple of people complained that my acting was terrible. It was. A couple of people claimed that the push was obviously faked and scripted. It was, because anyone who would push someone into a pool without their permission is an absolute jerk, and I wouldn't want to hang around with them, but no-one picked up on the real obvious clue it was fake. Not even the underwater camera shot that didn't have a camera in the wider angle. No, the reason is if you actually try and push someone into a pool it doesn't look like that. You push someone into a pool they're not going to want to go in: priority one, don't go in the pool, priority two, keep your head above water. So, it tends to be sort of a half stagger and then a bounce, and then they come out dry from here upwards. You push someone into a pool in the movies or on TV though, and it looks a little bit something like this. Go, Hadley! The difference is-he says, retrieving the new camera-I went in back first, as low as I could go, as much 'umph' as I can manage going under water, and then, you can see that I actually keep myself under water: my arms are pedalling the wrong way, because it looks way more impressive if I'm under water for a couple more seconds than I actually would be. Anyone sensible, anyone who's actually intending to get thrown into the water, wouldn't stay under, they'd barely go under at all, their hair might even be entirely dry. But you push someone into a pool in television: you need to convince the audience that it's a big splash, that it's a big under water 'boomph' that sends them all the way down. In reality, as ever, it's not nearly as impressive. And that is something you might not know. And now,  here are all the other takes of me getting pushed into the pool. If you're doing this, make sure there's enough distance between the person you're throwing in and the edge of the pool. You want to wait for the go signal next time? Sorry! [Closed captions by MM.

181,Your GPS Shuts Down If It Goes Too Fast,"If you have a GPS unit in your car, in your smartphone, in whatever it will almost certainly not work if you go above 60,000 feet or go faster than 1200mph. And the reason... ...is this! This is the Rocket Garden at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. And those are intercontinental ballistic missiles that they strapped a person on top of and sent them into space. And when GPS was being developed by the US Department of Defense, the Cold War was still going on. And well, they didn't want Soviet ICBMs to be incredibly precisely targeted. And so all the GPS chips that are for consumer use have this restriction in them that if you go too fast or too high they will say, ""Oh no, I am a missile!"" And stop working. And the only time that this has really affected anyone is in the last few years as high-altitude unmanned ballooning has taken off, the kind of stratospheric weather balloons that take gorgeous pictures from on high. Because when they come down they need to be tracked, and the GPS unit suddenly thinks it's in the stratosphere, it must be a missile, and it shuts down. And the solution?  Some of these GPS units only shut down if you're going too high AND too fast.  Find one of those, you can use it in your balloon. Otherwise, it's probably best if you stay a little bit closer to Earth. And that is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
182,The Hard Part About Getting To Orbit Isn't The Height,"This is launch pad 39, at the Kennedy Space Center! This is where all the Apollo missions launched from. This is where more than 50 Space Shuttle missions launched from. This pad here, this is the flame trench where all the, the steam generated and the fire generated by those rockets comes out uhm I I am just uh astonished to be standing here in this place and here is something you might not know The difficulty with getting to orbit is not just the altitude it's mainly the speed If you want to go to orbit Then you have to go 15 thousand miles an hour if you're going up to International Space Station height 15 thousand miles an hour That's what most of that fuel goes on If you don't have that speed then you're going to go up... ...and you're going to come straight back down If you can't go fast enough to dodge the curvature of the Earth Then you're just going to come straight back down. The energy budget isn't just on altitude, it's on speed. It goes from chemical energy in the rocket To kinetic energy as it flies and goes across And then burns it off as heat and friction as it plunges back down into the atmosphere. If you're just falling through the atmosphere you don't burn up but if you're going 15 thousand miles per hour plunging into it and using it as drag to stop then, you get the trouble with burning up on reentry. So there you go the problem with orbit is not altitude but speed. And that is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] And that's that shot gone."
183,How To Throw A Bucket Of Water At Someone,"I am with Kevin Prince and I'm going to teach him something that you might not know, which is how to throw a bucket of water at someone. Yeah, you can have the bucket. All right, this is not if you want to actually drench someone if you're angry at them, but this is how you throw a bucket of water if you are on stage. I got taught this by a pantomime dame several years ago, when I was in panto. And the key thing is, that what you would do normally to drench someone is not what you want to do on stage, because there's a big audience watching on YouTube or in the theater. And you want to go for dramatic effect and you also don't want to soak through the costume. So, do you want to fill the bucket. Fill up the bucket.There we go! About halfway. About halfway. There you go! Yep! That's good, because if you fill it too much, then you're going to have too much momentum, you won't be able to heft it. Too little: it's not going to look good. So, you want to aim for the chin. This is the key. Bucket of water. Aim for the chin. Two reasons: Number one, you hit him in the chest it's going to absolutely drench them, which means dry out the costume, lots of time. Number two, hit the chin, creates an enormous splash, goes backwards, gives a brilliant show for the audience, doesn't really get the person wet. --So, are you ready? --Yep! Okay. It's been a while since I did this. You ready? Yep. Aim for the chin. Go! You missed! Everything from here upwards is dry! You... Do you want to try that again? Alright, fill it halfway. One. Two. Three. That is how you throw a bucket of water at some... And that... [water noise] God dammit, Mel! [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
184,British Ice Cream Doesn't Have To Contain Milk,"I am in Morocco! Well, not really. I'm actually in Disney's version of Morocco, in EPCOT --which is why this particular back street has an emergency exit. And here is something you might not know, and it's about... ice cream. See, I'm in America. And in America, this ice cream has to contain milk. Actual milk. Specifically, a certain percentage of milk fat. But if I were in Britain, that's not necessarily the case. You see, British ice cream, unless it has the phrase ""dairy"" on it, can actually be made of something called ""bleached deodorised, hydrogenated vegetable oil"". Which means that the stuff you get out of ice cream vans and the cheap stuff you get in supermarkets might not have any milk in it at all. This, on the other hand, is American ice cream, which means I can be certain -or at least reasonably certain -that it's made with milk. And that's something you might not have known.

185,Einstein Wasn't The First Scientist To Talk About Relativity,"I'm in an airplane bathroom aboard a 777 somewhere over the mid-Atlantic. It's a long flight and this is a strange place to film a video, but it is the perfect place to tell you about relativity. Specifically, that Einstein was not the first person to have ideas about relativity. Centuries earlier, Galileo came up with the concept of what now is called ""Galilean relativity,"" which is the more basic idea that if you're in â well, he would have been thinking about something like the hold of a sailing ship â but if you're in an airplane bathroom, there is no physics experiment you can do that will tell you how fast you are going. You could be going 500 mph, as we are, you could be going at 9/10 the speed of light, magically, given you'd actually burn up to a cinder, you could be stopped, just hovering in some kind of simulator at this altitude, and there is no way you could tell, because, well, you can't see what you're going relative to. And that idea, that there is no privileged frame of reference, was built upon by Einstein, who realized that if you are in an airplane bathroom going at 9/10 the speed of light and you turn the headlights of the plane on, well, the pilot of the plane would see the light go at the speed of light and an observer would also see it going at the speed of light, that crucial idea is where all of relativity comes from, the idea that there is no privileged frame of reference. But that was Galileo's idea centuries earlier. And that is something you might not have known. And here's another thing. If I was clever, if I was really clever, then what I would do is film this in a completely fake airplane bathroom and now, to prove my point, I would have the walls fall away... I've got about 5 hours left in this flight. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
186,Why Is London's Cable Car So Damn High?,"This is London's Cable Car, the Â£60 million boondoggle that the Mayor of London insisted was a vital part of the city's transport infrastructure. And here's the thing. That is a really tall cable car, 90 metres. If you want a cable car with a view over the city, you don't need it to be that high. Why is it so tall? Well, the answer to that is down the river, at the QE2 Bridge, at the Dartford Crossing, which for many years has been the height limit for vessels, cruise ships, warships coming into the city. Now, when this cable car was built, one of the requirements was that those ships could not be impeded. They must still be able to come into London. But here's something you might not know. This height, this expensive height here, is a compromise. Every metre you ratchet up the height, you also ratchet up the cost, but it has to be high enough to let those vessels pass underneath. And the thing you might not know is that, well, the way they bodged it is that if a tall ship needs to come underneath at low tide, they will remove all the gondolas and make sure there's no passengers on board. Put everything safely away. So that the wire, unladen, raises up enough to let boats pass. It is a bodge job at best. but then that pretty much sums up the Mayor of London. And that is something you might not know. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
187,British Nuclear War from Beyond the Grave: The Letter of Last Resort,"This is the Camberwell Submarine. It's not actually a submarine, it's a heating boiler and exhaust for most of the houses around here, but it's the closest I can find to a submarine that I've got access to. So, here I'd like to tell you about something you might not know, which is the ""letter of last resort"". The UK has four Trident-class nuclear submarines. They are our main nuclear deterrent; we're one of the few countries that actually has nuclear capability.  The thing about nuclear war is, it is monumentally stupid.  It involves the deaths of everyone involved and uncountable numbers of civilian casualties.  So the thing is... if you were the Prime Minister and you know that there are missiles launching towards the UK and you have four minutes to respond as was quite possible during the 1980's... What do you do? Do you launch?  Do you send yours off in return, knowing that the only thing it can accomplish, knowing that you cannot intercept the incoming missiles, the only thing that you launching can accomplish is killing more innocent civilians? Do you launch, do you take the retaliatory strike that you've always threatened?  Or... do you accept that all you can do at this point is kill more people and not launch? And more importantly... What if the Prime Minister is already dead? What if the second-in-command is already dead? What if the attack has hit and nothing has gone out to the British nuclear submarines? Different navies around the world have different ways of dealing with this, and the British way of dealing with it is just... an almost poetic way of doing things. Inside every British nuclear submarine, inside a safe, inside another safe is one of four letters, all identical and handwritten by the Prime Minister. And every Prime Minister that comes to power, even now, even David Cameron, one of their first duties is to sit down and hand write four letters that say to the commander of each nuclear submarine, if all has failed, if Britain is destroyed, if the Prime Minister is dead, if everyone in the chain of command is dead and you have nothing else to do... ...do you launch? And if the submarine surfaces and finds that Britain is destroyed and one of the tests they use is whether Radio 4 is still broadcasting... allegedly... they look in the safe. They open the envelope, they look at the letter, and that tells them whether they kill uncountable numbers of people as retaliation or whether they go the nearest friendly port and do what they can to rebuild. And that's thing about nuclear war: once it's started, all bets are off. You may as well just give up because the idea was never to launch... ...it was always to deter. And that is something you may not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
188,Why Wind Farms Don't Always Turn When It's Windy,"I am at one of the tallest wind farms in Europe. Look at that! Isn't that beautiful? You can't tell right now, but basically, when the cloud goes over, that is so high that it casts a shadow on the cloud as it's passing by. But the reason I' m here is because of something you might not know, which is why, when it's windy wind farms aren't always on and rotating. And there are a couple of reasons. One, is that wind farms aren't built to take extremely high wind speedsabove 50-55 mph it starts to get dangerous and this beautiful thing could rip itself apart. So, at high winds they slam the brakes on and they stop them running, because the amount of energy they would lose from doing that is much less than the amount of energy you would constantly lose if you had to build this thing to withstand hurricane force winds. The other reason is that the national grid can't cope with more than enough power being dumped into it. There are no giant storage batteries, that can hold the entire output of a power station. So, what happens is, if the demand is low, then they will just turn off the ones, that are easy to turn off, like this. And when demand rises again, they will turn on this and hydroelectric power plants, in order to deal with instant demand. Nuclear, coal, gasall much harder to shut down, all much harder to start up. And so, the national grid keeps us balanced at 50 Hertz-50 cycles a second, 60 in America, 50 in Britain-by monitoring the plants like this and turning them on or off, as needs be. And that is something you might now have known. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"

Okay, I'm going to take my classes off. That's a very good idea. Alright. Because the key ingredient in stage slapping is that you react. I will pretty much do very little. But you have to sell it by doing the ""Woaah!"" Yea, okay. -Got it? --Okay. So, key ingredient number one: I will tell you, that I'm about to slap you... -Okay --By putting my hand on your face. Okay. Then, I will slap my hand, not your face. Okay, I trust you here! --So, don't be scared. --Okay. --When my hand leaves your face... --Yep! Move! --Alright. -That way obviously. That way: not in the hell. That way! --Got it. --Ready? --Yep. 3, 2, 1 --Can I try this then? --Yes. --I'l sell it this way. --Yep. --So, you put your hand there... --Yeah. And then you do that. Yes! Okay! --But at the point of which I feel your hand leave my face... --I didn't do that. I throw myself. Okay! Yeah, yeah,  yeah,  yeah? Jesus! That's brilliant. Do you want to do one more?

Right, so, the best way to do 'stage choking' or strangling rather is that you do nothing. Okay, I like this. So literally put your hand on my breastbone, chestplate -Do you want to get in closer on that, so I can see where I'm putting this? -Do nothing. -Okay. Let me do all of the work.

This isn't just, however, the convenient place to put it. Kings Cross currently has a Platform 0, which means that eventually after they're done with all the redevelopment Problem 0 will get renumbered: It will become Platform 1. 1 will become 2, 2 will become 3, 8 will become 9, 9 will become 10.

192,"A Zeppelin, A Cat, and The World's First In-Flight Radio Message","Tom: I'm with Simon Willison, zeppelin expert. Simon: Hello! Tom: Simon, tell them something they don't know. Simon: So.. In 1910 the airship America made the first ever attempt at a cross Atlantic crossing. And, on the way into the airship one of the engineers scooped up a stray cat, who'd been living in the hangar. The cat, they, they christened the cat Kiddo, put him on the airship. Said: ""This will be great, we'll take him along, he can be the ship's mascot."" Kiddo was not keen on this idea at all, kicked up a real stink, and so once they got out of the Atlantic they transmitted the first ever radio message from an aircraft, and the message was: ""Roy, come and fetch this goddamn cat."""" So, they sent a life boat out to fetch the cat. The cat was put in a bag, lowered down to a boat, really jumpy water, the cat was furious, the waves were too choppy, they couldn't rescue him. They ended up having to hoist him back on board. ""So, okay, we'll take him with."" The cat then settled down, obviously deciding the airship was a lot better than the bag. And, you know, it settled into the flight. They quickly discovered that he was the perfect companion, because cats are better than barometers: the cat would get grumpy before they hit bad weather, way before any of their instruments could detect it. That was all fine, but they were trying to cross the Atlantic. 33 hours in, the airship broke,-possibly because of sand that they picked up earlier-they couldn't steer it, they found themselves adrift. They eventually spotted a Royal Mail ship out at sea, managed to signal SOS to them, got rescued by it. And I think they made the first ever aerial SOS call as well. And they were rescued, along with the cat. The airship floated off and was never seen again. The Royal Mail ship went back to New York, where Kiddo was put on display in the window of a fancy department store with a diamond necklace on as a celebrity cat, and he really did live the rest of his life out on the farm. Tom: Simon, thank you very much! That is something you might not have known. Simon: Thank you! [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"

Each sheet costs about Â£1 and that is because it's so unbelievably thin: less than a micron. It's been rolled and rolled and rolled and flattened and put into this little booklet. And, uh...

194,The Secret Button on Pedestrian Crossings,"Last week, I did a video about pedestrian crossings, and while I don't want this to turn into 'things you might not know about British pedestrian crossings,' Well, there is one more thing, and quite a few people got in touch to say I should point it out. There is a secret button, or nodule, on the bottom of these things you push when you want to cross the road. And what that little secret nodule is, is a sign for anyone who is blind and deaf, or partially blind and partially deaf. Or, who is partially blind and at a crossing that does not make a beeping noise when it's safe to cross, which is a surprising amount of crossings. Because that little nodule rotates any time that signal turns green, as we will now see. Because don't forget, disability isn't a thing that turns on or off, you don't just get people who are entirely blind but fine every other way, or entirely deaf but perfectly able to see. You get lots of folks who might be able to walk around safely in the world, but who couldn't make out that signal, and who couldn't work out the beeping from the background noise, even if there was some. So that little nodule means it's safe for a lot of British people to cross the road, and that is something you might not have [laughing over the sound of a bus] Why do I do videos near roads?

195,The Thames Still Has Some 19th Century Stink In It,"This is the Thames, the river that flows through London. Now, in the 19th century the Thames stank, literally. The flush toilet had been invented, but the sewerage system hadn't, which meant that all that waste got flushed straight into the Thames. Now, to make that worse, the Thames is tidal here, so, it didn't always just get washed out to sea, sometimes it came back. Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that, because salty water is heavier, so, it kind of went over the... Anyway, that doesn't matter, what matters is that Joseph Bagel... Joseph Bazalgette! I keep saying ""Bagelgette"", Joseph Bazalgette-a wonderful Victorian engineer with an enormous ridiculous mustache -built the massive sewerage system, that now flushes most of London's waste away, Including right here, underneath the Embankment, but that was built for a 19th century London and stayed during the 20th. And now, this is such a big city, such an enormous metropolis, that there is not enough capacity, so here is something you might not know: the Thames to this day still sometimes has raw sewage pumped into it. After a strong rain storm, if it's been raining for days and there's just too much crap for London to deal with, the Thames gets it instead. And that is something you might not know, that the Thames still has a bit of 19th century stink in to it now and again. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
196,Why Does Nighttime Smartphone Footage Look All Flickery in Europe?,"I'm in TromsÃ¸ in Norway, That is the TromsÃ¸ bridge, and the beautiful Arctic Church there. Now, if you've been following my videos from here for the last couple of days, you might have noticed something a bit weird every time I'm under artificial light. And let's be honest: That's most of the time. Because, while it does get light in the middle of the day here, we're in the Arctic Circle, it's winter. The sun doesn't get above the horizon. Mind you, when it does get light, this place is beautiful. Anyway, you might have seen a bit of a weird effect, if I take a slow motion video of that streetlamp, and the ground under it, you'll see what I mean. There's this kind of weird strobing, rolling effect going on. And the reason for that, is something you might not know, the difference between the European and American power grids. See, the European power grid runs at 50 hertz, 50 cycles a second. That means the alternating current in the wires switches direction, a hundred times a second, 50 cycles back and forth, back and forth And that means all these lights, that you can see, pretty much, dim imperceptibly a hundred times a second. Not enough that you can see it with the naked eye, but the camera will pick it up. Now, okay, that's not a major problem if your camera runs at the same rate as the lights The lights run at 50 hertz, British television runs at 50 hertz. But unfortunately, I'm using an iPhone, which is designed in the U.S., for the American power grid. The American power grid chose to run at 60 hertz, 60 cycles a second, so American TV runs at 60, or 30 frames a second. So, the camera is recording at 30 frames a second, the light is pulsing at 50 hertz, those two are out of sync, and so sometimes you get light, and sometimes you get dark. But, why the rolling effect? Well for that, we have to understand the rolling shutter in a camera. Or in any modern camera. Old film cameras don't do this, obviously, they just expose a shot every time a frame goes by. But, no-no, not this. THIS camera, and all modern cameras run, a line at a time, scrolling down the screen. Which means it can take a fraction of a second difference for it to go from the top of the frame, to the bottom And the result is this rolling effect. Some of those lines are recorded when the light is fully on, and some of those lines are recorded when the light is dim. And that's the reason. That's the reason you have this kind of weird, artificial, rolling light problem, when you're filming with an American device in Europe. 'Course the easy way to fix it, would be for Apple just to have a 25 frames a second option, but that would be far, far too difficult for them... And THAT is something you might not have known.

197,The Underground Roundabouts of TromsÃ¸,"I find it very easy to get excited about infrastructure.

This is the TromsÃ¸ tunnel system. So what, you say, it's just a tunnel. Well, yes it is, but what it actually is is a massive series of tunnels connected by roundabouts underground. Now, I realize that to my American viewers just the concept of a roundabout in itself might be mindblowing, but a roundabout underground? That actually takes the congestion away from the surface, that is essentially every 1970s sci-fi city planner's dream come true, actually in place and working?

198,The 134-Hour Television Show from the Arctic Circle,"I'm in TromsÃ¸, in Norway, in the Arctic Circle, And this beautiful thing here; is one of the boats that plies the Hurtigruten, and I am probably mispronouncing that. But the fast route from down in the south-west of Norway, all the way to here in the Arctic Circle. And I say fast route, it takes seven days. But here is something you might not know, this is an excellent example of slow television. Something that the NRK, the National Broadcaster, the equivalent of the BBC or PBS, excels at. In 2011 they took a load of cameras and just attached them to this boat and broadcast its journey 24 hours a day as it went up. Well not specifically this boat, one very much like it. Also, because they did it in the middle of summer and it was not a freezing cold mid-afternoon -it's about 2:30 as I record this -It was beautiful all the way. Norwegan fjords, gorgeous sun, well if you want to see it fortunately they released all the footage through Creative Commons, so there's some interesting mashups here on YouTube if you don't want to wait the full 134 hours. But people did. Here's the strange thing: people did watch this. Maybe just for a few minutes, maybe for a few hours, maybe they just kept it on the television all the time, in the same way as they kept on the train that stayed for 24 hours thorough Norway or the log fire that simply burned. Slow television is an antidote to the reality TV show and the fast cut editing of today. And is it massively popular? Well, no, of course not, that's why you're watching 2 minute videos on YouTube rather than 134 hours of footage of a boat, but don't rule it out because its surprising how many people will just tune in for a little while, to something calming and pleasant and slow And that is something you might not have known.

On the back of the British Â£10 note they are the pollen around the flower around the flower, next to Charles Darwin. On the US $20 bill, they are the numbers in the ""20""s, in the background. This is called the EURion constellation or at least that's that name it was given by the German computer scientist called Markus Kuhn who discovered it. You put this into a colour photocopier and its image processing algorithms will recognized this pattern. It's designed to be really easy for computers to recognize and it will refuse to copy it. Which means that if you want stop from copying something, put this image on it. Of course,  you can still just take a picture of it and print it out but if you are forging bank notes with a colour photocopier something has probably gone wrong with your life. And that is something you may not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
200,How To Make An Orange Peel Flamethrower,"I'm with Felix Cohen, who runs the Manhattans Project. Hi there! Tell them something they don't know! So we're going to look at how to do flames out of citrus peels today. First of all, I'm going to get a drink that we can actually flame, and make it worthwhile. So we're going to make a Mandarin Sour with Mandarin Napoleon We're going to get a double shot of that, the juice of half a lemon a little bit of sugar syrup going in there. And then also the white of an egg. And we're going to take an orange. You want to get a nice firm peel on the orange So this is not a particularly big one but it's got a good feel to it. And you're going to want to cut a piece roughly the size of a Â£2 coin. Try not to bend it at any point. You'll want to keep it as flat as possible. We've got just a little bit of pith on the back of that. And then grab a lighter. I like to use a Zippo for this, 'cos you get a better flame out of it but matches are also good or even just a petrol lighter. You're going to hold the flame between the orange peel and the glass and you're going to have the orange peel between first fingers and your thumb. Making sure not to bend it. And you just want to warm it up gently here. and that is just breaking open a whole bunch of vessels in the skin of the orange that hold the orange oil which is what we're going to set on fire. So once you've warmed it, just hold the flame between it and gently pinch and you'll get a nice flame out of the orange which is burning the oils and gives the drink a really delicious smell. -Thank you very much, Felix! -Thank you. Cheers! -That is something you might not have known. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
201,Why Aren't There More Helicopter Crashes In London?,"This is the St George Wharf Towerthe enormous residential block, that is nearly completed -in Vauxhall. Now, the start of 2013 a helicopter crashed into the crane, that was building this... building. And, well... It was the first fatal helicopter crash in London, since records began. But the reason those are so rare, is because there is a massive safety precaution in London: Helicopters must follow the river. And there are two reasons for that: One, is that the London City Airport flight path ends at London City Airport, about 8 miles that way. In fact, you can see a plane coming in now. That way air traffic control now that over the river there might be helicopters, but without special permission: without a police helicopter, an air ambulance, or someone who's filed a filming permit months in advance there... Okay, it is windy up here, and that is a long way town. Without special permission, air traffic control know that there won't be helicopters in the way of the planes. But the second reason is more important, and that is: if a helicopter suffers an engine failure , most pilots-most qualified pilots-will be able to put the helicopter down safely, because helicopters can do something called ""autorotation""-they can powered by the air going through the blades as they fall-and make a safe landing. But where's a safe landing spot in a city this big? You're probably going to hit a building or a person, no matter where you come down, unless you are flying over the river and following its path, in which case, if your engine suddenly fails you're going to be fine. A bit wet, but fine, unless of course, someone puts an enormous building in the way and it's foggy. And that is something you've might not have known! And I'm getting down from here now. Seriously, that's a really long way down! [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!] Subtitles by: MM"
202,There Are Special Crossings For Horses In Britain,"I am about to cross a road, and here is something you might not know: In Britain, there are special crossings for horses. Not kidding. Because what I'm on is technically known as a 'bridleway'. It's a footpath that horses and riders can use as well. So here we have a special button-there's one up there as well for if you're already mounted on your horse-and a special staging area, that I'm currently standing in, in which horses can wait before the lights change and they are able to cross the road that way. And here is the best part: the best part is the name, because in Britain we have Pelican crossings, """"Pedestrian Light Controlled"" they're the normal ones. And then they came up with Toucan crossings, because they were for pedestrians and bikes, so ""two-can"" cross there. Then they came up with Puffin crossings-I can't remember why they're called that-but they're the ones with the special cameras and lights, like those up there-that will track pedestrians as they cross and not stop the traffic any more than they have to. And then, because all those are named after flying things: we have this, which is a Pegasus crossing. And that is something you might not know. [Closed captions by MM. Translating these subtitles?

203,I finally found a useful monorail.,"I have a bit of a history with monorails. Back in 2016, I visited the Wuppertal suspended monorail in Germany, and I said that monorails are almost always a bad idea. Monorail enthusiasts sent me angry messages, but I stand by that. In 2020, I visited one of the last surviving Roadmachines cargo monorails. They were actually useful and practical, but they were temporary constructions designed for having cargo hauled around work sites. And they've been replaced by modern heavy construction equipment. Monorails are usually bad ideas, because the track has to be either elevated or in a trench, and because switches at junctions involve moving the whole track. In almost every case, a monorail is a worse and more expensive idea than light rail, or a tram, or a bus. But. While I was researching a while ago, I found a type of monorail that is useful and practical and better than any alternative for its job. And not only is it still in use, new versions of it are being built. So I reached out to the company that makes them and I asked them, ""Can I have a go on one, please?"" This is the Monorack. We build mainly ropeways. That's our main business. Everything with the rope. Aerial tramways, chair lifts, ski lifts. And Monorack is a Garaventa product since nearly 45 years. In 1978 I think, or '79. Some two years after the petrol Monorack, they start with electrical Monoracks. They installed mainly in the Alp area. Germany, Switzerland, a lot of Monoracks in Italy, but also Canada, Sweden, Asia. All over the world we have more or less about 800 Monoracks. The petrol Monoracks are mainly installed in the agriculture area. The electrical Monorack usually is quiet, but here the customer made his own box. That's the reason why it's still a little bit loud! The invention that makes this thing so useful is down on the track. This is a rack railway, so the track has grooves and the cogs onboard the train lock into it. That means it can climb very steep hills like this and take tight corners with no risk of slipping. Having just one lightweight rail means it doesn't take up much room. It can go around tight corners and it's easy to install. Being elevated, means it can go over rough terrain and if there's rain or mud below, it doesn't matter. I genuinely can't think of a better solution for regularly, safely, moving things up and down steep, rough terrain like this. Every Monorack is based on a brake, and on a engine chassis. And what's between the two chassis is up to the customer, we can choose different models, different chairs, whatever the customer needs or wants. You can see the charging rails. If the customer wants two or three, he can choose two or three charging points. Normally we have only one, in one of the end stations. I know this sounds like an advert, I promise it isn't. I just got actually properly enthusiastic at being proved wrong. There are useful monorails in the world. And this? This is one of them."
204,I thought the treadmill crane was fictional.,"For more than 25 years, there's been a medieval castle under construction in France. The builders and designers here are using plans and techniques that are as historically accurate to the 13th century as possible. GuÃ©delon Castle is experimental archeology and a tourist attraction. The techniques rediscovered here, they're now helping with the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral. But I'm here for one very specific piece of technology that I'd never heard of, and which to me feels like something out of the anachronistic fiction of AstÃ©rix or the Flintstones. It's called the treadmill crane and it is a real thing from history. Now I'm not an archeologist or a historian so I'm going to let someone tell you about this place, and about this crane, while I actually go and get some stone and learn to power this thing. So when we say we're building a medieval castle, of course we have to be very clear about which period of the Middle Ages we're interested in. So we've narrowed down our area of interest to the 13th century. To be even more precise, when we laid the first stone we said it was the year 1228 and each year we move forward in history. So this year on site, you are in the year of our lord 1253. So in order to find out what technology was available at that time, we have a number of different sources. We use illuminated manuscripts, stained glass windows, financial records. Of course we work with archeologists, art historians, and castellologists. And so we've got all that information together in order to decide how the castle should be built. Sometimes we know how to do it, sometimes these skills have never been lost, others have been completely lost and we have to then revive them from scratch. The castle itself will be finished in about another 10 years. So we're taking about 35 years in all to finish the castle which is a really long time compared to the Middle Ages. Because one of the reasons that we're building this castle is to show the visiting public. So half the time my colleagues are putting down their tools in order to explain the work we're doing. So here we are at the single drum winch. Okay. So that needs to go up there. Yes. Okay. We can provide the tower with those rocks, so we can build it. Okay. We might say that we're building a 13th century castle but in terms of health and safety we're clearly in the 21st century. So you will see anachronisms on site. We have hard hats, steel toe capped shoes, protective eyewear, masks when we're working with the sandstone from the quarry. All the scaffolding is heavily reinforced. So obviously we're not trying to discover how many people were killed or injured in the 13th century. So take care of your back. The castle that we're building here today is the castle that would've belonged to a low ranking local fairly modest nobleman. This isn't a royal castle. It's essentially being built as a private home but there will be defensive elements within the castle. There'll be a portcullis, there'll be murder holes, arrow loops, crenelated walling. And all of this even though there's very little chance that the castle would've been attacked in the middle of the 13th century these features are still in place. You never know. There's not any fancy modern pulleys or anything like that, it's just-No no, it just-Diameter of this versus diameter of this. Yes. It's like if you were making a effort of five flights of stairs. So if you are walking 10 meters, it's one meter up. It's like a giant gear, basically. So we have a couple of single drummed cranes and we also have a double drummed tread wheel winch. And the advantage of that particular piece of machinery is that it pivots through 360Â°. So that allows us to hoist loads up from the quarry and then spin the machinery around and place it exactly where we need it on the masonry. With the double drum winch we can hoist somewhere in the region of 500 kilos, that's 1,000lb in weight. With a single drum winch, well, there's one person working so it's half, 250 kilos roughly. So I'm going to lift 200 kilos. With this one. All right. 150, 200. Okay. Safety is obviously paramount when we're using this machinery. So we have someone who's responsible for applying the brakes. It means that there's no danger of spinning round like in a washing machine. We have someone who's at the base, responsible for charging the cradle. And then one person who is in charge of the whole operation keeping an eye on how far the walkers still have to walk. Because of course when you're in the machine you can't necessarily see. So it's a very carefully managed process. This is a technology that goes back to Roman times but which is being used in the 13th century in cathedral construction. We know that they were in use because there are a number of medieval cranes that still exist in the roof timbers of cathedrals. Canterbury Cathedral, for example, has a wonderful example of that. Are you going to be on the brake? Does it have a brake? Yes. Look. This is normal brake, you can see here. Yep, it's just friction on that, that... There's no evidence of a braking system on these medieval cranes. For safety reasons we've included one, so that we can stop it if necessary. Strictly speaking, if all is well, you just stop walking. Okay. Okay just go ahead and watch your head. All right. And right now this won't move 'cause you're on the brake, so... You can look at fixed points, to help you. Yeah 'cause if I'm looking at this... Yeah it will be Disneyland! Are you ready? Ready. Okay. Just walk? Walk. Oh! Oh wow. And look to the side. If I look ahead... it gets really confusing. Got to look that way, got to look that way. Hey, but it's working! Yeah, it's working. Oh you're right about that fixed point. Yes. I looked forward for a bit and started getting dizzy. I'm just walking up a steep hill. There is some kind of feedback loop, the faster I walk the faster it turns, then the faster it pushes me back. 'Cause of course I'm moving more. But then I risk bashing my head into the axle behind me. So these machines are absolutely necessary in the construction process. We couldn't build the castle at the rate we are without them. We hoist somewhere in the region of three metric tonnes every day. There we go. Okay. Okay. And stop! Congratulations for your first medieval crane! Thank you. I didn't expect quite the tourist applause there, thank you very much. Always."
205,This is the most interesting roof in London.,"The Royal Albert Hall is one of the most famous and prestigious concert halls in Britain and the world. It's 150 years old, and basically every world famous musician and band has performed here at some point. The trouble is, the science of acoustics wasn't really well developed back in the 19th century. A tall, oval-shaped auditorium with a domed glass roof, well, it looked impressive and regal, but it created an accidental echo chamber, the exact opposite of the focused sound that you'd want for a concert. Beautiful location, terrible sound. To see how they fixed it, we need to go up, to the parts that the public aren't allowed into. It was constructed without any thoughts of acoustics, really, but it was also glazed, it was daylit, naturally lit. The Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII made a speech there at the public opening. Everyone heard his voice twice. So immediately they had to do something to solve the acoustics, and they installed what's called a calico velarium, it's like a sail cloth hung from the roof. It was partially successful, the inner-glazed roof suffered from leakage, broken glass panes as a result of the Second World War, and also daylight really wasn't suitable for a modern hall. The inner glazing of the dome was removed and replaced in 1949 by an aluminium velarium, which is what you see there now. In the late 1960s, the now-iconic ""mushrooms"" were added to the hall. They are suspended, convex diffusers, and they help cut down the echo tremendously. In 2019, the sound system was replaced completely within the hall, and the subjective response, the reaction from audiences, has been absolutely tremendous. This is right at the top of the hall. That is the glass roof, it is 40 meters down to the floor, and just through there is an air vent called the ""corona"", and running across it is a tension steel mesh to let the technicians access it. I am assured by the team here that it is fail-safe and I can walk on it. Guy, hello! Hello, welcome to the corona. Oh, it's a lot cooler in here. [laughing] Must be... oh, I looked down! [laughing] I should not have looked down. I mean, you're health and safety officer here, right? That's right, yeah. You're just casually standing on the mesh? Mm-hm. Yep. Feel free to step out with me. That's a full fear response from me, that. I was going to say, is there anything I can grab onto? I was going toThat's very greasy. So most people hold my hand. Including the fire brigade! [laughing] I was going to ask, like, who has to come out here? Oh my god, it bounces. It bounces. Who has to come out here? Technicians, people who need to put shows on and rigging. Haah, ha-haah. Putting all my weight on that foot is so, so difficult, bloody hell. Oh my god, don't bounce! The weight of the Royal Albert Hall roof, the dead weight of the wrought-iron structure is about 340 tonnes. The roof itself in total can take about a thousand tonnes, inclusive of all permanent and imposed loads, such as wind and snow loading. There is approximately a hundred motorized chain hoists which hang from the original wrought iron structure of the roof, which vary in their load rating, but some can carry up to 1-2 tonnes of show infrastructure. We have lighting rails, which support lighting, sound speakers, as well as the mushrooms which provide the acoustic dampening of the auditorium. The mushrooms, despite their quite substantial size, only weight around 40kg. All of the mushrooms, show infrastructure, speakers, is all hung from the original wrought iron roof structure. I am not sure I can move right now. I'm genuinely... Just look forward, just look forward and walk. Just walk, there's no way you can fall. There's no way you can fall. Just walk, look, just look at the pole, and that's it, you've done it, well done. Thing isCongratulations(!) Thank you. I know it's all my head because the pole is connected exactly the same as this grid is. So this is the corona, the crown, and that is the oculus above us. It's creaking. That's the heat expanding, so temperatures are regularly in the thirties and forties. Typically, whenever there's a fall-from-height risk, the factor of safety on the material properties that would go into the design of the tension wire grid is 5:1, which means there's a fivefold weight allowance of the material property which it can support. But the most surprising thing of all about this roof is not how they fixed the acoustics, it's not this terrifying technicians' trampoline, it's just out there, and the best way to see that is from the outside. I'm going to need a hand, I justFeel free. [Tom gasping] The roof was constructed in full in Manchester and then it was dismantled and reassembled in London through internal scaffold shoring from the inside of the hall. Every beam and element of the wrought iron trusses was then winched up to the top of the roof and then assembled in situ. The shoring was then removed once the roof had been completed in full and dropped by about 5/16ths of an inch or about 8mm, which would've been a heart stopping moment I think for all those involved. All of which leads to the most starting thing for me, the reason I made this video, this roof, this iron and glass dome with all that equipment hanging from it, it's not actually connected to the rest of the building. It's touching, sure, it's resting just here, you can see where the two structures meet, but there's no cement, no bolts, no attachments at all. This dome is just so incredibly heavy that it's not going to move, and it hasn't for 150 years. 600 tons of iron and glass, and a load of Victorian engineering. It doesn't need anything more because anything powerful enough to shift this wouldn't be stopped by a couple of bolts. The roof of the Royal Albert Hall isn't actually attached."
206,Delivering mail by jumping from a moving boat,"This is objectively a bad idea. Delivering mail by having teenagers jump off a moving boat, run down a dock, put the letters in the mailbox, then leap back onto the moving boat before it leaves them behind... it's ridiculous. And not entirely safe? And if someone suggested it as a new thing, now, in the 21st century, it would never be allowed. But ""mail jumping"" is a summer tradition here at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, USA, and it's also a tourist attraction. And today, I'm going to get to see if I'd be any good at it. And it seemed like such a good idea until I put the life jacket on. I have been mail jumping for five summers now. This is my sixth summer at the cruise line in total, but you have to work here for a season, and then you can try out to be a mail jumper. Now, when this started back in 1916 there was about 60 houses on the entire lake and that was the only way they can get mail. We deliver to about that same number, today. We're not postal employees. I'm an employee of the cruise line, where we're contracted to carry the lake mail for that summer season, which is June 15th to September 15th. So in 1916, the predecessor of this company got the mail boat, Walworth, and started that daily, seasonal mail delivery around the lake. As you can imagine, our share of five cents postage from 1916 wouldn't have financed running a boat like this, and some forward-thinking person came up with the idea of making this a passenger-carrying mail boat 'cause that's really what covers the cost of making these deliveries. The mail boat goes out every day at 10am. Even on Sundays, we do the Sunday papers. I do this about three or four days a week and there are six mail jumpers that do this job. If we get a big box to deliver, the captain will usually slow down a little bit just to make sure we don't fall and hurt ourselves. But if the package is too big, we will come to a complete stop. Their shift starts at seven so they start out by cleaning the boat, cleaning the bathrooms, getting all the supplies on board. Paige has to go through and get the newspapers all laid out and put the pier numbers on. So all of these houses have a street address, but we correlate that street address with their pier numbers. We had about 15 kids try out for what ends up being about five or six spots. They're a mail jumper and tour guide. We have them do some of the narration so we can hear that they're articulate, then we have them do some jumps. They have to be somebody that's pretty athletic, but we let the tryouts pretty much sort that out. So I actually fell in when I tried out for mail jumping, but they let me do it again and get a second chance. So I got to redeem myself. You kind of just have to be confident. Don't hesitate when you're jumping, because that's when you're going to slip and fall and get hurt. Before we set off, I did get some advice from today's mail jumper. So leaping off, do I need to match speed with the dock or anything like that? It's not so much about speed. Okay. It's just making sure that you're not running at the boat, because otherwise you're just going to crash right into it. So the jump off, when I'm leaving the boat, it's just, there's the dock. Try not to break your leg? Or... Yeah! Okay! Don't try to jump and stop because you're going to be moving again obviously. So try to like run it out a little bit, as we say, also. And then it's just, so it's jump, run, run, run, run, run. Thing in the mailbox. It's going to be right there for you. Put it in. Run, run, run and then? Turn. And then take a few steps, you know, with the boat. Okay. So try and match vaguely some speed with the boat. And then it's leap and grab. Yes. Okay. I'm going to say the words. How hard can it be? Let's do it. So I have fallen in the lake a few times. Not so recently, though. On the average, probably once a week or so, somebody will go in the lake. Most of the time when they miss, they miss coming back onto the boat. So somebody's outgoing mail might get wet. We've got a little pool skimmer down below. If we have to, we've had somebody lean out the door and scoop stuff back up out of the lake. The safety vests that they wear are self-inflating. The moment they get wet, bang, they blow up. Every pier that we deliver to has a ladder on it. [chuckles] And so when they miss, they get themselves back on the pier and I come back around. You know, you don't back up to somebody that's in the water. They jump back on, they wring out their socks and we keep on going. They know that their mail might get wet, someday. They know that their outgoing mail might have tooth marks on it. I think this is a great summer job. It's really fun. I like being out here on the lake. Being out in the sun every day. Right, my turn. The tourists have left. The team here are just giving me the same test that they give to anyone trying out for this job. It's just that the people who try out are usually half my age and twice as athletic. So, you know, what could go wrong? I'll promise this. I'm only giving myself one attempt. If I nail this, you'll see it. If I miss the boat or chicken out on the jump back, you'll also see it. This is all I need to do. You made that look so easy. [laughing] I like that you took the time to kiss the goose, like, that was style points. This isn't actual mail, right? This is justYeah. That's just a extra newspaper for you. Let's do it. I just realized that I'm still wearing my microphone, so I really do not want to miss this jump. Okay, so when do I start going out? I can start. Yeah, you can go ahead and climb out. You can get on the ledge there. There's a little stirrup here that you can put your left foot into, 'til you get ready to go all the way out. All right. [laughing] The nerves just kicked in. You got it. And I want to lead with my right leg out, left leg back. Okay. Oh, this is fast. This is so much faster than I thought it was. [yells] Okay, whoa. Oh, he did it. Yes! Yay, that was a good one. That was terrifying. [all laughing] Of all the ridiculous stuff I've done. The bit that scared me the most was the landing. Just not knowing, am I going to just collapse forward? Oh, there's the goose, okay. I don't want to do that again. How many times do you do that, Paige? 40, 50 times, yeah. Thank you so much. Uh, Lake Geneva mail boat tours. Link's in the description. My heart's going!"
207,A geyser that shoots sparkling mineral water,"The town of Soda Springs, Idaho, in the USA, lives up to its name. Because here in Geyser Park, in the center of town, there is a geyser that shoots soda water up into the sky. As in: carbonated water, seltzer, sparkling water, whatever you want to call it. The stuff you'd find in a bottle. The geyser here isn't boiling, that's not steam. Underneath the town, there's a natural reservoir of carbonated mineral water. But while the water is natural, the geyser is manmade and accidental. 1937, a group of local businessmen started talking about a pool for Soda Springs, and they started drilling. They were about out of money and about out of eight-inch pipe. They were down 315 feet. And they quit for the evening. They were having dinner, and they heard this loud noise. They saw this column of water shooting into the air and a crowd gathering. The businesses downtown were getting kind of anxious because water was going everywhere. It was in the middle of December. And then they had to figure out how to cap it. It took them about two weeks. When they stopped drilling, they were right next to the water, but they were in a pocket of COâ gas and as they stopped, they combined, and that formed the pressure that released it. The COâ gas also cooled the water to where it was not hot enough for a swimming pool. Turns out natural carbonated water is a thing that happens in a few places around the world where there's underground water and carbon dioxide held at pressure. The geyser wasn't a complete surprise. ...I mean, in the moment, it probably was, but the town had already been called Soda Springs for decades, because there were natural carbonated springs near here that you could bathe in. The first English-language accounts date from the days of the Oregon Trail, which passed through this area, although the springs were used well before European settlers ever got to the area. The pioneers would pick the warm springs out to do laundry, and they would mix their flour to make their bread with the soda springs. Because they didn't need yeast and their bread would rise. And of the hundreds of springs that were here when the early pioneers came through, there are five that I know of left that have soda water. The majority of those springs were covered up in 1923 when they built the Alexander Dam. The rest of them... spring was in the way, it got filled in and covered over. At one time, they bottled the water. Not from any of the springs the city has, but they bottled it and sold it worldwide. So when this thing started, it wasn't so much a geyser as it was a blown-out well, putting out enough water to flood parts of the town with seltzer. The entire underground reservoir was pushing up through the borehole. The geyser ran continuously for a while and the officials at the Park must have said something about some irregularities in Old Faithful. And the Secretary of the Interior sent a telegram to the city offices telling them to shut the geyser off immediately and notify them they had done that. So they did. And then it was determined that had no impact on the geyser basin. And so they gave them back the permission to operate the geyser. When I was a boy in the 1960s, a city employee would go into a little shed where the control for the valve was and manually turn the valve on and manually turn it off. If the wind was blowing towards town, he was not supposed to turn it on. Now they have a electronic timer and it goes off every hour on the hour. Someone realized that if they put a timer valve on their new geyser, well, that could be a pretty good tourist attraction. And the result is this colossal 20 meter eruption, for eight minutes, on the hour, every hour. All the orange stuff around it is travertine, mineral deposits that have built up over the years, because this is mineral water. You don't want to park your car where it might get overspray from the geyser, because of the mineral in the water. If you did that over time, you'd have a real problem getting that hard water off. Some of the graves on the northeast corner of the cemetery have been impacted by the overspray, as has the walkway around it. It's all coated in a rock. The headstones, some of them are not readable anymore. The town's publicity says that this is the world's only captive geyser. That does depend on how you define it. There's a couple of places in Germany that would probably take issue with that. It does seem to be the only one in America. And as far as I can tell, it's the only one on a regular timer, where the public can just turn up and watch for no admission fee. And I know the obvious question is, what does that water taste like? I could try and stand over there with a glass for the next eruption, catch the water, get soaked, but I don't need to. Because at Octagon Springs on the other side of the railway tracks, the city has thoughtfully provided a little ramp, and you can just get a glass. That's really nice. I don't know what I was expecting. That's just nice, lightly carbonated water. It's not too fizzy. That's... I would happily buy that in a bottle."
208,It's a pile of mining waste. Want to go skiing on it?,"If a company is mining something, there are usually byproducts, the stuff that's left behind after extraction and processing. And these days, the mining company should be required to deal with those byproducts, but in the past they often just piled them up and assumed someone would deal with the problem at some point in the future. If those byproducts are toxic, thatâs a problem. But here in Hirschau, in Germany, it's a bit different. Just over there is an open-pit kaolin mine: kaolin is a really common mineral that's used in the manufacture of a lot of things, everything from pottery to toothpaste. And there is a big pile of mining byproduct here. I'm standing on it, it is 120 metres high. But it's just sand. Regular sand. Made of quartz, like what you'd find in the desert. Quartz sand can be useful in industry. These days the sand that the mines produce here is sold off. But for decades there was too much of it, so as it was pretty harmless, the mining companies just piled it up. What do you do with 35 million tons of sand, in a pile that's dominating the landscape? The answer, of course, is make it a tourist attraction. Welcome to the ski resort and amusement park of Mount Kaolino. I should point out â itâs 9am on a weekday as Iâm filming this, so there arenât many people around, it's not fully open. In the summer school holidays, this place is as busy as a regular ski slope would be in high season. IN GERMAN:       A lot of this hill is covered in trees and other vegetation, and they will help anchor the sand and keep everything in place. So I had to ask: surely all the people descending this mountain keep dragging the sand down with them? I'm sure that the local government could have insisted that this hill be cleaned up and the sand disposed of somehow. But why would they? Now, Hirschau isn't just a mining town. It's a mining town with a local theme park. Tourists have a reason to come here, and spend money. There are more jobs for the locals. And every so often, someone will come along and tell the world that, hey, there's a ski slope made of sand in Germany. No, I... I can't sandboard, I would die. This is not the hill to learn on! I'm going to take the little cable car down. How do I... I'm genuinely terrified I'm going to slip off this! How do I get out of this? That tightened it! Oh my god, okay."
209,Maybe rich people should build weird fountains again,"Okay, hear me out. If you have enormous amounts of money, the right thing to do with it is to help other people and the world. Obviously. But very rich people will likely spend some money showing off, and I canât help feeling that if that is going to happen, then it might be nice if things like this came back into fashion. In English, the word ""water feature"" seems almost quaint. It implies a small fountain in a back yard or a little stream running down to a pond, some little babbling-brook diversion to break up a suburban garden. But the German translation for that is ""wasserspiele"": literally, ""water-games"". And if you were very rich German nobility 300 years ago, water-games might include a massive hillside park, a seven-tonne, eleven-metre-high statue of Hercules, and a fountain that reaches fifty metres high. This is the Water Games of Bergpark WilhelmshÃ¶he in Germany, it's now a World Heritage Site. The fountains and water features here are powered by gravity, and controlled on-demand by hidden mechanisms in underground pipelines, some of which are centuries old. IN GERMAN:       By the time you see this video, the Wasserspiele will be open to the public for the summer season. But today, they are just testing. A few lucky tourists were in the right place at the right time, but the team here didnât announce this was happening. Except, they sort of did, because first, there was big release of water at the top and the cascades that go half way down the hill. And I really wasnât expecting the noise. [LOUD HONK] [PITCH AND VOLUME CONTINUE RISING] [horn fades] The rushing water brings a lot of air with it, and thatâs forced through the trumpets that the Herald statues hold. The noise is immense, itâs a siren that for 300 years has told anyone in the park that the water games are about to begin. The water goes through a series of stations, each a few minutes' walk apart, and at each station the water is released manually, at a certain time, one after the other. After the cascades, thereâs the artificial waterfalls, and then the bridge, which leads to the colossal aqueduct, wind and spray all blowing around from the force of the water. And the crowds of people whoâll be coming to watch this summer will follow along, walking the path, waiting for the water to be released and for each show to begin. So I assumed that this was basically one big river with some engineering in the way. But this was built in several parts, by several different landowners, so of course, it's more complicated than that. And it all ends here, at the fifty-metre fountain. Now, Iâm not saying that building things like this should be a higher priority for rich people than feeding or housing the world, or any other philanthropy. Of course. And okay, maybe not fountains, maybe some other big physical art stuff. But I canât help feeling that if someone is going to spend huge amounts on vanity projects to show off their wealth to the worldâ¦ why not make them spectacular, and fun, and built to last for centuries?"
210,I rode a giant mechanical elephant. You can too.,"There are a lot of artists and companies around the world that build big moving structures for art. There are plenty of stage shows, theme park attractions, and arena tours, which need massive mechanical stuff to move around. Here in Nantes, in the west of France, though, there's one place that builds things slightly differently. Les Machines de l'Ã®le, the island machines, are best known for their giant mechanical elephant. 12 meters high, weighing 48 tons, it regularly ""goes for a walk"" around the city. But the big difference here is: this offers rides to tourists. Unlike a lot of theme park attractions, not only does the elephant have to put on four shows a day, it has to put on those shows safely with people of all ages on board. The two creators started this because... they could! There was a desire from the mayor to renovate all this place and the project fitted very well. The elephant was constructed at first in 2004, from 2004 to 2007, about 30 months of construction. All the machine that have been made for the project of Les machines de l'Ã®le used wood, stainless steel, and leather, mainly these three. We use plastic on some parts, but very few, because we don't want to use plastic as much as we can. We have hybrid motorization that will power the elephant through the two back wheels. For the legs of the elephants, many people think that they're making it walk, but if they touch the ground, they do not push him forward. The elephant works as an automaton. For the movement of the head or the ears, the eyes, and also the trunk, they are all programmed in a computer. You have 44 hydraulic cylinders on the machine, 6 gas cylinders, and finally, 4 pneumatic cylinders. To make the elephant move, we need at least two people, one pilot, and one guide inside the elephant to assure the safety of people inside, but also to make the scream of the elephant. We may have about 200, 300 people around the elephant moving with him during his walk, but we always keep a security perimeter of about five-meter distance between the front wheel and the crowd. The elephant is about 48 tons, so it could be very risky for anyone to get under a leg. Safety here makes a lot more sense when you get close up. Yes, there are a lot of moving parts, particularly, in the middle. We're not allowed to film, but you don't get close to them. The same way if you're riding on a bus, you can't actually get close to the engine or the wheels. Ultimately, this is a slow and weirdly shaped bus. You can stand up on a bus or a train going 50, 100 times the speed with much sharper acceleration and braking. Now there are places that would've made getting on board an exclusive experience, and honestly, if I was in charge of a show like this, I'd be tempted to say that... [elephant screams] yes, maybe a few people can ride, but we'll charge them â¬100 each and it's restricted only to VIPs. [elephant continues screaming] That way... [laughs] That way, it's much less of a hassle. [scream ends] But a ride on this elephant is less than â¬10. They have a boarding procedure like an airport and there are 50 passengers allowed on board. The most impressive part of this whole thing for me is not that it works. It's that it works to theme park standards show after show, day after day, year after year in the real world with people on board, and it's not the only attraction here. This place is the older warehouse, the old workshop of the division shipyards. Inside the gallery, we have a lot of machines. We have a caterpillar, we have a heron, we have a spider, all giant machines. We have also smaller machines. During the visit, we take randomly a visitor to take part on a trip on the machine, or to move several parts of the machine during the presentation. Every machinist needs training of about one month and a half to move every machine inside the gallery. The most difficult to move is the spider, because it works as an excavator. It's very complicated, as you move two diggers at the same time. After the spider, the other most complicated machine should be the little heron. ""Little"" is a euphemism, because it's about 7.5 meters wingspan and about 3 meters high. We have a lot of parts to move, especially the wings. The Sea World carousel is a carousel about 25 meters high. Inside you find 36 machines, where you can go inside and take a turn. The machines are inspired of fantastic worlds or real sea fish. A lot of workshops and art projects like this can struggle to pay the rent. Charging people for rides and admission is a great way to make big art like this sustainable. Between the elephant, the gallery, and the carousel, this is basically a small theme park now, but more than that, it's affected the reputation of the whole town. Some of the funding for building that elephant and all of this came from local government as part of a deliberate attempt to change the city's image and make it somewhere more appealing to tourists. The question, ""why would you want to visit Nantes?"" now has an answer: because there's nowhere else you can ride a giant mechanical elephant and still have change from â¬10."
211,You're not allowed in this cave. But there's a copy.,"Somewhere in the hills just over there is the Chauvet cave. It was discovered in 1994, and inside is artwork that's around 30,000 years old, some of the best-preserved cave paintings anywhere in the world. It's a connection to ancestors who lived tens of millennia before history began. Only a lucky few people are ever allowed in that cave, and almost all of them are scientific researchers and conservators. There's no way that some guy with a camera is ever going to get in there.  ...right? The Chauvet cave is the oldest painted cave we know of. The cave has been rediscovered the 19th of December 1994. It has been a tremendous discovery. It has pretty much changed everything we thought until then. Roughly 1,000 representations, paintings, drawings, engravings. The engravings are white in color, the paintings are red, and the drawings, which are made with charcoal, are black. This isn't the real cave. It's a replica called Chauvet 2. When I say replica, I don't just mean the art, but the shapes of the cave walls that it's painted on were laser scanned and recreated. Cavers and historians would be able to pick up things that give it away, like the suspiciously well-maintained lighting, but to a layperson, this is roughly the experience you'd get standing in the original Chauvet cave if it had been turned into a tourist attraction, complete with a lot of other exhibits outside. So my question is: if you can replicate something this accurately, how much does it matter that it's not the original? The original cave was scanned several times, so we've gathered a point cloud that was made of 16 billion points. The original Chauvet cave takes roughly 500 meters to get from the entrance to the end of the cave, so it is really huge. In the original cave, you could walk for five, six, seven minutes and see nothing. It would have been a waste to recreate the cave as it was because the point was to make it more accessible, so it has been reduced. If there's something that we did not change, it's just the drawings themselves, the representations. They're where they're supposed to be, you see them in the order that you're supposed to see them in the original cave. If at some point we've changed sizes of some rooms, we did not touch the walls on which the paintings and the drawings were made. They're exactly in the same place in the very same shape as the original ones. The walls are concrete and for the finer details such as bones, stalactite, stalagmite, and so on, it is resin modelled to the shape of the original cave. The art is recreated by hand. They have been made as precisely as could humanly be possible. To the millimeter, actually. They did not only do it by hand, but they did use the same, the very same type of wood to make the charcoal. The paintings, the reddish paintings, they're made of hematite, the same type of rock that was used by the prehistoric painters. Tourists aren't allowed in the original cave for very good reasons. That lesson was learned at Lascaux, another cave a few hours west of here, that was also filled with prehistoric art. It was discovered in 1940, and it was opened as a tourist attraction, which destroyed it. Not completely, but: the presence of 1,000 people a day and the changes in temperature, and humidity, and carbon dioxide levels, and contaminants that all of them brought along, well, it meant that after tens of thousands of years of stability, bacteria, fungi, and algae took over the walls. Despite desperate conservation efforts through the 20th century, the Lascaux cave will never ever be what it once was. The prehistoric entrance of the Chauvet cave is sealed off. Tonnes and tonnes of rock that collapsed right on the entrance and sealed it off. All the people, all the animals that got inside of the cave during prehistoric times, they cannot possibly enter the cave anymore, and it has been so for at least 21,000 years. The fact that the cave has been isolated from the outside world, it made the atmosphere very stable which allowed the paintings and the drawings to be preserved the way they are. -The trouble is, tourists like visiting the real places. There is something about actually being there, about standing exactly where an ancestor painted on a wall, and this cave can't provide that. But it isn't a Disney World mock-recreation, it's pretty accurate, and just a few kilometers away from the original. The sights, the physical sensations are close, except you don't have to be harnessed in and climb down a big ladder to get here. If the original cave had been open to tourists, it would have been changed, maybe devastated. Would this feel the same if someone built this replica in Paris, or in London, or Sydney? How much does the context of the experience matter? How important is authenticity? I don't have the answers to any of that, but I can say that a few times while I've walked around here even with the rational knowledge, that it's not the same place, even knowing that I will exit through the gift shop, For a few seconds, a bit of my brain was fooled. Although, maybe that's because I got to be in here alone after hours. Either way, I do like one idea, that in another 30,000 years' time, some future archeologist is going to be really confused by two identical caves next to each other. The huge amount of painted caves we've discovered yet, all the art they've left us, it shows us that those societies were in good health because if they did have time to do all of this, it's because they had free time. It shows they do have a life, they do have culture, they do have art as we do today. They might have not done it for the very same reason, but they do have it. It shows that they do not just merely survive, they live."
212,Europe's toughest airport landing used to be a lot harder,"Funchal Airport, on the island of Madeira, is one of the most difficult places in Europe to land a commercial plane. It wasn't easy to build a runway here back in the 1960s. Madeira is basically one huge mountain just sticking out of the Atlantic Ocean. There isn't any part of this island flat enough for long enough that it can support a runway. But with a lot of earthmoving, it was possible for them to build one short runway, enough for the relatively lightweight aircraft of the day. And then European tourism and the package holiday boom started, and planes kept getting bigger. The runway was extended another 200 meters in the '70s, but it still wasn't enough. There was nowhere to extend to. There was another bit of cliff, a few hundred meters to the east, that could technically be flattened. But between there and the existing runway, there was nothing but air. The only option was to build a bridge: big enough, wide enough and strong enough, somehow, to handle a fully loaded airliner landing on it. Basically: to put most of the runway up on stilts. So that's what they did. IN PORTUGUESE:     It's only when you get underneath the runway and stand up close that you realise the sheer scale of this. It's unlike any other space I've ever been in. There's a whole boatyard under here, a go kart track. The noise you can hear is industry. There's more than 30 metres between each of these pillars. The tallest ones are more than 50 metres high. Just the base of each pillar is taller than I am. The foundations go far down into the ground. This whole area had to be flattened and stabilised so it could stand up to the weight. On its own, a runway on stilts shouldn't make a landing more difficult. A runway is a runway, right? The difficulty comes from what's around and under it. The mountains cause fast gusting winds. And the approach has a late, low turn that requires special training. And pilots aren't even allowed to start that training until they've had 200 hours flying the type of aircraft they'll be landing here. In the airport documentation, there's a line that says pilots should watch the wind indicators on the runway because occasionally, ""they will indicate wind from opposite directions"". To be clear, this is safe. There hasn't been an incident on this runway in nearly half a century. For most passengers, this is just a normal landing at a normal airport. Or at worst, a bit of a bumpy, turbulent landing. And the reason for that is a lot of pilot training and some very big civil engineering."
213,"Downhill, on a couch, on public roads.","Across Europe, there are lots of strange tourist attractions that started out as useful public transport infrastructure. Venice has its gondolas. Lots of cities have cable cars and funicular railways. And Funchal, here, the capital of Madeira, has the basket carts. They are wooden toboggans on smooth runners that are powered by people in straw hats pushing them. And, uh, there aren't any seatbelts. From the start, they used the sledges to bring some wood from the mountains to the town by the sea. After that, they adapt for tourists. In total, we are 154 men. We have about 60 baskets running most of the day. The toboggan is made of wood, normal wood. And if it sticks to the floor, we put some grease under the basket and it slides much better. We have a workshop where we fix the baskets, and we build new ones. And we keep rotating the baskets. (IN PORTUGUESE:)      "
214,The bridge that must legally wobble,"Officially, this suspension bridge over the River Lee, in Cork, in the south of Ireland, is called ""Daly's Bridge"", after a businessman who helped fund it back in the 1920s. But unofficially, it has a different name: the Shakey Bridge. Because it shakes. I was going to film this with my GoPro on a stick walking across, but it's a really narrow bridge, and I don't want to end up barging into the people who are actually using it. I can confirm from a brief experiment, though... Yep. It's bouncy! In the early 1700s, there was a ferry boat that actually brought people from here across to the other side. But unfortunately between 1906 and 1908, the Dooley family actually retired, retired themselves from the ferry boat industry. And it was through the philanthropy of a man called James Daly, who gave nearly Â£700 towards the construction of a bridge project. Â£700 in today's terms would be around â¬50,000. And to be honest, you would not be able to build a bridge in today's world for â¬50,000. So the bridge was good value. David Rowell and Company, in London, Westminster, actually had a bridge catalogue. And the Corporation of Cork bought a bridge off the catalogue, and in early 1927 these huge, giant wooden boxes arrived on the banks of the River Lee. And the bridge actually was constructed. So in the first couple of months the people of the area discovered that the bridge actually shook when they walked over it. Now, all suspension bridges, actually, pretty much all bridges, will move or shake or sway a little as the dynamic loads on them from people and weather change. And that's a good thing: because if they don't move a little... ...they break. The design of this bridge meant the shake was more obvious. It bounces up and down. And it probably wasn't intentional(!) But clearly it wasn't dangerous, as proven by the fact that the bridge stood for 90 years, taking all the jumping around and abuse that local children, and adults, could throw at it. But nothing lasts forever. In 2017, an inspection looked at the corrosion and damage that had accumulated over the years on the bridge. And, well, it'd been built to last with good materials. But we're near the ocean here, and 90 years of salty air and shaking meant that the metal had corroded, and wires had broken and frayed. The report said, in short: the bridge had about three years before it had to be closed, and repairs were needed immediately. So it was repaired. Not rebuilt: the engineers reused or matched materials as far as possible. They took the deck of the bridge apart, fixed it up off-site, and then put it back together, taking care to keep the height and positioning the same. They replaced the suspension cables with brand new ones, and repaired the towers where they stood. And they gave the bridge a fresh coat of paint. But here's the problem. This bridge is on the local Record of Protected Structures. It must be maintained and repaired, but it also can't be changed. There was public consultation, and of course many people actually wrote in, going ""keep the shake, keep the shake, keep the shake, keep the shake"". And in fairness to the engineers who worked on the project, I think they did achieve that. People have had a lot of fun walking across the bridge, admiring the river, jumping on it. Like, this has been ongoing for 90 years. Before the work started, the engineers used accelerometers to measure how the bridge responded to someone jumping right in the middle. And they found that the bridge bounces up and down at about 2.3 cycles a second. So as part of the design process, they used computer modelling to work out how the new cables would behave. And they made sure to keep the bridge's total mass as close as possible to how it was before. Bridges shake and twist in three dimensions, of course, it's not just up-and-down. But up-and-down is the direction you feel the most when you're standing up there! And all the data showed that, in all three dimensions, the repaired the repaired Shakey Bridge was moving more or less as it did before. There was a slight change. But arguably that just took it closer to how it shook when it was brand new, nearly a century earlier. The bridge now goes up and down at 2.2 cycles a second. It would have been entirely possible, with modern technology and materials, to build an identical looking bridge that was much more stable. Normally, that's what engineers do: they try to damp down vibrations. But in this one case, their job was to keep things the same. Fixing the shake would not have been preservation. The goal here was to repair this bridge so that it can survive, and shake the residents of Cork for another century to come."
215,The giant archive hidden under the British countryside,"I got several emails to set up today's video. So the first part is: there is a massive archive hidden in a working salt mine in the north of England. And the second part is: it's not just for documents. Because there's so much space available, it's also an archive for actual physical objects, for ""stuff"". Now it's very rare that someone who is not an employee or an archive client is allowed down here, particularly to make a video. Because there are public records, important government archives, and a lot of things that I'm not allowed to go near, let alone film. Confidentiality is important, and someone is looking over my camera op's shoulder to check where that lens is pointing. We are 150 metres underground and about a kilometre into that mine... is DeepStore. Ready when you are! The area that the mine occupies is around 3.5km east to west, and about 2.5km north to south. And at the moment we're about 1.5km away from the mining activities. We use what's called a ""room and pillar"" mining technique. We don't just extract great big massive voids of salt. There are massive pillars of salt, of which I'm actually stood next to one now, which make the mine so stable and support the roof. So where DeepStore comes in is: we actually build inbetween these pillars, and in-between these pillars is what we call the repositories, or the rooms. And then we plane the floors, they're painted, we install the racking, we install the air conditioning. Originally, the mining started around about 1850 and it really got going around the turn of the century, 1900. Since then, it's simply grown and grown and grown up to the present day where now we're extracting around a million tonnes each year. DeepStore was set up in the 1990s because we've got the perfect atmosphere down here to store items. The salt creates a naturally occurring dry atmosphere. And of course with the racking, nothing naturally comes into contact with the salt. Because this is relatively a shallow mine, we're around 150 metres, 400-500 feet, and because of the salt bed, it has created this natural ambient temperature of 14-15Â° along with a relative humidity of 53-55%, which anybody in the archive and storage world knows, naturally occurring, that is absolutely fantastic. What we've been able to do is actually enhance these conditions and modify them even more to client requirements. So by the use of air conditioning and air filtration, we can make the atmosphere in here to really whatever a client requires. The atmosphere in these storage rooms is actually clearer than it is on the surface. It's almost impossible to get across the sheer scale of the mine and the archive on camera. And out there, where it's still a working mine, I can taste salt in the air, there's clouds of it that lands on you. But in here, things are a little bit more controlled. It is public knowledge that somewhere in the many, many vaults here, there are files from the British National Archives and core samples drilled out for soil tests during the construction of Crossrail. Other than that, well, DeepStore aren't saying. More through wanting to be cautious about revealing details of their clients, rather than any strict secrecy. But the folks who actually got in touch and invited me here have a very different reason for storing actual physical things long-term. Laura Ashley is a UK interiors lifestyle and fashion brand. Within the cabinets in this room, there are hand drawn artworks, some of them hundreds of years old that have been developed into wallpapers or fabrics. But we also have fabrics, dresses, rolls of wallpaper, metres of the fabric that we've produced over the years stored in the archive. It's a continually growing archive for Laura Ashley. It's really important for us to archive the original physical pieces. So we can really understand, it's those techniques of how they were made. If you scanned that, if you created a digital archive, you would lose that history to that piece. When you can touch and feel and see some of these amazing antique documents, you can really see the brushstrokes in the artwork or how they were printed initially. And it might be that we actually want to recreate how they were printed, not just how they look. We can't keep everything. It would be nice if entropy didn't exist, but until humanity fixes that, preservation and archiving will take skill, time, and money. And the more you preserve, the more upkeep it takes. Perhaps the most important decision any archivist has to make is what to keep and what to throw away. So we've got almost a hundred thousand items in this Laura Ashley archive, but that is by no means everything that was ever manufactured. We will always keep masters so wallpaper and fabric is core to what Laura Ashley is. Original artworks would never be thrown away. The Laura Ashley pieces in this archive date back to the really early period. So people may donate pieces to the Laura Ashley archive, that could be a Laura Ashley bowl that you used to have in your house in the 1980s or your mum's wedding dress from the 1970s. It's fantastic for us to be able to see that we're following in the footsteps of the people who came before us. We've got over three and a half million of items under storage, be it a box or be it an artefact. We have more than 40 rooms of the same standard or even better standard than what I'm actually standing in now. This is probably one of the largest single repositories in the country. Currently, we occupy 14 to 15% of the actual mined void area underground, which means we've got amazing amounts of space to expand into. I mean, really, if you were to convert this entire site, eventually you'd probably be able to store just about every single archive box in Europe."
216,"After 140 years, this old technology still keeps trains safe","140 years ago, the Callander and Oban railway, in the south-west of Scotland, set up a rockfall detection system along four miles of remote hillside railway track. The astonishing thing is: that system is still in operation today, 140 years later. And so far no one's been able to come up with anything better. The West Highland lines travel hundreds of miles along natural mountainsides. There are different hazards depending on where you are on the Scottish rail network. Through the Falls of Cruachan, the hazards there are definitely rockfall and boulder fall. We're now at Bridge of Orchy on the West Highland line and the hazards here are much more natural landslides and debris flows down the steep-sided mountains. Rocks that are very small can pose a risk to the train operations. So something as small as a microwave can cause a train a problem. Something as big as a washing machine could lead to derailment  so it is a really serious issue. Definitely stopping the hazard at source is the best option for us. In a typical year we will spend somewhere in the region of Â£40 million, and that's on things that prevent landslides or improve the resilience of our infrastructure to extreme weather. Thank you very much! So Scotland's railway is about 3,500 track-miles. So we can't protect that whole length, so we need to look at other ways of keeping the trains safe, which is where the rockfall detection comes in. By modern standards, it's a really basic system. There's no electricity. Just these wires along the track, held under tension, mechanically linked to the signals. If a big boulder falls down, it hits a wire, the wire snaps, the tension's released, and the signal at each end of that bit of wire changes to show danger. Repeat for 17 signals over the four miles of railway. The system was nicknamed Anderson's Piano after its inventor and after the humming noises that the wires sometimes make in high winds. Anderson's Piano is a very old system, 140 years. Keeping something like that going in a modern environment, it is quite challenging. Firstly, I guess there's the knowledge. There's not a user manual or a downloadable book on how to maintain Anderson's Piano. We need to pass that down through generations of technicians and engineers. And then there's just getting hold of the kit. A lot of it was bespoke, made in foundries in the Victorian era. Some of it we've had to improvise. Some of it is just availability of material. So getting hold of some of the wire can be quite challenging. And we think we've managed to find a reasonable source that is a good enough match. The kind of rural fence that will use that kind of wire, the manufacturers are striving to make it stronger and stronger and we don't need it stronger for Anderson's piano. We need it to break when there's a rock comes through it. It's not perfect detection in terms of screening out. So vegetation can trip it off, animal movements if they do get inside the boundary. Very manual to reset. It's a physical task that involves lifting weights and repositioning counterbalances and manually moving signals back into place. So we can't do that when the trains are running, so that's disruptive to our network. It's a physical job that involves human beings. There's not a big reset button that we can push. The first we know there's a problem is when the signal goes up and normally the first person to see that is the train driver. We are not able to respond someone to the problem when it occurs. We need to wait until after it's occurred, because the first time we know about it is when a driver tells us. Modern rail safety rules mean that ideally, no one should ever drive a train past a signal that's set to danger. If that is ever needed because of a fault somewhere, it requires checking and double checking with central control. If a train goes past a danger signal without permission, there's always an investigation. If it was because the driver was negligent, it can end their career. But the rules for these signals have to be different, and they go against everything that a modern train driver learns. If these signals are at danger, you slow the train down to walking pace, to a speed where you will be able to stop before you hit any obstruction, and you radio it into central control... but you do continue. And that would never be allowed on a new system. It's offering us a level of protection, so there's a line of defence there that works quite a lot of the time. It would be less safe without it. Prevention is better than detection, so stopping the rocks falling is definitely better than detecting them when they have occurred. So we put a great deal of effort into containing some of the rocks on our cuttings and into catching boulders through high-strength, high-capacity catch fences that are anchored into the rock. We employ all sorts of techniques like netting, and meshing, and doweling to hold all the rock in place. We're constantly looking for technology to improve safety on the railway. Satellite technology that looks for ground movement from space, and does change detection on that. We've tried ""listening fibres"" through fibre-optic cables that listen for an acoustic signature of a rock falling or a tree falling on the railway. The cost of that equipment is starting to come down. We're starting to see advances in technology which is making it more affordable to deploy. But one of the big issues is actually power. These things will either need a power supply, which in remote places can be hard to come by, or they'll run off batteries and solar panels which need to have sufficient capacity to keep them up all year round. Scottish winters can be quite dark. Some of our trials have been hampered by false alerts and false alarms and too many false alerts to run a railway. At Bridge of Orchy we've got some detectors in place to capture any movement. Now, they're the wireless tilt meters that tell us if the ground's moving. Like your spirit level on your iPhone that moves about, they will detect a bit of movement and we will get an alert or an alarm remotely from that. We've then got a camera on site that we can see the site to see whether it's a false alarm or not, so we're not needlessly stopping trains. We've got some infrared kit on there so that we can see at nighttime. Then infrared reflectors to see if there's been a problem during the hours of darkness as well. It's all remote back to base and it only requires a technician in our control centre to watch that and monitor that. It's also less prone to false alarms and we can reset it at the touch of a button. So we know about it before the train comes, we can capture the problem before it manifests itself on the railway, and we can remotely reset it and remotely monitor it. We do an awful lot, but it's not enough to go everywhere. And, you know, we can't physically protect every mile of railway. It's just impracticable. From talking to the folks here, I'd say that the best description of these signals is that they are a frustrating, imperfect system that's still better than nothing. Back when I was researching this video, I figured that there must be a better solution, and with all the confidence of someone in the YouTube comments who's only watched half the video, I thought, ""Hey, couldn't they just?..."" And no. They can't, at least not yet. [train rumbling] How's that for timing?!"
217,"The Elie Chainwalk is safe, as long as you follow the signs","This windswept beach in the south-east of Scotland is open to the public. But to get here, there's a bit of effort required. [waves crash] That is part of the Elie Chainwalk, 500 metres long, made up of eight chains anchored into the cliff face, along with some carved foot and handholds. It was set up in the 1920s, likely to help local fishermen get down the cliffs to their boats. A century later it's maintained as a local attraction and as optional side trip on the local coast path, which means that in any weather, even on very blustery, ill-advised, freezing days like this, you can just scramble along the Chain Walk as if it was any other public footpath. Now, you should not do this alone. I've got a local guide with me. Thank you, Allan. And before we set off, I asked him about how all this works. It's open to the public, completely open access all year round. You do need a certain level of physical ability. You're putting a lot of your weight onto your arms. There's a couple of chains you have to climb and descend from a reasonably high height. So although it's technically not difficult, you do have to be cautious climbing at height. But if you come here in the summer, you'll see families tackling the chains, but also groups come here with helmets and harnesses, and so on. A wide range of people come and give the chains a go. Very occasionally, people do fall here. Perhaps because they've ignored safety signs, or strayed off the path, or been trapped by the tide and had to call out the local lifeboat. The Chain Walk isn't massively dangerous, it's not just for climbing experts, but it is dangerous enough that the safety signs are justified. There are modern attractions like this all over the world but they generally use harness systems, instead of ""hold on tight and watch out for the tide"". The Chain Walk sits in that strange group of lesser-known places where it would never be created now. But it does exist, and no-one wants to get rid of it. It was repaired about ten years ago after someone stole the chains, and every six months engineers come out to check that everything is still anchored in, safe and intact. One thing you might notice: that some of the fixing points move. So quite often, we'll have people reporting them in, but that's actually meant to be like that. There's meant to be a little bit of movement so it doesn't stress the rock as much. I've been coming here and leading groups here for about 30 years. Plan ahead. And secondly, come prepared. Decent footwear, know the tides, know what the weather's going to be like so that you don't get surprised as you go along the chains. There have been reports of people falling. They see the tide, they feel trapped. They don't want to get wet, so they decide to climb up the cliffs. But if you know the tides, and if you plan around that then that's not going to happen. When I first came here, it was the original chains which were old and rusty. The ones there now are quite new and shiny and solid. And what I love most about this is the Chain Walk doesn't really lead anywhere important. You go across some cliffs, down a bit, across, up again, and you get access to a couple of beaches that are pretty much like every other beach around here. People do this, people take a small but significant risk and take the Chain Walk for no other reason than... it's there."
218,This town forgot to be a city,"It is a very windy day here here in Rochester, in the south-east of England, and the only place I could find to film where my tripod wasn't getting blown over was sheltered here by the castle walls, so apologies that the background isn't quite as picturesque as it usually is. I've got a story for you. I actually cut three whole paragraphs from the start of my script for this. 'Cos I was going to explain the history of what makes a city a city in the UK, but honestly, it was a bit dull! And the actual story here is how a local government tried to save a bit of money and ended up losing a status symbol that was nearly 800 years old. The only thing I need to cover first is that, after centuries of changes to the rules, the British definition of a city now, in the 21st century, is that a city is a city because ""it's on the government's list of cities"". That's it. That's the whole definition! Despite what many people think, it's got nothing to do with size, or power, or population, or cathedrals, or castles, or universities, or history. Those might be reasons that a city was put on the list centuries in the past, but these days the only rule is: is it on the government's list? And new cities get added to the list because the Queen says so. Usually when there's some big national celebration. Sometimes there'll be a competition and bidding process, and a few dozen towns and villages will file paperwork saying why they should get ""city status"". The decision's actually taken by government ministers, of course, the Queen just approves it, but officially: the Queen says ""that one!"", and that's a city now. That was a really bad impression of the Queen. So the people of Rochester were quite surprised in 2002 when they discovered that Rochester was no longer on the list. It hadn't been for four years. And they were now just living in a regular town, not a city. Not because they'd angered the Queen, although that would have been fun, but apparently because someone forgot to file some paperwork. Rochester had been a city since the 13th century, when its cathedral was consecrated. And that made sense when there was A Cathedral, and a small town around it, and then countryside. But by the 1970s, urban expansion had merged the string of towns along this bit of the Medway river. Strood, Rochester, Chatham: they were all one big conglomeration, joined up together. So in 1974 as part of national reforms, all those local governments were merged too, legally becoming the Borough of Medway. Rochester as an actual legal Place With A Local Government... ...was no more. But the Queen issued some special paperwork called Letters Patent that said, yes, okay, fine, Rochester, the part that's been a city for 800 years, that can still be a city. Which would've been fine. A few years later, the local government then petitioned to extend that city status to the whole borough, calling it Rochester-upon-Medway. Great big city. Covers the whole area. And it's not tied to the old city boundaries any more, it's tied to the local government district instead. Which probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Until 1998, when districts were due to be merged again in another local government reshuffle. The towns of Gillingham and Rainham were going to be connected in, and the whole area would legally become known as just Medway. And by that time, the rules had changed. To stay a city they didn't just need a bit of paperwork from the Queen. The local council had to appoint ""Charter Trustees"", a group to represent the original city. The cost was estimated at about Â£60,000. Exactly what happened next depends on who you ask, and when you asked it. No-one seemed to notice at all until four years after the reshuffle, when a local historical society spotted that Rochester... wasn't on the list any more. In news articles back then, it was put down to an administrative error. But a few years ago, one party's politicians dug through some paperwork, looked through some minutes of meetings, and blamed the other side for doing it as a deliberate policy. A Freedom of Information Request pulled the minutes from the archives into public view just a few weeks ago as I record this, and as far as I can tell they're inconclusive: it might be that the council didn't understand the consequences, it might have been that no-one wanted to pay for it and the buck kept being passed. Now, there's a standard rule of thumb called Hanlon's Razor: never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence. But also, those meeting minutes are written in exactly the sort of kind-of-ambiguous way that I would write if I knew I was making a risky decision and I wanted to avoid blame for it later. The truth is probably lost to history, because no-one is going to remember what was actually said in those meetings more than 20 years later. And even if they did, they probably won't want to take the blame now. And now the city status is lost. Rochester can't get it back. Because Rochester isn't really a legally defined place any more. Sure, you can type the name into a navigation app, you will get here. There are signs, you could probably draw some borders with a bit of research. But there's no legal Rochester Council who could appoint those trustees. There hasn't been for twenty years. Medway could become a city. They've tried a few times, but the Queen hasn't chosen them yet. And Medway is not Rochester. Does it make any difference? Legally, no: village, neighbourhood, town, city, none of them have any distinction in British law any more. But one of those words makes the place sound bigger and more prestigious, maybe being on the list would affect whether a place gets investment or businesses moving to the area. But it looks like Rochester will now forever be... well, arguably? Not even a town. Just a neighbourhood of Medway. A very very windy neighbourhood of Medway! There's a storm coming tomorrow, it would've been worse."
219,The giant chainmail box that stops a house dissolving,"This is the Hill House in south-west Scotland.  It was built in 1902 using design and construction techniques that were years ahead of their time. It's an important bit of architectural history, but because it was years ahead of its time, it was also experimental. It turns out that the house exterior just soaks up all the heavy Scottish rains, and lets the water in. 120 years after it was built, this whole building is slowly cracking and crumbling and dissolving. The first step of saving this house is to dry it out, slowly and carefully. The problem is, it rains 190 days a year around here. So the National Trust for Scotland had to build a very big drying room. The Hill House is so important. It is globally known. We attract visitors from all over the world in a pilgrimage to come and visit the Hill House. Charles Rennie Mackintosh is definitely one of Scotland's most famous architects and designers. It is Mackintosh's domestic masterpiece and really is so ahead of its time. When you walk through the front door, when you picture what was essentially a Victorian family living in this house, you realise how forward-thinking Mackintosh was in his design. He used a material called Portland cement on the exterior. There is no lime at all used on site as well. We're located in one of the wettest parts of Scotland in Helensburgh so it really was a recipe for disaster. The Hill House has been described as ""dissolving like an aspirin in a glass of water"". The box basically buys us some time to dry the house out, shelter it from around 86% of the elements. It acts like a giant umbrella and shields the house from the weather. The walls in this box are made of chainmail. If you go and order a modern armour costume with a chainmail vest, it will be made of this same stuff. It's more than 30 million rings of stainless steel linked together, weighing eight tonnes. The roof catches most of the rain and the chain mail catches what blows in from the sides, but it also lets air through for ventilation. It lets bees and other insects through to pollinate the plants in here. And it's all recyclable afterwards because it's steel. You just melt it down into something else. The box is made up of 32.4 million individual chain mail links that surround the house, in the worlds largest sheet of chain mail. In terms of construction, it took nine months. It really is one of a kind. It costs around Â£4,500,000. If you were to cover the house completely, it would be at risk of suffering from environmental shock and it would cause more damage than good. The box style allows the house to breathe, that is really important. It would dry out too quickly and it would cause damage to the exterior and, indeed, to the collection inside the property as well. Before, you were able to visit the house, and it was here on its own and it was amazing, but the box adds another level. There are walkways all around the property. You can walk around the perimeter of the house, even up and over the top, seeing the house from aspects that Mackintosh himself would never even have seen. What you're seeing at the Hill House is conservation in action. They didn't need to add the staircases and gantries and ramps here. But if you block this house from public view for the 15 years it'll take to dry out and repair, then there's a chance the public are going to forget about it. It'll look like a construction site, an eyesore. If instead you highlight it, you create something one-of-a-kind like this box and you let the public see the house from angles that will likely never be possible again... well, then, you're not just preserving important architecture. You're promoting it. And for me, that's the cleverest part of all this. I wouldn't be here, you wouldn't be watching this, if it wasn't for the box. It was built in 1902-[laughs] There's one more step than I thought there was there!"
220,Literally just three minutes where I talk about some rocks,"This path is steep, and slippery, and a little bit dangerous, so excuse me if I seem a bit distracted, I'm trying to concentrate on balancing the camera, balancing me, and saying words. This isn't going to be an in-depth video about geology: I'm not a geologist. But today I'm on the road, and my route has taken me past something that I've wanted to put my own two feet on for a long time. This is Siccar Point, about an hour east of Edinburgh in Scotland. And yeah, it just looks like some rocks on the coast, but: this is one of the most important geological sites in the world. And what I love about this story here is that it combines something that happened a long time ago, more than 200 years, with something that happened a Long Time Ago, hundreds of millions of years. In 1788 James Hutton, who's now known as the father of modern geology visited here in a boat. He was looking for places that would help his theory that the earth was far, far older than people thought at the time. He was looking for two types of rock right next to each other in a way that could only have been made over what we now call ""geological time"". 435 million years ago, a type of grey sandstone called greywacke was laid down at the bottom of what was then the ocean. Over millions of years it was folded tilted and uplifted, millimeter by millimeter, until the layers became almost vertical. and then 370 million years ago, red sandstone was laid down on top of it. And over the hundreds of millions of years that followed, as animals crawled out of the ocean and dinosaurs evolved and went extinct and eventually humans came along, there was more uplift, more tilting, more erosion and now, today, above sea level you have something that should have been impossible according to scholars in the 18th century: two completely different ages, types and directions of rock locked to each other, clear for the eye to see It's called an ""unconformity"". Hutton had found other unconformities before, and he'd find more afterwards. They're not too rare if you know what you're looking for, and he knew what he was looking for. But this was the most obvious, the most dramatic, the most convincing. Not that it did convince everyone. Opinions don't change that quickly, and the scientific process is slow. It took more than one person and more than one lifetime for the theory to become properly accepted. But now if you've done basic, high-school earth science: none of this is surprising, right? That's how the whole planet works. And that's why I wanted to stop by here, that's why I wanted to show this to more people. Because my big question is: is there anything like this left? Anything that can be explained in a couple of minutes to a modern person, that describes something that's now obvious to pretty much everyone, but that is still sitting undiscovered somewhere out there in the world until one person with the right knowledge is in the right place. I think it's unlikely there'sÂ  anything like that left. With eight billion people on the planetÂ  and satellite photography ofÂ  pretty much every part of it I think it's probable that we've got all the low hanging fruit. But wouldn't it be wonderful if for once, just for once, somewhere in the world, we got a new discovery like this?"
221,How one British laboratory protects the world's chocolate,"In the last few years, there have been  a lot of breathless news articles about the upcoming shortage of chocolate. Around the world, demand for chocolate is rising, particularly in China and India, and the supply isn't matching it.  It turns out that the cocoa beans that get turned into chocolate are a really difficult crop to grow. Cocoa needs fairly specific climate conditions. It needs a lot of management.  And about 30 to 40% of the entire world's crop of cocoa is just lost to pests and diseases every year. So what the modern world needs is new, hardier, more pest resistant varieties of cocoa with higher yields. Botanists send plant cuttings around the world, so they can cross breed them and see what the results are. But the trouble is: if you're sending cuttings around the world, you might be sending diseases with them, and that could be devastating. Which is why in a rural bit of southern England, there sits the International Cocoa Quarantine Center. The quarantine process lasts for two years. The reason why it is so long is because viruses can potentially stay latent in the plant for a long period of time. We generally receive plant material from what we call ""gene banks"", so these are the research centers that have collections of lots of different types of cocoa plants. That plant material arrives as what we call ""bud sticks"". We will inspect that material in the laboratory, make sure there's no signs of fungal spores or insects on it. But whilst it's quite easy to spot a pest or a fungal problem, viral diseases can be much more difficult to spot. When a researcher or grower orders  a cutting from here, they know that they won't also get something nasty that could infect their  existing cocoa crop or even their entire region's cocoa crop. But what they'll receive isn't the original plant that was sent in. This isn't like quarantine for parcels or for people. They don't take an incoming cocoa plant, put it in the bit of this warehouse that I'm not allowed to be in because it's quarantined, and then just send it on. After the two years' quarantine, the center here has a known safe plant, one of these that I'm actually allowed to stand near, and then they can send cuttings out on request, over and over and over again. There are other quarantine centers for other plants. There's a quarantine facility for bananas, for example. I believe there's one in Scotland for potatoes. A particular thing about cocoa is that a lot of the pests and diseases of cocoa are only found in particular geographical regions. If growers can be supplied with plants which are more resilient to these threats, so more resilient to pests and diseases, and more resilient  to extreme temperatures, then that helps in securing the future of the crop. There is one obvious question, of course, if all the unsafe cocoa that might have pests in it is sitting somewhere around here in rural England... what if one of those pests escapes? In the UK, we don't grow cocoa.  It's too cold, but that's actually a positive thing in terms of the location of the quarantine center. So the fact that we're located in a country that does not grow cocoa means there's no risk of pests and diseases which are endemic to cocoa entering the facility. So if we were to receive any material which had a nasty disease, that material would be discarded.  It would be autoclaved just as a precaution, but the chance of it establishing here would be almost zero. If there does end up being a worldwide cocoa shortage, it doesn't mean that the grocery store shelves will end up empty. It just means that the price of chocolate will rise and rise and rise as supply falls.  And the big manufacturers would very much like to make sure that chocolate does not go back to being a luxury. And the folks here at the quarantine center  are doing their bit to make sure that doesn't happen."
222,The meters-high mountain of mannequins in the Midlands,"It's often quicker and easier to buy something new rather than secondhand, especially if you're part of a business. New things can be bought easily online, usually from a company you've already got a relationship with, invoiced for automatically, and handled without really any thought or management required. And then once your project's finished, particularly for a short term industry like media or fashion, say, you can just throw the thing out, 'cause the job's done. Related to that... there's a metres-high mountain of mannequins in the Midlands. A lot of of them I have purchased, and have been in my collection for hire, but a lot of them have come along because they were destined for landfill. Somebody got in touch with me, a friend from a long time ago, and said, ""I see you're hiring mannequins. ""We've got some that are going to be thrown into the bin. ""Would you be interested?"" So I said, ""Well, yeah, of course, how many?"" He says, ""Oh, about 100."" And then over a period of about four months, 25,000 of them turned up from all over Europe because people had heard about this mad woman in Lincolnshire who will rehome unwanted dummies. There's a deliberate misspelling for the company name, ""manna"", food from heaven, and ""kin"", kindred spirit, because it was almost gifted to me during a time when really I had nothing. It was just perfect. Absolutely perfect name. Where we are right now, this is the spray bay. When they go out on hire, they look lovely, brand new. They come back in with chips, broken bits, dirt all over them. So they're all cleaned up, put on these rails. And then they're wheeled into the front of the spray bay, where they receive a new coat of paint. Also for Â£50 here, you can have a ""drive-through mannequin heist"", where you get 15 minutes to fit as many mannequins and mannequin parts as you can into the back of your car. I did consider doing that, but... I don't need any mannequins. Normally we would have open days where people can come and go through and collect bits and pieces. What the whole COVID situation has enabled me to do was, okay, instead of people just coming in and wandering around, and you could potentially have quite a lot of people doing that at any one time, I set up a booking system so that people can book in and pay and then they drive through and then they stop at ""mannequin mountain"". And then I would get on a loud speaker, and have a timer. And then it's a case of, ""you've got 15 minutes ""to fill up the back of your car with body parts!"" It's hilarious. So some people know what a supermarket sweep is, right? And they come in and [roaring] and they're all filling up quick. And then other times you've got people, they've parked their car one end, but they walk all the way up to the other end to collect a pair of legs and then come all the way back. And I'm thinking, you're going to run out of time. [laughs] So hands are a really interesting one because if I'm putting together some mannequins from that mountain, I need to make sure that if I've got 10 of something, that I've got 10 pairs of hands to go with that, 'cause it needs to be a set. So we did have someone who turned up once and literally filled up the back of their car with hands, and I'm like, [whimpering], [laughs] I'm sort-of having a freak out for future putting-mannequins-together. I'll be honest, even in daylight, this place feels a little creepy. There is something unsettling about being surrounded by not-quite-human figures in every direction. Fortunately, the folks here do understand that, particularly around Halloween. At Halloween, I open up the yard so that people can walk around at night in a mannequin graveyard. I did something that I called the ""Awful Halloween Walk."" It's out in the middle of nowhere. And there's literally bodies and mannequins all over the place. So it's not something that you would usually see. It is something really, really bonkers, out of this world. And so that has attracted quite a few different film crews, not just horror films, which is the obvious one, but also for music videos. So most people who are selling mannequins in the UK, they do sell them. They don't do the hire because there's a lot of work involved, but selling them is a linear process. So they are made, most of the time, in China. They get transported over, they go into the shops, they're used and then they are just put in the bin. They get crushed. They go into landfill. Now, they are made from fibreglass. It's something that doesn't decompose at all. And also they're really good fun things. So why on earth would you crush them and put them into landfill, when in actual fact there are so many different uses for them that could be done, not only to wear fashion,  but to go onto TV sets, film sets. People come and get them to decorate their gardens at Halloween. There's never a reason for ""let's put that mannequin in the bin""."
223,The Thames Barrier must never fail. Here's why it doesn't.,"If the Thames Barrier were to fail when it was needed, the damage would be almost impossible to calculate. The best estimates I've found say that the financial cost of London flooding would be somewhere between Â£20 billion and Â£100 billion. The Houses of Parliament, every skyscraper in the city of London, every building near the river would be unusable for weeks. The central parts of the London Underground would be out of action for months, possibly more. That's before you get to the human costs. Worst case, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people who'd be forced out of their homes. Which is why this barrier is designed to not fail. To be clear, that still means it can have occasional glitches or scheduled maintenance, or even have parts of it break entirely. But if any of those things happen, it must still protect London. And there's a whole team who work here full time to make sure that it does. We aim to move each of the ten individual gates at least twice a month to exercise them. Today is one of our monthly test closures. For test closures, we close just as the tide is finishing going out. And that way, we can wait until the tide turns and then we get equilibrium on both sides of the Barrier, and therefore, we can reopen. That avoids us having to be closed for the full tidal cycle. A couple of months ago, the Barrier had a full high-tide test closure and it is dramatic. Normally, the gates just sit out of the way on the bottom of the river, but when they're needed, they're rotated up into place. Well, for the annual test closure, because we're trying to maximise the differential, the water levels on each side of the barrier, we like to close early in the tidal cycle to allow that differential level to build up to a maximum of 4Â½ metres. On a flood defence closure, we close much later in the tidal cycle, because we just want to stop the danger element of the tide  going up into Central London. We try and be gentle with the river. So, we start by closing the outer smaller gates. And then, we slowly work across into the middle. And sometimes, we'll bring the two 61-metre gates in the centre of the river up a couple of metres below the surface, before we finally bring them into the closed position. And that avoids a reflective wave of the water that's coming in and being stopped, being pushed back downstream. So, during a flood defence closure, we don't have to stop the whole tide going into Central London. We just need to stop the part of that tide that would overtop the linear defences. Normal spring tides that go into London each day do not overtop the embankment walls, for example. But if you've got a surge element on top of that, that is what would go over the top of the walls in London, and that's the element that we need to stop with the Barrier. Once we've stopped the danger element of the tide and got a differential, we've effectively created a reservoir upstream of the Barrier. We can then over-rotate the large gates and allow a controlled flow of water upstream into the reservoir that we've created. And again, that reduces the amount of time before we get equilibrium on both sides of the barrier and can reopen. The barrier cannot be allowed to fail when it's needed. So, each gate can be moved by one of four separate motors. That service tunnel I was in? There are two of them, a few metres apart, identical, with completely independent power and control systems. The barrier has three connections to the UK power grid, for both the north and south of the river. And if the entire British national power grid fails, which has never happened, but if it does, the barrier has three separate diesel generators, any one of which could operate the entire thing. We have a number of modes of operation, so that if, when we're using Mode 1 operation, we have a problem of a technical nature, we go to Mode 2. Problem with Mode 2, we go to Mode 3. We don't necessarily have time to sort out any technical issues, but we've got other modes of operation that we can fall back on. The barrier has to close when we need it to. I always say that if the Prime Minister was stood in the House of Commons in his wellingtons and we said, ""Sorry, PM, we'll get it right next tide,"" that would probably be fairly career-limiting(!) So, that's the technical resilience. What about the physical construction? Well, these piers are made of Portland cement, so, they'll stand for a couple of centuries at least. The steel gates are protected by what's called a sacrificial anode. Corrosion in water like this is an electrochemical process. So, if you connect a chunk of metal that's more easily corroded to something like the gate, that chunk of metal will take the corrosion damage instead, and you can replace it fairly easily whenever you need to. So, the gates will also be fine for a century or so. What if a ship hits the Barrier? Well, ships are designed to float. Relatively speaking, they're not that solid. These piers are thick concrete, and each of the main gates is 3,000 tonnes of steel. So, the ship's going to come off worse. Collisions have actually happened several times. In 1997, a ship called the Sand Kite hit one of the piers. The only damage to the Barrier was some scratched paint and a broken ladder, but the ship sank. The trouble was that it sank where it hit and sat broken on top of one of the open gates. That would've blocked that part of the Barrier from closing. The contingency plan, if there had been a flood tide, would have been to close all the other gates and use the force of the water trying to get through to blast the wrecked ship clear. But also, even if one gate was completely broken somehow, the Barrier would still not technically fail. The margin for error would be gone, but that's why the margin's there. It would still hold back enough water to keep London safe. We have a series of forecast models and we run what we call an ensemble forecast that looks many tides ahead. With any models, particularly forecast models, you will always get a degree of error. So, the forecaster here will make an adjustment to the forecast and that data will be passed to the controller from which to make a decision as to whether to close or not. So, the barrier is highly reliable and strong. What if there's a really high tide, a storm surge that's too much for this to cope with? Well, the design odds of that are one in a thousand per year. Not technically failure, just not being specified high enough. The barrier was designed in 1970 for a 60-year life, which would be 2030, which must've seemed a very long way away then. The good news is that with modern simulations and modelling, the team here are confident that it'll last another 40 years at least. But part of the reason for that is because those 1970s engineers built in a huge margin of safety. They didn't cut corners then, and that's given us breathing space now. The gates themselves, with inspections and remedial works, will probably be good to go until 2070, but a lot of the supporting infrastructure, the fire systems, the security systems, even the cranes on the piers will all have to be updated in the years to come. But what if the tide went high enough to actually overtop the barrier? Well, those gates are built strong enough that any water they can't hold back can flow under into the low water on the other side. Remember, they close the barrier early, when the river's at its lowest point, so, yes, if some apocalyptic storm comes along, the barrier should still work well enough. If this was almost anything else, you could say the redundancy was over-specified, that requirements like this were ridiculous, but with so much at stake, the Thames Barrier is a marvel not just of engineering, but of how you have to build when something cannot be allowed to fail."
224,The town where holding fireworks over your head is a tradition,"Across Britain, a lot of towns and villages have all sorts of strange, old traditions for Bonfire Night, on November the 5th. Most of those traditions involve fire, pyrotechnics, and a significant chance of personal injury to anyone taking part. And I've never shown any of those traditions on this channel before, for a few reasons. First, most of them have already been well-documented. Second, a lot of the towns actually prefer to keep their traditions quiet, because they already deal with too many tourists. Like a lot of things, mass media and easy travel have started to ruin what might be centuries-old practices in the towns. And third... Well, I've never actually been invited to take part before. This is Bridgwater, in southwest England, and today, I'll be holding a terrifying amount of pyrotechnics directly above my head, in a big parade with a couple of hundred other people. This isn't going to be a normal video, because honestly, I'm not really sure what happens next. I have no script beyond this point. They just said, ""Do you want to be in the squibbing display?"" And... I said yes. This is a Bridgwater squib. It's a Category 4 firework, so it should only be used in displays. People obviously have had the Health and Safety training, like everybody that does it in the street tonight. It's not available to the general public, and this specific one is made only for Bridgwater Carnival. In here is about a pound of gunpowder. (laughs) Okay. And various metallic elements. So you got iron, titanium... All stuff that's gonna spark. Phosphorus, lots of phosphorus metal, so exactly right. So you get the heat burning from the gunpowder initially, which heats up the metal, and that flies, comes out, and then gives you the golds, the silvers, as the heated elements come out the top. So I'm gonna be holding a large chunk of flaming gunpowder and metal dust above my head. Yeah, two feet above your head. Okay! Along with 250 other people. Alright! This is the cosh. This is the cosh, right. As you can see, it's a glorified broom handle, in a way. It's obviously changed over the years. You can see various different-shaped ones through the back there. But this one is quite old. This one is probably... 60-70 years old, that one. Blimey, really? Yeah. My dad had it from the club. He was well off with them. A lot of these get handed on from generation to generation. Wow, okay. So... 60-year-old cosh, and it's having... I mean, some explosives tied to it. Let's do it. So, if you will hold it... Yeah. Like that. They were roped on for generations. But rope... tends to stretch. Years ago, they used to have a banging, which was a fire at the end. Which, we can't have an aerial anymore. We're not allowed to fire things up into the air. Okay. I mean, we are on a High Street. It doesn't seem unreasonable(!) It's like, any of these traditional, regional things that it wouldn't be allowed if you were to ask anywhere else in the world to do it now. In England in particular, they would not allow it. How do you keep it safe then? 'Cause obviously, there's a lot of gunpowder, and there's gonna be crowds around in the street. Firstly, you'll be fully kitted out in PPE. So you'll have always full protection on. When we leave here and we line you up, you'll be carrying this out with your gloved hand over the fuse. So it's held like that over your shoulder. This is a bag of lighting wads. It's soaked in fluid. Lighter fluid. Blue roll in lighter fluid. Yeah, okay. We place those down the middle of the street. Yep. And once I'm happy that they're all in place, I sound a horn. The lighters from each club will light these wads. So you'll see a seam of fire going down through the centre of the road. Then you just pull off the safety cover. Yep. And again, once those wads are lit, down through the road, and you hear the second horn... The second horn, okay. First horn, safety cover off. Yeah, all you do is dip your fuse straight into the lighting fluid. It'll fire straight away. Yep. And then vertical, up above your head at arm's length. Right. It sounds very simple, but it will seem a lotâ It doesn't sound that simple! That's a lot of gunpowder very near my head! That is very true, but you'll be fine. You'll enjoy it, honestly, but it will seem longer than a minute(!) Squibbing today is historic. It's been part of the tradition of Bridgwater, going back to the 1600s. Almost 430 years-ish now, there's been a squibbing of one form or another. It's all to do with the 1605 Gunpowder Plot and the failure of Guy Fawkes. People had a bonfire, they threw the effigy on it, and they used to have fireworks around the pubs. And that's how it started. We're on the move. Back then, they'd make their own fireworks at home, which was lots of wads of paper, and of course, they're very volatile. A lot of them exploded. People were killed over the years. And then, groups in the pubs then started to have a theme, they'd dress up. So Carnival was born from that, but the squibbing was the start of it. And then coming right up to modern day, post-Second World War onwards, we've had organized displays. Obviously, the finale after the Carnival procession is the squibbing event. Light the wads! We have got the opportunity to set a record. The 400th anniversary in 2005 of the failed Gunpowder Plot, we had 180. So I said, ""Let's try and get 200."" And the clubs have been great, for we got 250. Okay, now I'm nervous. ...from ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Light those squibs! Stand well back, ladies and gentlemen. Make sure you're safe. Absolutely fantastic! And you can see these coloured squibs. You can see these coloured squibs in the middle. Squibbing is unique to Bridgwater. It's unique to Bridgwater Carnival. It's the biggest illuminated carnival in Europe, and probably second or third in the whole world. So it is something special, and squibbing is a big part of that. Thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen! We sincerely hope that next year, we'll have a proper Carnival back on the streets of Bridgwater. [Caption+ by JS* https://caption.plus]  Have a good journey home, and we'll see you back here next year on the streets of Bridgwater, on Saturday, the 5th of November! Woo-hoo!"
225,The tunnel where people pay to inhale radioactive gas,"I know it's infuriating when anyone presents both sides of an issue and says: ""let the audience decide"". And I don't really like doing meta stuff where I talk about the process of making videos, but I can't find any other way to give enough context to make this video work. Hence the ""come for a walk with me through a rough bit of the English countryside"" GoPro camera shot. It's important to break the format visually as well. I've been sharing videos from around Germany, Austria and Switzerland over the past couple of weeks. One of the first things I filmed on that trip was the radon tunnel, the ""radonstollen"", in Bad Kreuznach in south-west Germany. The video should have gone out weeks ago. But despite filming going really well on location, despite being really happy with my script and the interview at the time, I just wasn't comfortable with it when I got back here to the UK. Radon, or ""rad-don"" if you're German, is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that's produced naturally by uranium decay. All around the world, tiny tiny amounts of it seep out from wide areas of the ground and get diluted into the atmosphere harmlessly. But if your house is in a particularly bad radon area, like here in Oxfordshire, then you can get detectors installed or tests done to check that radon isn't building up inside your house and exposing you to too much radiation. Which is why I was surprised that there are a few places in the world where people go to be exposed to radon deliberately for pain relief. So: the radon tunnel in Bad Kreuznach. It is a tunnel that was founded 1775. People tried to find mercury here. They dug for mercury. They did never find mercury, but round about 110 years ago, they found radon. The dose is, per one hour treatment, between 30-60 thousand bequerels. On average you need ten treatments, one hour. At the end, the application will have a dose of around about 2.2 millisieverts. To give you an idea what is the equivalent: if you have, for instance, X-rays of your hip or your knee, it is more or less the same, equivalent. A complete CT of the complete body has about between 20 and 40 millisieverts. Every medically trained person that I've talked to about radon therapy, they've all gone through the same three stages that I did. First of all, complete skepticism, ""oh, that sounds like a bad idea"". Certainly, most of the world would consider deliberate exposure to radioactive gas for pain relief as alternative medicine. That's what I did. And then stage two. You look at the scientific papers and, yes, the marketing, that talk about what limited trials there have been, and the patient testimonials, and the theories about why it works, and the reaction becomes... agh, I guess maybe it's worth a look? But there's a conflict of interest declaration in that paper. But it says the funders had no say in the results or the release. And there is almost a folk belief in some parts of the nuclear industry, particularly in the US, about something called ""radiation hormesis"", where very small doses of radiation can have a beneficial effect, they think, because they cause repair systems in your body to kick into action. But that is an idea, a hypothesis. It's not even really a theory yet. It's not been properly tested. All the major international authorities say that it's entirely unproven and there isn't really any truly safe dose of radiation. And yet, radon therapy seems to work for a lot of people. So then you've reached the third stage: not knowing how to even talk about this responsibly. That's where I'm at. I've met the people who run a radon tunnel. I've talked to a patient. I've got a duty of care to them, as I do to anyone I film with. But I also have a duty to the audience and to the truth: scientific or historical or personal. So I need to make something very clear. This is not an endorsement. I think radon therapy is fascinating. The people who run the radon spa definitely think it works. Certainly, most of their patients do. There's just enough evidence here that this unqualified skeptic can't write it off, not immediately. And the fact that there's all this infrastructure for handling radioactive gas as part of something that most of the world hasn't even heard of? Well, I think that's interesting enough to at least discuss. Just to make clear: it is not ""wellness"", it's not miracles. We do not promise something weird. It is pure medicine. It's a medical application where you need a doctor's prescription. And at the end, 85% of the patients, they report it helped, it worked. So you get rid of your medication for pain relievers for one year and more. It is not wellness. That's really...  it must be clear. Obviously, to get a license for this, especially in Germany, it's a really huge and complicated process, and therefore we have to prove that the minimum application of the doses is not below 30,000Bq and the maximum dose is never above 100,000Bq. We are always, in the average, somewhere between 30-60 thousand, which is a perfect range for the treatment. There are plenty of doctors and health insurance companies in Germany that endorse radon therapy, but that isn't evidence for it working. The British National Health Service paid for some homeopathic treatments until 2017, despite a mountain of evidence proving that homeopathy does absolutely nothing. Homeopathy may feel like it works for some people, but if you just give people a sugar pill, a placebo, and say ""it'll help with your pain"", a lot of the time feels like it does help, at least for the short term. The placebo effect isn't quite as magical as some folks think, but certainly very powerful for sensations like pain and nausea... the sort of things that radon therapy is intended to treat. But the trouble is that radon spas aren't like homeopathy or like magnet therapy. They're not popular enough to have been comprehensively tested. Anecdotes are not evidence for something medical, particularly when radiation is involved. The warning signs  of quackery, of fake medicine, are: bold claims about miracle cures; single interventions that claim to help wildly different conditions; or explanations that defy the laws of physics. It's not guaranteed to be quackery if you've got those, of course, but those are the warning signs. In other parts of the world, radon therapy is much less regulated. In Montana, USA, say, there are old radon-filled mines that just charge admission to go sit inside. And some of them make wild claims about helping diabetes, gout, asthma, MS or even cancer. But the claims made in Germany are much more limited and specific. It's just for relief of chronic pain, and the cause of chronic pain can often be a mystery. And so can how to treat it. The treatment doesn't work instantly, so if you leave the tunnel, you are not instantly cured. Patients, they report to us, normally it takes some days, up to 6-8 weeks, when it works. We are aware that some other tunnels worldwide, they claim they can cure anything. We are pain relief, pain relief from inflammatory process. Not more and not less. Normally, people think ""radioactivity, oh, that's harmful!"" but it is always the same question: it's the doses that makes sense, and what we here apply. You see this equipment that is monitoring how much radon is emitted, and we do emit radon in that quantity that is necessary to initiate healing processes. There's one line in that big analysis paper that says it's really difficult to do a fully double-blind study about this. That would be where each patient doesn't know if they're receiving radon or not, and neither do the staff or the doctors. Yes, radon is colorless and odorless, but it's always there, coming out the ground. You can't fool people into walking into a somehow-identical tunnel or cabin that you've just mysteriously constructed next door to the old one, but that doesn't happen to have radon in it this time. Except: in that one tunnel in Bad Kreuznach, you can turn off the radon. This is absolutely unique, and to my knowledge, no other tunnel worldwide has the same technique. And that is why we are, today, absolutely safe. As you see on the monitor, we have no radioactivity here besides the normal activity you have outside. The radon gas is emitted very deep down in that mountain and it is naturally emitted. At the end, we just grab the gas with with a pipeline and a kind of fan that transports it into this room. And we can switch it on and off in the proportion we need it. That's why I was allowed to film in the treatment room. It didn't have any radon in it. Not then, anyway. It hadn't been used for hours. All the ventilation meant there was just fresh air in there. It would absolutely be possible to set up a proper, large-scale, double-blind study in that tunnel. If some university or government wanted to fund it. If they could find enough willing patients. If their ethics review board would be willing to sign off on treating people with radioactive gas. And if it could be arranged that no-one, not even the staff at the tunnel, knew whether each patient was getting radon therapy or just fresh air. It would be difficult. But it's more possible there than anywhere else, and I want that trial to happen. That's why I decided to talk about this and put the video out. That's why I'm willing to risk giving an audience to something that isn't proven yet, because if that works as claimed, even just for some people with chronic pain, it'd be brilliant. Very minor radiation exposure is a risk that a lot of people would be willing to take, clearly are willing to take, if they can't get pain relief any other way. And if it doesn't work, then we  probably need to stop exposing people to radiation? I know it's a cop-out to say ""more studies are required"". It's the weak ending to every inconclusive undergraduate paper, but in this case, it's true. More studies are required, and hopefully those studies will happen soon. Because I would love to go back to a radon spa in a few years' time and follow up with the proof."
226,This tiny railroad across the sea has an important job,"Over the years I've been making videos, lots of people have suggested that I should see the Hallig islands in Germany. Mostly because of the tiny trains.  Every few years,  some media outlet does a story about how the people who live out on the islands have their own personal trains to get them to and from the mainland. And yes, I'm going to talk about those,  but the story here is way more interesting than that. Although yes, the best way to get to some of the Hallig islands from the mainland is on board tiny trains.  And the railway staff  here are going to let me take a ride. IN GERMAN: But there's a bigger question: why is there a tiny railroad here? Who builds a railroad instead of just... a road? If you're building  sea defenses in the 1930s and you need to get a load of heavy material across a tidal flat, well, rail is your most efficient option. And to understand why they need those defenses, we need to take a look at the bigger picture. But unfortunately  I'm not allowed to fly a drone here  because this is a wildlife reserve. If you look at aerial images, you can see that the whole of this area, the North German coast, is protected by these barrier islands. This area is the Wadden Sea, hundreds of kilometers of sandbars and mudflats that act as a natural wave break and storm defense.  That's what they were boosting with the earthworks here. Manage these islands correctly, you'll protect all the cities on the mainland from flooding.  Plus, people have lived on these islands for centuries now. They'll happily take the storm defense for themselves. And the free railroad that comes with it. One of the problems with living on what's basically a bit of sea defense is that you're going to be the one that gets flooded. These islands go mostly underwater 50 or 60 times a year, usually in winter. The local term for it translates as ""land under"". The houses are up on mounds to protect them, and they're built high enough for now. But one of the reasons that the railway is still in regular use is that it's still helping to build the sea defenses. It seems strange to describe an island as something that needs to be kept healthy, but yeah, that's why the railway's here. Yes, the locals have their own trains.  Very rarely, if they're staying on the island, tourists can ride too. And it looks quirky and interesting.  But the reason behind it is to stop these islands, and eventually the mainland, being flooded by rising seas."
227,Why this falling rocks sign is more important than most,"This is one of those problems that seems like  it'd be really complicated to fix, but turns out to have a simple solution. But then that solution turns out to be really complicated. This is Brienz in Switzerland.  It's a small alpine village surrounded by  absolutely beautiful hills and mountains that occasionally try to kill people. This whole hillside is slowly sliding and slipping down. It can't hold itself up. Most of the time, it's silent and still. But occasionally, a load of heavy rocks will tumble down. Actually, I feel like ""heavy rocks"" isn't really getting the point across. This is one of the rocks.  And worst case, it'll travel across that road at 10 or 20 kilometres an hour, sideways. IN SWISS GERMAN: The village is safe from the big individual rockfalls, it's far enough away.  The road here, not so much. It'd be far too expensive  to build massive protection barriers all along there. And besides, the odds of a boulder actually hitting a car are small. But not zero. So what you want  is something that can automatically detect rockfalls and close the road. Simple solution: a radar... and a stoplight.  So if the radar detects rockfall in a certain defined area, it triggers an alarm. The traffic lights go red, and then the radar tracks the rockfall. If the rockfall stops or it ends up in the dam, then the traffic light switches off, goes back to normal, the road is safe to pass., If the rockfall ends up somewhere close to the road, the traffic light switches to flashing orange, which means ""drive carefully"", because a boulder could be on the road, or the road could be damaged. Radar has the large benefit that it works in all weather and all visibility conditions. Radar waves can penetrate fog, rainfall, snowfall; and hence, works day at night and in all visibility conditions, which is needed for an alarm system. The traffic lights are about 450 meters apart, which is the area considered as dangerous for the traffic. We've got about 40 seconds from detachment to a rock reaching the road, and this is just enough for the cars to escape the dangerous area. They have to drive a certain velocity, otherwise they can't get away. And this is why cyclists are not allowed on this road. Here's the complicated bit: you can't just have this stop traffic any time the radar detects movement. Birds would set it off. My drone would set it off.  Mischievous kids throwing pebbles would set it off. On that note... How do you calibrate something like this? We don't have a lot of false alarms.  It's very rare that we close the road because of something else, for example, an approaching rain front that could look kind of similar. Since this is such an active site, this is the perfect site to tune your algorithms or to develop the algorithms at all. We installed the radar in 2017, and after a test period of about a year, it went live with the traffic lights. And since installation, we've detected five and a half thousand events. From an engineering perspective,  setting up a radar and a stoplight is the easy part. The complicated part is working out  the balance between false positives, where the road is going to be closed half the time, and false negatives, where cars could get hit by boulders. Now I haven't seen any rockfalls here today, and I also haven't seen the lights change.  And their logs now have thousands of rockfalls where the lights did turn red. So I'd say: they probably got it about right. I mean, I know it was too much to hope for, I was just hoping  there'd be just a little rock fall as I finished? Just... just like a little one. Not doing any damage. Just a few. Let's do that again! Let's do that again without worrying  that a rock's going to hit me."
228,The shooting range where you fire over a busy road,"I don't want to get into the politics of gun ownership. I'm British, I'm not exactly qualified, but I will say that Switzerland has a very high rate of people who own guns, and a pretty low rate of people who are hurt by guns.  This is the BrÃ¼nnlisau shooting range, about two hours from ZÃ¼rich. And I think it's the best possible demonstration of the attitude that Switzerland has to both firearms and firearms safety. You fire your rifle from there.  The targets are over there.  And in between them is a major highway. And it's safe. IN SWISS GERMAN: Rifle shooting is a national sport in Switzerland. Service in the military is compulsory for men, albeit these days with the choice to take on civilian public service work instead. For those who do choose military service, a lot of them decide to keep their firearm when they finish, which means that yes, there are a lot of people with guns in Switzerland, but they pretty much all have thorough training in how to use them. All right. So I lie down...  Yes, yes. All the way down. OK. OK. Your target is number seven.  Number seven... I thought  this was a magnifier. It's not a magnifier.  You just have to be very accurate.  Without munition. Without. Yes. You look at the target and push. [hammer clicks] I think I'd have missed there. But... Yeah? OK. All right. Let's try it for real. If you're shooting a rifle here, you're lying down and you cannot see the road. Anything you fire that's traveling fast enough  to go over that wall just can't hit the road. That just isn't a possible trajectory for a bullet that can damage anything other than the hill and, of course, the targets. That goes up against my shoulder, here. In the position, yes. And gets held with this hand here. Mmhm. And I just have to line up... Look to the target and... push. Missed. Gah, I swore the recoil was going to hit me in the eye there. Closer! High and right. Okay! five. I'm going the other way now.  Hey! Hey, that's a ten! This is a ten, yes! Got there in the end.  Nine. It's good. I'll take that. That's, what, 56 out of 100, and I got one in the bullseye. Yes. I'll take that.  Thank you very much.  Danke schÃ¶n. You're welcome. Now, there is the reasonable question: well, what if someone were to stand up? Then they could see and hit the road.  Well, again: training, it's unlikely to happen. And also, breaking the safety rules when you're surrounded by military-trained firearm enthusiasts is...  not a great plan? ""What if you stand up"" is basically the same question as ""what if you decide to point the rifle at someone""?  You will very rapidly not be holding a rifle anymore. If someone wants to cause harm with a gun,  this is not the way they'd do it. Joining a rifle club, getting all the permits and then deciding to throw all that away to take a potshot at a car just once? I'm not sure there's anyone who's sensible enough to do the first bits of that, and unhinged enough to do the last part. And if there is, they've never made it here."
229,The world's only float-through McDonalds,"Giant multinational corporations don't generally have the best of reputations. And I want to stress that this is not an advert for McDonald's. I approached them about filming this. Because almost everyone who watches this video will have eaten at McDonald's at some point in their lives. I'm sure the few of you who've always turned down the opportunity will be very vocal about it in the comments(!) But for the majority of people who have eaten at the Golden Arches, well, the experience will be roughly the same wherever you are. That's the point of fast food chains. Everything's standardised. You get the same experience, the same food, no matter where you are, right? Well, when I heard that the world's only ""float-through McDonald's"" was on little canal on the Elbe River in Germany, I thought that was probably worth a visit. Now, just to manage your expectations, this is not a McDonald's with a moat around it where there's a queue of kayaks lining up for each window in turn. That would be better. But while there was an actual microphone and speaker here once, a few years ago, these days the 21st century has arrived. You have to order on the smartphone app. We've had the McBoat since 2015. In the winter, we may close, yes. But in summer and in spring, we have 24/7. People are so happy to see this because they read this or saw this on Instagram and they come especially for this. We can see your order on the screen and we make your food ready. And one person goes on, and brings the bag out and wish them a good, ""Enjoy your meal"" and a happy ""good day"". One of the things I've learned over the years I've been making videos is that people like a combination of familiarity and novelty. If everything changes, people don't like it and they move to other things. But if nothing changes, people get bored and they move to other things. And in the same way, I think it's fascinating to find something that's very close to what you already know but that changes it in one or two interesting ways. When something like McDonald's has a reputation for being controlled and standardised and you know exactly what to expect, well, seeing small reinventions of that formula can be fascinating. Plus, it gives them some publicity. Oh, and one more thing. I didn't mention exactly where in Germany we are. Because it is quite apt that the world's only float-through McDonald's... ...is in Hamburg."
230,I thought the Schmid Peoplemover was impossible,"Years ago, I made two videos on strange elevators that go both horizontally and vertically. The first was in Genoa, Italy.  It's a little cabin that travels along a tunnel  which then gets loaded  into a regular vertical elevator. The second is in a test tower in Rottweil in Germany. It uses fancy, complicated locking mechanisms and linear induction motors. But the key thing about both those designs is: they come to a complete stop when changing direction.  Because of how elevators work, safely and smoothly transitioning from horizontal to vertical just isn't possible. Or at least I thought so.  But it turns out that the Schmid Peoplemover has been doing exactly that for about 20 years. Only three of these have ever actually been installed.  Only two of them still exist.  This is the larger one, at a train station in Altbach, Germany. It took me a long time to understand how this works, and how it works safely. I had to hire an engineering consultant to look at the original patents and break it down for me. And also, with the help of a producer in Germany... I tracked down the inventor. [IN GERMAN:]       This cabin isn't being pulled by cables, the motor is in the cabin itself, it pulls itself along by turning a pair of cogs up top that sit on rack rails, one on each side of the cabin. So this is basically a cog railway. A very fancy one with anti-shake devices, but a suspended cog railway. And that explains the smooth transition to vertical at the top: the cogs just follow the rails as they curve.  But how does it do this safely,  and then travel vertically without, you know, falling to the ground? Well, like the elevator in Genoa, it does get a bit of help on the vertical part. It locks onto a carrier device and a counterweight, with safety systems that are roughly equivalent to a regular elevator.  The carrier is what you can see start moving through the window as you transition to vertical movement.  And meanwhile, down on the bottom, the counterweight sits on calibrated springs, so that as this cabin started to transfer to vertical, the counterweight gently lifted away from the springs... and everything balanced.  There is an elegant but also quite complicated docking and undocking mechanism up there in the roof of the cabin and the carrier. The closest analogy I can come up with is that it's a bit like closing an up-and-over garage door. Everything just sort of slides into place. It's a wonderful design, but it's also complicated. And the alternative is to put in an underpass, or two mass-produced elevators and a footbridge between them. Because if one of those elevators breaks down, well, it can be fixed by any qualified technician using off-the-shelf parts instead of someone who has to be specially trained for this one rare bit of equipment. And if you have a footbridge, you probably also have stairs. So if one of those elevators breaks down, there's a backup. It doesn't work for everyone, but it's better than nothing. And that also means that if you are late for your train and physically able, you can just run up, across, and down the footbridge instead of waiting for the Peoplemover to arrive.  Now, that said, there are advantages to this system. It requires much less land than a regular footbridge does. It doesn't need tunneling like an underpass.  And if you have heavy or bulky bags, well, you don't have to haul them in and out of multiple elevators and across the footbridge, it just takes them across for you. I think there is a possible world in which this design became popular, and the parts became off-the-shelf, and this became the standard. I don't think it's a bad invention.  It's very clever.  It solves a specific problem. But when there are more common and more reliable alternatives that are just a bit more hassle to install... well, not many places wanted to take the risk."
231,The world's most useful model railway,"If you want to learn to drive a train, there are simulators. A screen, a set of controls, it's pretty realistic. But that's not the only safety-critical job on the railway that needs training. The signalers who decide where trains go are just as important, making sure that every train goes down the right track and dealing with disruption when it happens so that passengers can still get where they're going. You could simulate that in a computer, sure, but there is a more physical approach. Here in Darmstadt, Germany, there is the world's most useful model railway. In this place, we started in 2006 at the Technical University in Darmstadt. We had a similar facility since 1936. We have about 500 square metres of space available for the trainings, and a track laid out. It's a fictional layout, 1.2 kilometres. We have some fictional names. Some of the stations are named after persons that helped developing this facility. We are training actual signalmen here. They are taking exams here. So these are the oldest systems on the Deutsche Bahn network? Okay, yeah, it's right. It's mechanical interlocking. Everything is worked manually. The blue levers are for the points, the red levers are for signals. And that's our train? Yeah, that's our train. And it's going that way. This way, right track. Not into that tiny train. That's right. Okay. So I have to know which points have to be turned. It's point number one and two. So if you want to try it. So, yep. You have to take it and turn it around. All the way down. Just to lower position, yep. And, oh! It's turning over there. Okay. So we have also point number 7, 8, 9, and 10. Okay, so every time I do this... One point will turn. Just a simulation. Yes. But it's an accurate one. But it works like a real signal box. 'Cause in the real world, I would be pulling that and that will be pulling through pulleys and levers and actually physically switching the point. Yeah. All right. So here we just have a computer who is turning the model points. Right, so you lock that into place, it detects that I've done that, and the computer goes ""pht"". Yeah, that's it. Okay. So we've set the points, the next is safety interlock. And that's a German thing? This is a German thing. Well, it's just common in German. We have what we call a route locking. So we want to open a special signal, so we have to take the right route lever, which is called P2. Because it says 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, which is what I've just moved. Yep, that's it. So do I pull up, down? Down, down please. So this lever checks if all the points are set correct, and second thing, he will lock all the points. So we can't move them back. What happens if I were to pull the wrong lever? Just try it. Right, okay. Try it, it won't work. Oh! It's closed. It's a physical lock. Yep. I kind of assumed that was just going to beep at me or complain, but that's an actual physical interlock. This is real, physical. Right, so now I can't evenYeah, try it. It's not possible to pull them back. You can't even close the lever. Yep. Wow, okay. So that'sSo this is an old computer. It checks if everything is set at the right position. Wow, okay. So we have put the points in position, interlocked everything to make sure it's safe. That's right. And then we justLast step is put the signal to an off position. It's P2. Which is going to be... The P2. P2, all right. Just like point levers to an off position. [machine beeping] And now the train driver sees a green signal, and he can move on. But it takes a few seconds and the computer kind of simulates... It's a simulation, because he has to release his brakes before he can start. So what's the last thing we need to do? So now we have to lock the line so another train can't follow. So we have to tell us and the next signal box there's a train on the line. So we have to put down the button and to produce some electricity. Oh! Just put it down. Pull it down. And 10 times, please. [box whirring] So that would have sent a bell ringing or something in another signal box saying we've got a train coming. Yep, that's it. So that's the manual ones. What came next? Interlocking, which is called electromechanical. That's the next thing, which was about 50 years later. All right, let's do that. We've got the next station, which is an all-electric interlocking from the 1950s. Our train is coming, we see the red arrow. It's a train intersection marker. Train will stop at the entry signal of the station. Because that's a red and green light, and there's a red light there. And this is the station. These are all the tracks, okay. So we can see all the tracks. You can see in the direction of the points. And now we want this train to enter into track number two. So, now if you want to operate a point, we have to do a two button operation, which means you have to push the button of the... Yep. And second one is this blue one. Now it starts to blink. The point is turning. And now it's on the left. And now it's on the left. So the train is now going the right way. So if there's nothing else in this section, you can then turn that to green? Yep. So, we have to make an entry-exit operation. We are starting at the entry signal and we want to move into track number two. There are two buttons. Right. Try it. So I have to push that one? Yep, and same time track number two. These two. Yep, and nothing happens. Okay! Because we are missing two another points. We have a flank protection, which is missing. There might be a train waiting here and he might just start to roll into our train. And he'll, right. So I need to change that one as well. So now there's no way that a train coming the other wayThat's right. Can come in, okay. And second point, we have to operate as point number one, which is called the overlap. So if a train won't stop at an exit signal... Yep, it'll derail there at the moment, won't it? Yes, and maybe he could hit another train, so we have to reserve this space also for the train. Okay. So that one? Yep. Which is called the overlap. All right. So, now try it again. Entry exit operation. Entry exit. Lights up? Green light. Lights up green light. Train will enter in the next, I don't know, one, two minutes. And somewhere out there on the big model, a train has started moving. That's lovely. And this is all electrical circuits. This isn't microcontrollers, this is all physical wiring. Or relay interlocking. There is really something in having that view of what you're doing versus a screen and a vague idea in a diagram. Like, I can see the train pulling into the station. That's lovely. So that's the 1950s, and there's still some of this equipment out there. Of course. Of course. What's the most modern version? That's the computer interlocking. And now I will show you. Lead the way. All of the interlockings that you used today are still in use in the German rail network. The numbers, for example, of the mechanical interlockings are dwindling at the moment. In the future, all of them will be replaced by electronic or computer interlockings. The physical railway that you crash will always stay in your mind, even if it's a model train! And you have the ability to get an overview about the situation during any sort of disruptions, not only the really focused view that you would have during this disruption. So this is the future? Yep, that's the future. So which train are we moving? We are try moving a train which is called 201. 201, okay. Yeah, I see it. So all you have to do is an entry exit operation, with a mouse. Oh, so just the single button push from earlier? Everything else is automatic? Everything else is going automatically. So first thing is you have to move the mouse pointer to the red triangle on the right side, please. It's the exit signal for the station. And now move on to just one mouse click. And now next train, please, on the right. The blueThe blue one to the right. That's the exit. And click that? Click there. I don't know why I'm being so nervous. It's a model train set. But in my head, this is serious. So it's just done all the button pushes that I did earlier. All the lever pulls. Yep. Two mouse clicks. At the moment, nothing has operated. It's just, ""I want to go,"" from track number five onto the line. And it's doing all the interlocking? Yeah. Making sure that nothing's in the way. And now have to tell the computer, ""Okay, I want to do it."" There's a button which is called in German ""Verarbeiten"" which means OK. And after you push it, all the points are moving. All at the same time. Yep. And the signal is going to... And the signal's gone to green. Yep. That's it. It absolutely makes sense, but also it seems so much easier. I know it's not. You've got exactly the same checks here. Of course. That were being done by the systems, that were being done by the circuits and then being done by the physical interlocks. But here it's code and we can see the train progress. Like, the lights go red when there's a train in the section. That's so clever. Big difference is I do have to operate 2, 3, 4, 5 stations. [Tom laughs] So it's not as simple as it looks like. Right. You know the computer game? You have to do the same amount of work, just over a much bigger area. That's it. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you."
232,The public toll road with no speed limit,"If you've already heard of the NÃ¼rburgring, then by all means, enjoy this video. We've got an interview behind the scenes, some footage of the place, but also we have me trying to explain the basics of it while being driven round the Nordschleife, the North Loop by a professional driver. Thank you, Andy. But if you haven't heard of the NÃ¼rburgring, then it may surprise you that one of the greatest, most demanding racetracks in the world is also just a public toll road. And if you want, you can just turn up and drive it. All right, I'm going to regret this. Let's do it. All right. Let's do it. There were always these three big components. So one, that the Nordschleife is open for the public. Then there's car testing. The big manufacturers are still testing many, many weeks every year here on the Nordschleife, the new components, the new cars. And of course, there's also racing. Normal traffic rules apply here. You have to drive on the right, you have to overtake on the left. But on most of the track, there is no speed limit. And that's because Germany has no national speed limit. There are thousands of kilometres of autobahn out there where you can drive as fast as you safely can. As long as you're in control of your vehicle, speed doesn't matter. So legally, this is just a one way toll road. You go to the barrier, you pay your â¬25, you go through this bit with the cones and the speed limit, and then you are on the Ring. Oh, yes! [Tom laughs] 20.8 kilometres. The NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife is the longest permanent racetrack in the world. It's in the most popular and most famous racetracks in the world, comparable to Indianapolis, to Monaco, to Daytona. But there are lots of safety rules, and the team here---oh my God---the team here asked me to make it clear that racing on the Ring on days like this is not allowed. And you'll see the cars ahead, when we're on the straights, they indicate right, they get out of the way, because legally on the autobahn, that's what you have to do. Lap timers and dashcams are forbidden. I mean, we've got special permission for these cameras...  ...my... [strained noise] We've got special permission, but none of these cars should have dashcams or timers because it is just too dangerous... ...it is too dangerous to have a clock ticking either on your dashboard or in your head. The track is unforgiving. If you come off here, you're not rolling onto grass. You're not rolling onto gravel. You are hitting a barrier, or worse, you're hittingOh, that was a drop! You're hitting someone else. The track-oh!-It has jumps. It has sections where you will-oh my God-get what roller coaster fans would call air time. Not quite ejector time, but air time. Everyone is able to drive. Of course, everyone who is sticking to the rules of our driving standards. And of course, which cars finally fit to us, that's 2.8 tonnes, is the max. People driving here round with their Porsche, but you've also got a family driving in their van here round. There is a story that if you crash, then the NÃ¼rburgring team will present you with a bill for damage. For every half-hour the safety car had to be out here, for every half-hour that they had to repair the track, for every metre of crash barrier that you have damaged. That story is absolutely, 100%... true. If you are conscious, you will be delivered a bill, but it turns out that's also true in most of the world. If you crash on a British road, then the local highways authority will send out a bill. It's just that it'll go to your insurance company, not to you. Oh, g-forces! But insurance, other than very, very good German insurance, it won't cover you for the Ring. Nearly every insurance company, particularly those outside Germany has a clause in there that specifically excludes driving here, even if you are just a tourist. In case of a heavier accident, then the track gets closed. In case of a normal incident like a technical breakdown, then it might be that it's just getting under yellow. First of all, we've got marshals around and permanent contact to our operators here in the entrance. We've got an emergency number and what we are now having also from 2021 on is that we are starting to provide the Nordschleife with camera operators. So that is a speed limit. We have just hit a speed limit for this corner and I can see why. And then as soon as you pass this line? Yep! Off we go. Two years ago, we had statistics that every 15,000 kilometres, an incident is happening on the NÃ¼rburgring. But an incident might also be a car losing fluid, some technical issues, but also of course, an accident. I think the biggest difference is when you've got an accident on a normal road, it takes quite a time until you've got some emergency, here, we've got around 60 people of track safety and track operators making this track as safe as possible. There's a banked turn? [Tom laughs] There isn't another racetrack like the Nordschleife. It just built into the landscape. Normally, landscapes are constructed for racetracks. Out of the way! It is so challenging because it's so narrow and it's so long. The barriers are so close to the racetrack and yeah, I guess that's what makes it challenging, but what also the drivers love. Little jump. 3, 2, 1, here. Oh, boy! [Tom laughs] And across the line! Wow! I hope you enjoyed it. Oh, yes! That was incredible! I have never done anything like that before. I like racing now! I like racetracks. Wow. Every time, every time I've done something like this, I've gone in thinking I'm going to hate it. I've gone in thinking it's going to be terrible, I'm going to be terrified. And every time I've loved it. Yes! I loved every second of that. I want to do that again. Thank you so much to Andy, my driver. Thank you so much to all the team here at the NÃ¼rburgring. Oh, that's wonderful!"
233,Three strange river crossings,"Today, I had a couple of meetings near Manchester, and I had a bit of spare time, so I visited three river crossings, all a bit strange, and all with something in common. Although, I guess technically these are canal crossings. But some of the canal is a diverted river. So... I went with river crossings, it sounds better. My first stop was the Hulmes Ferry, and I took my GoPro and my drone with me. Like all the three crossings, the Hulmes Ferry goes over the Manchester Ship Canal. That canal runs for nearly 60 kilometres, starting in the Mersey Estuary in the Irish Sea near Liverpool, and running through to Manchester. It's more than a century old. The canal is a massive engineering achievement. But it's not like the builders just smashed through anything that was in their way. It was the Industrial Revolution, but still. The Act of Parliament that gave permission for the canal, back in 1885, included a lot of requirements to make sure all the landowners along the route were... well, if not happy, at least satisfied. Embankments or channels had to be maintained or built, access had to be provided, fees had to be paid. 300 pages of technical legal details, some of which still apply to this day. Also, you'd think that by now, every bit of UK law would be online and freely available, but no, I found most of this in archived Freedom of Information on obscure things from years ago. Anyway. One of those legal requirements from 1885 is a ferry, ""by night and by day whenever required"", to replace a low bridge they had to knock down. If I'm being honest, there's not really much need to have a ferry like that in the 21st century. You wouldn't start a new ferry service there today. Yes, it was useful in the past, it's an hour's walk to get to the other side... but unless you happen to live really close to one side and work really close to the other, it's not much use. For almost every practical purpose, it's quicker to drive. There are regular passengers: so the ferry driver said in an interview a couple of years ago, but not many. It's mostly walkers and cyclists out for the fun of it. But my travel on it was logged, one more on the count of ""people who actually use this ferry"". And I'll get back to why that happened later. A few kilometres west was my second stop, the Thelwall Ferry. Actually, it might be ""Tell-wall"". I didnât meet anyone to ask, and thereâs no official web site or information about it, but itâs much the same arrangement, although this time with a small charge. Eleven pence. Oh, and that boat doesn't have an engine, it's just powered by a hard-working man rowing you across, just as there's been for more than 120 years. Not the same man, obviously, and not the same boat either. And when I turned up, there was a small sign in the window of the ferryman's cottage, saying that the service was suspended due to low water levels in the canal. I'll be honest, those water levels looked fine to me, but I'm not the expert. Low water levels aside, the ferry continues, because the law says that âthe Company shall work the said ferry whenever requiredâ. The Company, by the way, is called the Peel Group these days, after a lot of buying and selling and corporate renaming and mergers. They're an enormous property investment firm who own the entire Manchester Ship Canal along with what seems like every major bit of land and private infrastructure around Manchester. I've reached out to them with interview requests before for other stuff, and they've always turned me down, so for this video I have to rely on secondary sources, newspaper articles and quotes. I don't like doing that, but from the look of some of those articles, it's not just me that they've turn down requests from. Which is fair, they're absolutely within their rights to do that. And, if I'm honest, the second reason that I'm sorta-improvising here and relying on those quotes and articles... I only found out I was travelling to Manchester yesterday morning! So I had to spend the entire rest of the day just researching at home trying to get the law right. So: the Thelwall Ferry. Or Tell-wall. About 600 crossings a year, they say: some days there's barely anyone, other days a whole walking club might turn up and want to go across at eleven pence each. The third crossing, inbetween those two ferries, is the Warburton Toll Bridge. Which is a deeply frustrating bridge for a lot of people, because the toll to cross in a car is twelve pence. Or 25 pence, if you want a day pass. And there is often a queue. Cash only, no change given. And it seems almost farcical to have a toll collector, and a barrier, and sometimes very long queues... for twelve pence a time. Except: when I got there and I drove upâ¦ No charges! But, wanting to get the shot, I turned round and went back over, and they were charging that way, but no day passes either. Just a man with a coin bucket and no change. Uh... no daily ticket? That's 20p then! Thank you. [Toll operator] ""Right, cheers pal."" One of the nice things about improvising this video is that Iâve seen things as they actually were, not as the PR teams would want them to be. Anyway, this toll. It made sense when the bridge was built. ""For every Carriage drawn or propelled by Steam or any Means other than Animal Power, ""Two Shillings and Sixpence"". Back then, that was worth collecting, adjusted for inflation, that'd be about Â£15. But the law did not mention inflation. The company could choose to waive the tolls at any time, they did that during the Covid lockdown last year, and I guess they're doing that one way now. But if you stop collecting tolls for the long term, it's a lot more difficult to bring them back. And they'd still be required to maintain the bridge. If there's one car in each direction every 30 seconds on average, and looking at that, yeah, there is: well, that's still about a quarter million pounds of revenue every year. So you'll see people talk about story of old quirky British laws that mean you still have these ferries, and you still that toll bridge, oh, and they must be maintained by law, and isn't it weird what happens in rural Britain? But I don't think the law is the reason those crossings are still there. Because there are two ways you could interpret ""whenever required"" in those old legal documents. ""Whenever required"" could mean: whenever anyone asks for it. If someone turns up, any hour of any day, the ferry must be there waiting for them. It's a valid interpretation, but that's not how those words been read through history. And it's not how they're being read now. The Hulmes ferry only runs for a few hours, three or four days a week, and never in winter. And it stopped running for a year back in 2010, it took a campaign and local effort to get it reinstated. As for the Thelwall Ferry, it runs most days, but only for a few hours. And apparently not when the waterâs low? Remember I said my crossing was logged and counted? Well, you can also interpret ""whenever required"" to mean ""if there is reasonable demand"". There's an unofficial web site for the Hulmes ferry, and it says: ""use it or lose it"". Those old laws mention other ferries. They've all gone. I don't know if they were removed through legal process or just forgotten about, because ultimately: no-one's complaining. And if someone did complain, who in government is going to take action about a ferry that almost no-one uses? I think these ferries, and the 12 pence toll, have stuck around because it would be more effort for the giant corporation to try and stop them. It's a minor thing for a multi-billion-pound company to pay for a couple of ferry-boats, compared to having to deal with angry locals and bad press. And I think the toll on that bridge has stayed at 12 pence for so long because increasing it would have required a change in the law, and trying to get that is way more time-consuming and expensive than just keeping things as they are. In our own lives, we all make do with a lot of small bothersome things and irritations because it's less work than trying to fix them. Different scale, same principle. Although I'm not saying the ferries are a bothersome thing, I think they're brilliant, I think we should have more quirky useful things funded by multi-billion-dollar corporations. I'm just saying that the company has many bigger things to deal with. If they wanted to, they could probably get away without the ferries. And at a guessâ¦ I reckon it's not worth the hassle of not running them. But one thing is changing soon. That bridge needs expensive refurbishment, maybe even replacement soon. Which means that the company has noticed it, and suddenly changing the law might be worth their time. There was a consultation process for the locals last month. The company would like to raise the toll up to a whole... ...one pound. And replace the ticket booths with automatic systems. So if you do want the novelty of the 12 pence toll... now's the time to go. Because the law will probably change quite soon. As for the ferries... I do hope that the locals will make sure that removing them never becomes the easy option."
234,I took the world's shortest flight. It was underwhelming.,"This is the airport on Papa Westray,  one of the smallest of the Orkney Islands, off the tip of Scotland.  It is just a windsock, and a hut,  and a gravel runway. I didn't pick a great day  to travel to this tiny little island. The rain is going to return in just a few minutes, but it's still been a nice little trip out to visit the world's  oldest still standing house. [wind and rain noise] It's raining sideways.  ...and also watch some seabirds.  From quite a distance.  That's a bird. ...that's a bird. That is also a bird. But leaving here, I'm taking the world's  shortest commercial flight from this airport to the next island, a mile away. Which sounded like a great video.  But as I started to write the script,  I found some problems.  It's a commercial flight  and it's August 2021 as I record this. So masks are required,  which won't look great. And the planes in use on this route are incredibly loud and rattly. You wouldn't hear a thing.  And I'm not going to be the jackass  who's vlogging on a tiny little plane with other passengers on it, loudly  talking and bothering people and accidentally poking a selfie  stick in someone's face.  I'm just going to swap this GoPro out for a 360-camera, and just record voiceover afterwards. But... a video about commercial aviation  logistics, using voiceover? Well, that doesn't sound like me.  That sounds like something that the Wendover Productions channel would do. So, Sam? Hey there, Tom!  I'm going to leave this up to you. I'm going to go catch my flight. Spanning a distance of  1.7 miles or 2.7 km over some 80-or-so seconds, the flight Tom's about to take might seem an affront to logic, economics, environmentalism and more. But the world's shortest flight has  a very real purpose for very real people. You see, the Orkney Islands are a sparsely-populated archipelago. The vast majority of their 22,000-strong  population lives on what's known, despite its island status,  as the ""mainland"", leaving only about 4,000  on the outer islands. These outer islanders need ways  of getting to the mainland, of course, but bridges are expensive,  especially over some of the longer  interisland spans in the Orkneys. And while ferries do operate  throughout the archipelago, they're slow and lack a direct connection  to onward travel. Therefore, the answer is airplanes. Of course, flying is expensive.  And in the world of commercial aviation,  it's typically the case that the lower the demand,  the more expensive it is for an airline to operate a route  on a per passenger basis. That's because smaller destinations lack  the economies of scale afforded by operating larger airplanes  more frequently at larger airports. So air service to places with 600 or 90  residents like Westray and Papa Westray is essentially impossible  on a free market basis. The fares would be enormous per passenger,  meaning people wouldn't choose to fly. Meaning there wouldn't be enough  passengers to fill a plane. Therefore, flights to Westray and Papa  Westray are subsidized through the UK's public service obligation scheme,  meaning only a small portion of Loganir's revenue is earned through  selling the flight's Â£17 or Â£18 tickets. Still, filling a nine-passenger plane  to Papa Westray, in particular, with its 90-person population would be  difficult even at rock bottom prices. Price elasticity only goes so far. Therefore, Loganair uses a network design  referred to as a ""milk run"". Essentially, it means operating a plane  like a bus or train. In this case, the BN-2 Islander aircraft leaves Kirkwall, the largest town in the Orkneys, with passengers  destined for Papa Westray and Westray. Then it lands in Papa Westray,  drops off any passengers destined for that island and picks up any passengers  traveling to Westray and Kirkwall. Next, it flies those 80 or so seconds to Westray, drops off its passengers and picks up any final travelers headed for Kirkwall. This way, it aggregates the cumulative  demand of two islands onto one flight, allowing for operations to each more regularly than if they both had dedicated flights. Altogether, this means the only people  that might take the flight exclusively between Papa Westray and Westray  are aviation enthusiasts and tourists who make the pilgrimage to fly  on the world's shortest commercial flight. Tom, however, is returning to Kirkwall. Sam, thank you so much.  There's a link to Sam's channel,  Wendover Productions,  in the description and on screen. And sure enough,  the plane spent two minutes on the ground  while one passenger disembarked and the pilot filled out some paperwork,  and then we were off in the air again."
235,"I helped cover a 5,000-year-old monument with worn-out tires","It may not look like much,  but that is one of the most important archeological sites in Western Europe. When I say it's prehistoric, I mean that literally. The ruins that are buried here at Ness of Brodgar are from around 5000 years ago, when writing hadn't really been invented. And this...  ...this is an old worn out tire. And today, a team of volunteers are putting 500 of these on top of that. The Ness of Brodgar is a huge Neolithic complex discovered in 2002 when we did geophysics across this area. Despite the size of the trenches, this only covers approximately 10% of the site. It's massive. It is a place of gathering, 5000 years ago. We can envisage hundreds of people coming here. Neolithic society wasn't a static society and through the thousand years that the Ness was in use, we see those changes reflected in the architecture. What the Ness of Brodgar has unlocked for archeologists is a huge range of information. We have many new discoveries, new types of discoveries at the Ness of Brodgar. The preservation is quite remarkable. Under nine inches of topsoil we have Neolithic walls standing. And this is because this field has never, ever been deeply plowed. The reason for the tires, and the plastic underneath, is a bit more obvious when you know where we are: the Orkney Islands, off the northern tip of Scotland. The weather here can be brutal. Sure, it's nice today. The temperature's usually mild.  We're at the end of the Gulf Stream here, so it rarely gets too hot or too cold. But we're next to the ocean. The wind is harsh and fast and it blows in salt spray. The trouble with exposing the past is that, well, you're exposing the past. As soon as it's exposed to the air, water can start getting into the very fine laminations in the building stone. And literally, you'd see these walls start to crumble at the end of each season. We cover the site with layers of plastic, then to hold all those covers in place, all these hundreds of tires. I used to live at the top of the hill just behind us, where we recorded once a gust of over 120mph. And after some of the big storms we have in the winter, despite our best efforts,  sometimes you come back to site and the corner of the polythene  and some of the tires will have actually been moved by the wind. The old tires are a practical solution.  They're free, they're heavy but they can be moved fairly easily. And they're just soft enough not to cause damage when they're on top of the plastic sheeting.  They look ugly. They're going to disappoint  any visitors for the next few months,  but it means the site is still going to be there, intact, When spring comes and archeology can start again. We have to protect it. We have to do this to the best of our abilities, because these walls have stood for over 5,000 years. And it's a top priority for us to hopefully keep them there and keep them in prime condition for the next 5,000 years. To be honest, they didn't actually need the tire there. They just gave me one so I could be out of the way of the volunteers who are doing the actual hard work."
236,The diving gondola: a strange elevator to the ocean floor,"On the north-east coast of Germany, looking out on the Baltic Sea, thereâs a tourist attraction that I think is really strange. Four of them, actually, all identical at different seaside resorts. And I think theyâre strange because theyâre modern. The Tauchgondel, the diving gondola, feels like it should be some 19th-century Industrial Revolution invention. Itâs a diving bell: a chamber that sinks under the water and lets you look out on the ocean floor. Which is only a couple of metres down at this point, sure, but this isnât like the Disneyland fake-submarines that pretend to dive using some bubbles and lighting tricks: this really does go underwater. To me, this feels like it should be some sort of overcomplicated, steam-powered thing thatâd entertain rich Bismarck-era royalty for a few years, and then fall into disrepair and turn up in a few old photos of odd bizarre seaside attractions from the past. But this? It opened in 2009. (IN GERMAN):         The technology here is modern. And with modern technology comes modern safety standards. This gondola has the opposite problem to most elevators: the average tourist isnât going to be worried that it might fall, but they are going to ask if it might get stuck down there. Or worse, that it might, uh... ...spring a leak. [horn sounds] [mechanical noises] Ha! Okay. I did not expect that. Just... having a wave right in your face is weird. I didn't expect the sound. I don't know why. But I didn't expect the sound. [deep, rumbling waves] There is one slight catch, of course: thereâs not too much usually visible in the Baltic Sea. Itâs not crystal-clear Caribbean water on the best of days, and today all those waves are churning up the ocean bed as well. So if you were hoping that sharks or huge schools of tropical fish would swim by, youâre going to be disappointed. You might get a couple of curious flounders, or a few jellyfish passing by. The novelty is being on what is, to be fair, an actual short diving expedition without needing scuba equipment or a wetsuit. But the folks here were worried that people might be disappointed if they didnât see anything... so they actually close the shutters and show a 3D film. If the goal was âsee the ocean floorâ, well, you could do that without the chamber and all the fancy mechanisms: you could set down a few big walls with thick windows in them, pump the water out, and just have a regular viewing gallery that you could stand in. But thatâs not as cool. It is a little unnerving seeing the ocean rise around you, out of your control, and itâs also a bit reassuring to surface again into the sunshine. Because in the end, itâs not about the fish. Itâs about the experience."
237,I tried to film a volcano and it was a complete disaster,"The wind's coming from behind me, the camera might get rained on, if I look tired... it's because I am. This video ended up being a disaster, there's no other word to describe it, but I have travelled too far and expended too much energy to throw it away entirely. And I have learned quite a bit of stuff about how Iceland is handling tourists flocking to its new and dangerous volcano. So, from the outskirts of Reykjavik airport, here's a story that didn't work how I expected it to, but which I hope is still interesting. First things first: Iceland has a new volcano. And it's close to the airport, and relatively easy to get to. So the plan was: film a video with a flowing river of lava behind me. And as the plane's landing, I can sort-of see the volcano out of my window, there was a lot of low fog and it was all a bit fuzzy, but the volcano was clearly erupting. So early the next morning, I meet up with Bjorn, who's my guide and drone pilot. He's very very good at his job, I've got him for one day and one day only, he's working on a dozen other projects all over Iceland this month. We drive the 45 minutes to the volcano site, and then walk along one of the tourist trails up the mountainside. I took a bit of video as we went. We've got to head up the ridgeline that you can see in the distance in that shot. It's a bit of a steep climb at the start, but it's very possible: you can see silhouettes of people up on the ridge, and there were folks of all ages going up to see lava. It takes about 90 minutes of steady climbing, give or take: sometimes we're overtaking slower tourists, sometimes we're getting out of the way so that runners from a climbing race can speed past us. I have no idea how they managed to run the downhill bit without slipping on loose rocks. But anyway, we get to an overlook point. That's not the volcano: it's just where the lava spills over into another valley when there's too much lava, like water out of an overflowing bath. And that view is our first bit of bad news. Because just a few hours earlier there was active, flowing, red-hot lava there. You could see it on the webcams that various companies have set up. Now: solid rock, on the surface at least. And Bjorn sends up the drone to see what's happening. That's his volcano drone, by the way, it's a little bit melted in a couple of places from too many close encounters with lava. And the drone goes over the main basin, and then over the crater itself, and the pictures that it sends back show the volcano is completely quiet. It has just... stopped. We keep climbing anyway, over the next ridge, to the main overlook point. Few hours earlier, we would have seen fountains of lava exploding from the main crater, and flowing through the valley. We could have climbed down and stood... maybe not next to it, but a few metres away? But as it is... there's just a lot of disappointed tourists looking at some rock. So at this point, I need to introduce you to The Graph. The Graph is data from the Iceland Meterological Office's sensors, and they track the rumblings at certain frequencies at all the seismic locations around Iceland. So when the graph for this volcano is high, it's erupting. When it's low, it's quiet. It's been erupting for a long time now. Bjorn shows me the graph on his phone, and it's clear: at 5am, the volcano just... stopped for some reason. And activity is low, and it's trending downwards. There will be no new lava for... maybe for just the day. Or maybe it's all over and it'll never erupt again. But okay. I can still make the best of this. We head down into the valley, next to the cooled lava. So the bit I was sitting on was still just slightly warm? And while we knew that bit was safe, there were other parts where there'd be semi-liquid rock underneath ready to kill you. Earlier on, we'd spotted a couple of fools walking out across the lava. Don't do that. Anyway. We set up, I make some adjustments to my script, I try to rehearse my Icelandic pronunciation a bit, which is not good, and we start. âIn March 2021, Fagrads-âsorry, I screwed that line up, let's do that again, sorry!â âIn March 2021, after months of rumblings and warning signs, âFagradalsfjall, this volcano in Iceland, finally erupted. And, uh, âwell, it's not quite as dramatic as you might hope. âYou will have noticed that there's not any moving or spraying lava behind me. âThe volcano... is not performing today. âIâm not saying donât come to the Icelandic volcano, âbut this is unpredictable... âand unpredictable things that spew molten rock aren't exactly safe. âBut I'm not here to talk about the volcano itself. The question I've got is: âhow do the folks in charge of this area deal with âan unexpected, unpredictable and potentially-lethal new tourist attraction?â Because that was going to be the main point of the video. I did't just want to go ""ooh, volcano"", because lots of people have done that, I want to talk about the infrastructure around it. I've got interviews set up the next day with someone from the Iceland government's civil defence and emergency management department, I've probably got those words in the wrong order, and with a geologist. And I know that Bjorn can provide some shots of what the volcano looks like when it's in full flow, he's got a lot of footage from many many trips he's taken over the last few months and he's never published it before. Well, he's published lots of it, but there's shots that he hasn't, so I figure okay, I can use those new shots, in context, of course, I'll tell the audience when they are, but I can make it work. So, I get the rest of my script done. Bjorn suggests that instead of going up the hill and retracing our steps back down, we walk through the valley alongside the cooled lava flow. Which sounds good, but it turns out there's a reason that hardly anyone goes that way. It looks spectacular, the lava formations look like something from another planet, there's heat haze-Actually, no, I guess that's because all the other planets are filmed in Iceland. Anyway, looks great, but it turns out it's like walking on a pebble beach, a sloped pebble beach, for kilometre after kilometre. And then we get to the bit that's a 45-degree slope down and... âAt this point, it's less climbing and more surfing...â That's a good ten, fifteen minutes of steady, slidey, ankle-wrenching descent, I fall on my arse several times. But I know to keep my centre of balance uphill, because a gentle fall back is better than tumbling all the way down, and we get back safe. I'm a bit disappointed as we get back to the car park, no other way to say it, but I'm pretty confident I can make it work in the end. Bjorn drives us back to Reykjavik, we part ways, I take a nap, I get some dinner. But we both keep an eye on the Graph. And at about 6pm, the activity starts to tick up again. 9:30, the live webcams that are pointed at the volcano, they start to show lava explosions, just in the main crater. And Bjorn knows that there's an angle, at the top of the western part of the hills, where he can get me and the crater in shot, lava behind me, and he can also send the drone over, and maybe it'll even start flowing into the valley again. It is very late, and we are so tired, but it's time to climb the volcano a second time. By the time we arrive at the car park, it's 11pm. There are a few other optimistic tourists, who I guess have looked at the same data and images we have. This time we take the western route up. Still a long climb, still a bit of scrabbling up hills, it's really really tough. We pass another dried lava flow, and we pass the giant earth wall that's been constructed to try and make sure the lava goes in a particular direction. It's midnight by the time we're approaching the top, but, it's Iceland in midsummer, so it's still light! And... we have to stop short of the crater. And we can't film. Because we reach the clouds. In the time it took us to get up there, fog has rolled in, low cloud has rolled in, and the toxic gases from the volcano are now drifting that way as well, and if we go any further it won't be safe and we won't be able to see anything anyway. The crater is so close but there's no way to get there. Bjorn sends the drone out and gets some incredibly atmospheric shots from directly over the crater, he nearly melts the camera... but all we'd see from the path is cloud and smoke. And then there's one last bit of hope. Because Bjorn noticed that there's clearly lava flowing. Maybe it's going to go down the valley and... no, it's going into a hole in the ground and it's disappearing. So we head back down. Because there's nothing more we can do. Down the hill, back to Reykjavik, in total we've spent seven or eight hours of the day hiking up and down mountainsides. Bjorn has gone above and beyond. And I figure that I've still got a couple of days left, maybe the situation will change and I can go back on my own. I won't have a drone, and without a guide I'll have to stick strictly to the tourist route, but... maybe it'll work. I can still do the interviews, too, they will help. And then I got a really bad case of food poisoning. Because I guess Icelandic-Mexican fusion cuisine was a bad idea! So now, I am physically exhausted, both from the hiking and from spending a day in my hotel room ""talking to Huey on the big white telephone"". I had to cancel the interviews. And even if the volcano had changed and started flowing over the last couple of days, which it hasn't... trying to hike for hours to somewhere with no, um, facilities, while my body is knackered, is not an option. And I can't extend my stay here. The last time I visited Iceland, I quoted Sam Hughes, science fiction author, and I'm going to do that again with a different part of their work: Iceland is the place you go to remind yourself that planet Earth is a machine, and that all the organic life that has ever existed amounts to a greasy film that has survived on the exterior of that machine thanks to furious improvisation. I did not get to see lava close-up. Volcanoes are unpredictable and dangerous, and there aren't many that are tourist attractions for exactly that reason. I did learn a few things about Icelandic infrastructure and emergency management, and I can share them with you now, so I guess: technically, mission accomplished and I've still got a video. But this is kinda my furious improvisation, not the lifesaving kind, but sometimes these things don't work out, and you've gone too far and put too much effort in to just throw it all away, and you improvise, and this is what I've got you. I wish I could wrap this story up in a neat bow, but the only way that this could possibly have a good ending is if, somehow, in the few hours just before now, just before I leave Iceland, the volcano decided to have a sudden, massive eruption, sending tens of thousands of tons of lava flowing down the hill, and by coincidence my stomach settled down as well, so I could gather what feels a bit like the very last of my strength, hike out there one more time and at least get a shot standing in front of lava. No. The volcano's just gone quiet again. I'm going to go get on a plane. And I will bet that damn volcano erupts-[muffled, with background noise] --just after I take off. Did I just pull my microphone cord out of... Well either that or it wasn't plugged in at all and none of that worked, so here's hoping!"
238,"The UK's last aerial ropeway uses no power, moves 300 tonnes a day, and will be gone by 2036.","The folks at this quarry in Claughton near Lancaster dig up about 60,000 tonnes of shale rock from the ground every year. That shale needs to get to the brickworks, about a mile and a half that way. Nowadays, you'd have some fancy underground conveyor belt or you'd just have trucks loading up and driving back and forth. But this quarry opened in the 1920s. So the solution was a bit different: an aerial ropeway. This is the last aerial ropeway in Britain. It's nearly a hundred years old. It needs no fuel and no electricity to run. And in 15 years time, it'll be gone. This ropeway was commissioned in the 1920s but we've been quarrying from this valley now for well over 150 years. An empty bucket arrives, it goes onto what we call the bull rail, so that automatically comes off the rope and it allows the rope to go around a wheel. The bucket then is dusted. If the weather is bad, the rain adheres to the bucket and the muck sticks to it. So that would reduce what is taken down to the factory and also would affect the balance of the rope. And then it's put under a feeder where a given amount of material is put into that bucket, about a quarter of a tonne. At that point, another operative takes the full bucket from under the feeder and waits until the correct positioning of the incoming bucket is in place, which allows him then to feed it onto the rope. That spacing is critical because of the way the rope works. It's gravity fed. The brickworks is downhill from here so all the power for this ropeway comes from gravity. Put the full buckets of shale on one side, going down the hill  and the empty buckets on the other side going up and you don't need an engine house or a motor. You just need brakes to regulate the speed. It takes about half an hour for a round trip. There are about 40 buckets. This ropeway will move about 300 tonnes of shale every day with no need for petrol or electricity. So let's go to the brickworks at the other end and see how it works down there. As a bucket comes in the other end, an operator is stood waiting for it. It comes off the rope at a given speed onto a bull rail, from that bull rail, the operator walks round. There's a pivot system on the bucket that tips into a hopper. At that point, it then feeds into a dump truck. The operator then puts the bucket back. When the correct space is positioned, he pushes the bucket onto the rope. It's an art to swing that bucket and tip it at the right time. They do walk quite a few miles in a day. This factory was designed to produce round-about 42 million bricks annually. And there was a Â£4.4 million investment four years ago that increased the productivity up to 50 million. Claughton produces frost-resistant product. It's down to the shale from the quarry, that's a vital key to it. The temperature we fire at and also the durability of the ceramic bond. That means we can sell this product into all extreme weathers. There's nowhere in the UK we can't sell to with our durability of the product at Claughton. Unfortunately, it has to cross the road. It's never been known, certainly in the last 50, 60 years, to come off at that point, but it is a possibility. So we have a steel bridge with big bucket-catchers on the side that would prevent that happening. The rope construction is a 25mm steel rope. Very difficult to get contractors these days who are skilled in splicing ropes of that size. We replace the rope every six years. It's a very, very difficult process, very old, the technology's the 1920s, of course. We did a computer design of a new ropeway many years ago, and unbelievably, the computer matched this design in terms of trestle heights and weights to somebody with a slide rule and a pencil. There used to be hundreds of these ropeways around Britain, in industrial sites, mines and quarries. This is the last one still operating anywhere in the country. It nearly wasn't, the financial crisis in the late 2000s meant the quarry and brickworks shut down for a few years. But it was kept in working order and as of right now, it's still transporting rock. But it has an expiry date. 31st December, 2036. Permission for quarrying was going to end in 2018 but the local council planning department granted an extension because the quarry and brickworks are still operating. There's a lot of shale still in the hill up there and literally no one objected. I checked the planning report. Environmental agencies, local residents, everyone was, like, ""Yeah fine, keep it running, that works."" Now in theory, that deadline could be extended again but the reason they picked 2036 is that by then, the company will more or less have quarried everything they can out of that hill. And one of the conditions of that time extension is that once quarrying is finished, the ropeway has to come down. The planning report does acknowledge that it's unique in the country,  it's the only one left in Britain. There is some heritage value in it, but, they say, not enough to justify saving it for posterity. This isn't like an old railway line where, if it's left unmaintained, it'll just slowly, steadily decay. It could be actively dangerous if the ropes and towers start to fall apart, particularly when they run over a road, just there. Unless money is constantly spent to keep it in working order, it'll decay into an unsafe blot on the landscape. Which is fair, but I suspect when that final day comes in about 15 years time, when the last bucket goes down the ropeway, there'll be a few people here to say goodbye to it. And until then it'll keep moving shale without needing any fuel at all. Thank you so much to all the team at Forterra for showing me around. They did ask me to make clear that the ropeway is not a tourist attraction. So if you're in the area and you want to take a couple of pictures from the road, sure! But then, for their sake, please keep driving."
239,How many robots does it take to run a grocery store?,"This is a grocery packing warehouse in the south-east of London. Folks have ordered their groceries online, and instead of people walking up and down the aisles of a traditional grocery store to pick up items, these little devices move more than a million items every day between them. Instead of trying to build machines that fit into a world designed for humans, this entire facility, the size of seven football fields, is custom-built to make this as efficient as possible. I cannot get across on camera just how incredibly large this whole place is. The top speed of those boxes is about 14 kilometres an hour and they pass within five millimetres of each other when they move. So: how many robots are there in the Hive? Well, that depends on how you count them. What you're looking at behind me is the Hive. We've got the grid, which is the metal structure, it's filled with products, so that product is housed within what we call totes or these open boxes that you can see at the top of the grid. We have around 2,300 bots and they move the stock around the warehouse, so that we can pair it up with customer orders to be delivered. The bots will move in the X and Y direction, they can also move in the Z direction. So we have a cable hoist system. That means that they can lower down a gripper assembly and grab onto the stock that we have in the grid. In some areas we have as deep as 21 totes, all in a line. We have sensors underneath the bot, that mean that every time it passes over one of the squares on the grid, it has a laser underneath it, that can tell when it moves over that cell. So it will say ""I passed a cell, I passed a cell, I passed a cell."" We have around 58,000 different types of individual products within the grid. We'll use the huge amounts of data that we gather to understand what customers are most likely to order and place them in the easiest to reach locations for bots. All of that combined means that we can have stock into the warehouse and out again from our suppliers, into a delivery van, in just five hours. The robots deliver their crates over to the packing area. Some of that packing is done by humans, but there are mechanical arms as well. One of the big problems they've got to solve is that grocery packaging is designed for people, and the interactions between all the objects they deal with can be... complicated. Currently, we're standing underneath the grid structure that we saw earlier. The robots that we saw are actually dropping off products to the station. Once they're dropped off, they become in control of the robot and the robot decides how to pick them, before the grid robot picks up their tote and takes it away again. There's two 3D cameras above the totes, so it takes an image of the storage box before it picks from it decides on the best grasp point, confirm that the product is correct, and then place it into a customer's shopping and it's doing all of that on live customer orders. We make sure that we don't mix something that was heavy with something that's soft. There are things that the robot can't pack, things such as very, very heavy, very large or very fragile items, but there's a lot of range in between that. It's fairly safe to call each individual packing arm ""a robot"".  Each one has a separate controller and it has to make a lot of decisions in real time using cameras and sensors on each individual arm. But here in the Hive, it's not quite as simple. Controlling all of this is what we refer to as the Hive Mind, so this artificial intelligence system that controls everything. Once the stock comes in, from that exact point that it enters the system, the Hive Mind will track its every single movement. The Hive Mind will tell the bots exactly where they need to stop, but it is the bot's control system that allows it to follow a movement profile and stop exactly as the hive mind expects it to. There's just a 5mm gap between bots, so that's both as they pass each other and if they stop next to a bot as well. This bot with the orange light may have experienced something within its sensors and all of those readings it's taking, that when it feeds that back to the Hive Mind, it's not quite what the Hive Mind was expecting, so it just brings it to a safe stop for investigation. We do have a number of grid operators that sit at the edge of the grid and they're able to use our CCTV system that we have above the grid to look at exactly what's going on with that bot and they can try and fix that remotely and send commands to the bot wirelessly. The boundary between ""individual"" and ""group"" is a little blurry. Is a termite colony a collection of individuals working together, or one big superorganism? Is the microbiome in your gut part of you? Because in the last couple of decades scientists have started to work out that the bacteria in your digestive system produce and consume neurotransmitters that affect how you think. But most people wouldn't consider their gut bacteria to be ""part of them"". We tend to ascribe intelligence and identity to things that act at roughly our scale. It's easy to look at the Hive, see the moving boxes and go, ""okay, 2000 robots"". But with only one controller and the boxes just following the paths they're given, I'd say there's a good argument that that is one robot... with 2,000 ways to interact with the world. Thank you so much to everyone here at Ocado. There is a link to them and more about their technology in the description."
240,Landing at the only airport that's also a public beach,[This video contains burned-in subtitles.]
241,The Accidental Rush for Anthrax Island,"This isn't the story I expected to tell here. And I want to be clear at the very start: Gruinard Island, on the west coast of Scotland, is not a tourist destination. There's not much to see, and what there is, you can see it from the mainland. But if you really do want to get closer, there is a way. And these days, the government won't even try to stop you. While I think Scottish right-to-roam law would allow us to land this boat and have a walk around, the owners of the island asked that I don't. And that's fair enough. One of the reasons I want to respect that request is because there is quite a history of Englishmen coming up to the Scottish Highlands and, uh, acting like we own the place. Gruinard Island here? In World War 2, this is where Britain tested its biological weapons. It was contaminated for decades, and landing was dangerous and illegal. It has another unofficial name: Anthrax Island. ...and traditionally at this point, television crews go into the history of the place, and there'd be a lot of pontificating about whether Britain would ever have actually used lethal anthrax bacteria as a weapon. The government has always maintained that the experiments on Gruinard Island sheep here were just for defence, to have data in case we were attacked, or as an early form of mutually-assured-destruction. All the records I found back that up, but who knows what was said quietly in private. Britain did draw up theoretical attack plans. That seems abhorrent now. But in times of war, the laws fall silent. This video isn't about that. I'm telling you that story so I can tell you something else I found while researching. Because it's often difficult to find truth about history like this: so before travelling up here, I went to look at original documents in the National Archives. It's really amazing to me that researchers can just ask for those. All the details are there: how much anthrax the scientists used in each test, how many sheep were killed and how, the dimensions of the clouds of anthrax given off, and the scientists' comments about just how effective it was. But that's been well told, in books, in articles, in all sorts of ways. It's been badly told as well, like in an overdramatic US TV segment from 2001, where the journalist wears a completely unnecessary respirator and hazmat suit. And he didn't need those because in the 1980s, the island was decontaminated. Partly because of pressure and petitions from the public, and there was also more startling pressure, when an anonymous group calling themselves Dark Harvest Commando dumped anthrax-contaminated soil outside one of the English government research labs. The people responsible were never tracked down. And while all that was going on, modern tourism had become a thing: in 1982, the government had to deal with a couple of Europeans on holiday who just landed on the island in an inflatable dinghy and had a walk around, unaware of the danger that was still there. There's a letter in the archives from the British Embassy, and it's this wonderful bit of diplomatic writing. And it's among those more modern documents that I stumbled on a story about Gruinard Island that I don't think has ever been told, because in context it's a fairly minor detail. But out of all the stories about the island, this is the one that stood out to me. So it's 1986. The decontamination was successful, the government used tonnes and tonnes of formaldehyde disinfectant, which killed a few other things apart from the anthrax, but the ecosystem was steadily starting to recover from that. For the government, it all seemed to be going well. The press coverage was mostly positive, they got a lot of attention for doing a good thing, for finally cleaning up an old mess. And of course the public's interested in the whole thing, ""newly cleaned-up secret wartime anthrax-contaminated island"" is the sort of thing that attracts people's attention. And it was being sold for only Â£500! Slight catch there. It was being sold for Â£500 back to the original owners. Because the government, correctly, was honouring the original contract from the 1940s, which specified that once the island was safe again, the folks who'd sold it to the government, or those people's descendants, they'd have the option of buying it back. For the same price they sold it for, Â£500. It was worth much much more than that, but Â£500 was the price, and Â£500 they'd pay. What this did not mean was that there was a bargain-basement private Scottish Island on sale. But the trouble is that the press can sometimes gloss over some of those details. And as the decontamination story went out in newspapers and magazines and TV broadcasts, several government departments found themselves dealing with a rush of letters and telephone calls from the public, all asking if they could buy the island for Â£500. ""It has come to my attention that the island of Gruinard is for sale. ""I am interested in making an offer to purchase."" I realise that getting voice actors to read the letters out does make them a bit funny, but I don't want to mock the people sending the letters. They weren't ignorant, they'd just been told by an apparently-reliable source that there was a private Scottish island available for Â£500. I'd ask about that. I might even try and beat the offer. ""The price offered is Â£500. I am prepared to offer Â£501 immediately."" One woman from Glasgow wrote: ""The fear of anthrax pales into insignificance to me, ""as I have lived adjacent to a council rubbish dump for nearly three years."" And it wasn't just British people. The enquiries came from all over the world. Germany, Ethiopia, Bahrain, the UAE, New Zealand, a couple from homesick Scottish immigrants to Australia. ""I often long for the old country."" People wrote to any department that they thought might be relevant: the Scottish Office, the Ministry of Defence. A man from Australia wrote directly to the Prime Minister offering a thousand dollars. ""Please forgive me for writing directly to you, Mrs Thatcher, ""but I am hoping you will forward this tender to the correct department."" That one arrived three months after the first ones. This took a long time to clear up. Not all the incoming letters are in the archives, probably not all the replies either. There are also a couple of grumpy memos from civil servants passing the buck to one another about dealing with the letters and the phone calls. I do wonder if any of these writers thought their letter would someday end up preserved in a national archive. This isn't ancient history, that's why I've blocked out their personal details. And I love this story. Because it shows that misinformation is not a new thing. Misunderstandings are not a new thing. Even now, if you Google ""who owns Gruinard Island"" you'll find an article about how Russian oligarchs want to buy it... dated April 1st, 2018. April Fools' Day is a curse and we should abandon it. And anyone who's ever been in the public eye, even briefly, knows that one wrong word can come back to haunt you for years. It might not even be your word: the press might misquote you, or take you out of context, and somehow the world gets the impression that, for example, for example, you're the person to call about a surprisingly cheap Scottish island that doesn't have anthrax any more."
242,The beach where Lego keeps washing up,"This isn't the story I expected to tell. I knew, coming here, that this isn't some magic beach where you can bring a shovel and scoop up buckets and buckets of Lego. It might've felt a bit like that twenty years ago, but these days Lego is a little harder to find. But yes, here on the coast of Cornwall, in the south-west of England, when the conditions are right, you might find quite a bit of Lego scattered on Perranporth beach. In 1997, a container ship called Tokio Express was on its way to New York when it got hit by a heavy storm  off Land's End, just west of here. A load of containers got knocked into the sea. And one of them contained almost 5 million little plastic pieces of Lego. Most of which were ocean themed. Flippers, spears, octopuses, all crashing around in the waves and currents. The far end of this beach has the right conditions. There's a huge expanse of sand, the wind is in the right direction, but the pieces can wash up anywhere. That's the nice, cute story that I was going to tell. We find the Lego after high spring tides and winter storms. And that's when the waves will eat into the dunes and release a lot of the plastic that's been washed ashore many years ago. That's Tracey Williams. She's been beachcombing here for years and runs a photography project called Lego Lost at Sea. Tracey didn't want to be on camera, which is frankly sensible. But she was nice enough to show off some of her Lego collection, to take me beachcombing here on the far end of the beach, and to chat about what she's found over the years. So I got my GoPro ready. We went out for a walk on the shore. And that's where the story I thought I was going to tell didn't work anymore. When you've got it in a little jar [Tracy laughs] with all the bright colours, it looks almost quaint. And then the reality is a bit different. No, the reality is horrifying, isn't it? So if you look here, see. Absolutely full. So this is actually a plastic pebble. Plastic? Yeah. How can you tell the difference? Feel the weight. Oh, huh! Nobody really knows where they're coming from, but they're thought to be the remains of beach bonfires. So I've actually picked up 20,000 of those. It's actually from an ale cask. These are from packaging strips. These are what they put round cartons to protect them from packaging. Shotgun wads, shotgun cartridges. Bottle caps. I mean, what do you do with... like, you've just got to bring a trash bag and just... Yeah, so I normally come down armed with sacks. That's a glow stick from fishing. So that's the valve off a tyre. Oh yeah! So these get discarded on garage forecourts and tyre places, and they just get washed into the drains. And the drains go straight to the sea. A lot will be litter dropped on the streets. 80% of litter dropped on the streets is said to make its way to the sea. Wow. It's not just Lego, that's the way people like to tell it but it's not just Lego. It's so many plastic things and it's not just this beach. Once you start looking... immediately, bright white, bright blue, bright yellow. Yeah. If I was looking at this from a distance, I would have just read it all as seaweed. It's actually not as bad today, as it sometimes is, but I can't see how it's ever going to get better in a way it's a sort of pointless exercise, constantly picking it up. I've just got a sort-of creeping horror at this point. Do you get used to that? Get used to seeing this amount of plastic? Yeah. Yeah. There's this clichÃ© in horror movies, where the characters suddenly realise that the monster that they've heard about, this abstract thing, is actually in the room with them and has been there the whole time, and that's kind of what this felt like, because I've been going to beaches like this all my life and I'd never noticed the bright colours that were right in front of me. So on this beach, you get a lot of the floating plastic. So you've got all the fragments of plastic. You got the nurdles, these little tiny nurdles. Those aren't stones? Those are... No, these are little plastic nurdles. These are the raw material that all plastic items are made from. There's billions of them. So some are nurdles. You also get ones that are black and ridged and they're actually biobeads that are used in waste-water treatment plants. And then you sort-of pull back the camera and you realise that it's all of this. There's so much of it. On some beaches, you get the plastic that sinks to the ocean floor and it washes ashore with the kelp, with the brown seaweed. They've probably been swirling around the seabed for the last 24 years, and every now and again they wash ashore with the seaweed. And this goes down, then? We assume it does. So a lot of it is is buried under where we are now. Just needs to come out. Quite a lot of the toys we find, you can date them. And some date back to the 50s and 60s. Especially the cereal packet toys. We recently did some experiments in the lab to see how long Lego would last in the marine or coastal environments, and the scientists that did the experiments worked out that it could last up to 1300 years. I wonder if one day you'll just be able to recognise it by the colour. Yeah. Bright green of the seaweed or the yellow of the lifeboats. Ah, look, treasure! Treasure? Is that one of the dwarves from Snow White? It's not every beach, but it's a lot of them. Tucked away in corners where the tourists don't go or just in plain sight. There was seaweed on another beach filled with plastic. Once you see it...! I've just seen a Lego broom. Yes. Just there? Yes. What do you know? Thank you. Among all the other plastic waste, there still is Lego washing up. Did they used to be more Lego? Has it changed over the years? Yes. I think there's definitely less Lego than there used to be. And there's lots of people looking out for it now. You only ever see what floats really. You never really hear about all the items from cargo spills that sink to the bottom of the sea. Because the rest of it is going to be out on the ocean floor somewhere. Yeah. That's bleak. [both laugh] I don't have a neat ending for the story. I was going to say, ""Oh, if you're on the beach in south-west England, !it's worth keeping your eyes down from time to time. ""Maybe you'll see some Lego!"" But even if you don't, maybe take a bag with you and take some plastic away, because there's a lot of it. The Lego Lost at Sea project is on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and there's also a link to pre-order Tracey's book down in the description. [chuckles] If I looked slightly distracted during that it's because halfway through I realised that there is green nylon rope just in the seaweed, just hanging out there."
243,England's oldest attraction turns teddy bears to stone,"Tucked away in the picturesque little village of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, is Mother Shipton's Cave. And the publicity claims that it is ""England's oldest still-surviving tourist attraction"". Good luck fact-checking that, but I can't find anything else that's been charging an admission fee for nearly 400 years. To be fair, good luck fact-checking anything in this story. It's likely that there was a woman called Mother Shipton who lived about 500 years ago, but after that, actual certified references are shaky at best. She's said these days to have been a witch and a prophet who lived in a cave with a pool shaped like a skull that turned things to stone. We all grow up in this area hearing about Mother Shipton, and so we grew up with her prophecies. We're talking about the year 1488. There was a young lady called Agatha Sontheil, was cast out of the town of Knaresborough at the age of 15 because she was having a baby. So, she came to these woods and, in the cave, gave birth to a baby girl called Ursula Sontheil. She was born, it is said, with a hunched back, but she was also a very, very clever young lady. At the age of five, she went to the medieval equivalent of school. She left school at 15. At the age of 20, she got married to a carpenter by the name of Tobias Shipton. But by this time, she was having visions about the future and news of her prophecies was starting to spread. There was a lot of superstition about her. She was already learning to hate authority, and some people thought she was a witch. There was a bridge at the entrance to the park. Now, Mother Shipton said, ""When the High Bridge in Knaresborough has fallen thrice, ""the end of the world is nigh."" Not to get you worried, it has been down twice already. But there are more roadworks across that bridge than anywhere else in this area and I can assure you it's very solid. We'll never know which of the many, many stories about Mother Shipton's life were actually true. She's a folk legend. And unless the laws of physics have changed in the last few centuries, she couldn't actually see the future. But the pool that turns objects to stone? Well, that is real. And at some point a few centuries ago, some enterprising local decided to start charging admission. This park used to belong to the Royal Family. It was bought by Sir Charles Slingsby from King Charles I in 1630. Sir Charles was a canny Yorkshire man who decided a pretty penny could be made from this place, hence guided tours commenced here in that year. Not me, I have to add! Before he bought this, it had a very, very bad press. People, being superstitious, would find animal skeletons, leaves turning to stone, and they actually thought people would turn to stone. He soon realised he was onto a good thing here. The waters consist of iron, zinc, magnesium, aluminium, calcium carbonate. There's a stream which is underground, and it comes to the surface just before you come down to this well. It comes to the surface, it goes over the wellhead, and when it drops down, it'll turn anything to stone because of the various chemicals it's picked up. And it became known as a health cure. People would bathe in the water and drink the water. It it supposed to cure rheumatism. It's not recommendable today with modern health and safety(!) This isn't true petrification. The material isn't being replaced with stone. But at the risk of making some chemists angry at me, I think it's close enough. The water here is so rich in minerals, carbonates and sulphates, that it acts like stalactites forming in a cave or limescale building up on your plumbing. The teddy bears, the hats, the whatever's in here, it's steadily being coated in minerals over and over and over again. And if it's porous, it becomes solid enough that, yeah, it turns to stone. Chemically, maybe not. Linguistically? Sure, I'll take that. Now, with regard to the objects that you see up there, it's got to be anything porous. The smaller the object is, the shorter time it takes. A teddy would take about three months. Anything bigger would take six months to a year. It does freeze in winter. Icicles come right down to the floor, and it's quite spectacular. It's been flowing since the ice age. The other remarkable thing about the water is it flows at the same rate all the time: 700 gallons an hour. It never varies, drought or flood. It's again one of the wonders of the well: it never dries up. Mother Shipton's Cave is still a tourist attraction. They still charge money to do the nice long walk through the park  and then come and marvel at the pool that turns things to stone. But before theme parks, before American roadside attractions, before seaside tourist traps, there was a cave, a good story, and someone who wanted to make some money off it. And they still sell the teddy bears in the gift shop."
244,This changed my mind about aquariums.,"I got an email from an aquarium, and it changed my mind about aquariums. Because biology and zoology... never really interested me all that much. For me, somewhere like this, The Deep in the city of Hull, wasn't somewhere I'd visit because, yes, important for conservation, vital for science, but... it's just some fish, right? But then they sent me an email and asked me if I'd be interested in looking at their life-support system. Now, I've only ever heard the words ""life-support system"" in the context of spaceflight, either realistic, like the oxygen scrubbers and water recyclers on the International Space Station, or in... less realistic situations. Life-support systems sustaining on emergency. But The Deep, here? It has a life-support system. We are a closed system. So, much like your spaceship, we are isolated. There's no input or output to the oceans whatsoever. The water inside that system or exhibit is constantly recirculating between the exhibit and the life-support system. So, everything that we have here, we have to control, including making our own seawater. The water starts off, just as it would in your home, out of the tap. Now, the water is very, very hard around here. It's lots of calcium carbonate in the water, so the first thing we have to do is soften it, so that is the removal of that calcium and magnesium ions from the water. So, these are full of an ionic resin, and they scavenge those ions out of the water. We don't want calcium to build up in our life-support systems, on our heating elements. So, what we're left with, in this great container over here is roughly 30,000 litres of softened water that has gone through this reverse osmosis machine. It's basically pumping water across a very fine membrane under very high pressure to give us very, very pure water. To that pure water we then add artificial sea salt. We then pump it around where needed around the building. So, this is a really good example of a small-scale life-support system that we would use for some small stand-alone tanks, like this research system here. Now, this has got all the components of a life-support system that you would normally find in an aquarium like this, and this is all scaled up on a huge scale for things like our large 2.5-million-litre system. What we have at the back here, that's a foam fractionator. So, all of these micro bubbles that are being injected at the base of this foam fractionator are scavenging organic molecules. Now, these molecules and compounds are actually hydrophobic. They don't like water. And what they want to do is they want to adhere to the surface of this micro bubble. And they rise to the surface, and we then remove them via the cone at the top. This is a bio tower. So, fish excrete ammonia and urea. Now, we have to convert those to less toxic forms. Inside here, we have a lot of bio-balls, and that is a huge, huge surface area. The bacteria that live on these bio-balls are converting it through to nitrite, then to nitrate, and we can then complete that process by reducing that to nitrogen gas, which can just off-gas into the atmosphere. We've got the sand filtration here. So, water enters the top of this unit. It goes through a bed of sand, which scavengers out all those particulates in the water, and then exits the bottom clean. One of the last steps in the life-support process is ultraviolet light. It breaks down cell membranes. So, we're really looking at anti-microbial action within these units. So, water is constantly recirculating between the life-support system and the exhibit. As I talked to the team here, I realised that, sure, you can call this an aquarium, but you could also call it ""a spaceship for sharks"". You've got creatures contained in a higher pressure environment. And okay, it's not the vacuum of space out here, sure. But if these walls are somehow breached, the environment inside will spray out. And if it's not fixed quickly, those fish are dead. And if that environment isn't controlled  and maintained constantly and carefully, they're also dead. And that takes a lot more equipment and a lot more precision than you might think. So, just as we have a small foam fractionator on our smaller life-support systems, this is the scale of this skimmer on our large system. Now, this is part of the building, it's so huge. Now, a key part of maintaining this is making sure the mixture of gas is correct that we're pumping into it. So, here we have a gas panel. Now, this is where we alter the mixture of air and ozone  that is going into the super-skimmer. So, that's helping to break down those organic particles, molecules, so that the skimming can be that much more efficient. So, we're going down into the heart of the building now, into the basement, and that's where the really large life-support equipment is located, some of which is so large it forms the fabric of the building itself and the pipework is built into the ground. So, we're now three floors down, and we're only just at the base of the super-skimmer. We saw the cone right at the top. Now, we're right down at the base, so it just gives you a sense of scale for how big that super-skimmer actually is, and how much a part of the building it actually is. The water then comes back out of the super-skimmer and enters our giant sand filters. We need to remove all the particulates out of the water, those little pieces that you might see floating around, bits of food, things like that. So, here we have some very large banks of UV. So, water is constantly passing and exposing microbes to that UV light. And then the last step in the process is the huge pumps over there take the water and pump it back into the main exhibit and we start the whole process over and over again. It happens constantly, and the water is going round and round completely about once every three hours. So, here we are above our main exhibit, Endless Oceans. Now, this is a tropical marine system. It's 2.5 million litres. It's 10 metres deep. And in here is where we keep all of our really key species, including some that are unfortunately now critically endangered in the wild. We do call it a life-support system because it is doing exactly that: it is sustaining life. We're controlling every single water parameter in order that the species that we're keeping here are thriving. We are responsible for every single life at The Deep. Thank you so much to all the team at The Deep in Hull. There's a link to them down in the description. And thank you to my dive cameraman, Tom!"
245,No-one is going to save Covehithe,"It is a cold and bleak day here. There are lots of towns and villages around the world that once existed, but have been lost to the sea or under floodwaters. But here, on the south-east coast of Britain, there's a village that's still around but won't be for too long. Up behind those cliffs is Covehithe. It's a picturesque little village. There's the ruins of a church more than 600 years old, with a more recent church built inside. And by more recent, I mean the little church is only 400 years old. There's farmland, a few houses, a couple of dozen residents. This has been a settlement for least a thousand years, possibly more. And it'll be gone by the end of the century. You can see on old maps just how much land has already been lost to the sea. The cliffs here get eroded a little bit with every high tide, steadily being pushed back and back and back. There are warning signs to stop people from walking on top, because the ground near the edge will be loose and could fall with just a little bit of pressure from above. And this has been happening for centuries. It can't go on forever: at some point, no-one knows when, the process should stabilise at a new equilibrium. But no-one can model that far ahead. For the forseeable future, the local council's management plan estimates that the coastline will move inland by about four or five metres every year. There's a lot of margin for error, but even in the best-case scenario, Covehithe is gone in 100 years. Worst-case, 30 years. It won't actually crumble into the ocean: to avoid pollution, buildings around here are demolished and taken away when their time comes. And presumably someone will have to move the church's graveyard. So why doesn't anyone save Covehithe? The landowners here did offer to build their own coastal defences back in 2011, to add breakwaters here as an experiment to see if the erosion could be slowed, but they were turned down by the council. This beach, where they'd need to build, is owned by the government. And the government said no because... the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. A little way down the coast is Southwold, home to a thousand people and a lot of tourism. And the simulations say that if Covehithe stops eroding, then Southwold would probably start. Or at least, they'd need much, much stronger defences. It's not practical to save every building everywhere: this is miles of coastline and they'd need to defend all of it, constantly, into eternity. The council's plan is clear: ""it is not considered sustainable to attempt to manage the erosion"". I did ask both the landowners and the council for a comment, but neither got back to me. Perhaps because Covehithe isn't a tourist attraction, and I don't think they'd want to be. There are no amenities for visitors, there's no little tea shop by the beach. But if you do happen to be somewhere in the area in the next few years, it might be worth stopping by to see Covehithe... while you can."
246,The never-used road where the BBC crash cars,"Most of us, at some point in our lives, have abandoned a project half way through. But most of us don't have that abandoned project sitting on full, permanent display to the world. This is the Road to Nowhere,Â  in Yate, in south-west England. Let's go for a walk. This is 400m of never-completed 1970s highway that goes from a roundabout to... well, nowhere, it's cut off by a railway line. I'm actually a little bit amazed thatÂ  I only just found out about this, because ""half-completed road to nowhere"", with lane markings and kerbs and everything, is very much the sort of thing that I'd expectÂ  younger me to have filmed five years ago. And this place is not a secret.Â  This is a big public common. There's folks walking their dogs here. The public can't drive on thisÂ  road, though: it's gated off. If you look at aerial photos, youÂ  can see where it was meant to go. There's another roundabout a little wayÂ  over there that it would have connected to, completing a small ring road around the town. And you can see exactly what theÂ  plan was... it just never happened. And yes, there are a lot of complaintsÂ  about the traffic in this town. Also on those aerial photos: some heavy equipment, and a fakeÂ bridge being built just down there. See, this road does have a use. The local council makes it available for filming, the whole area is closed occasionallyÂ  for television shows to shoot on. And they can make it look likeÂ  either a small country road or a big highway depending onÂ  where they point their camera. Broadchurch used carefulÂ  angles and one composite shot to make it look like a coast road. And hospital drama Casualty haveÂ  shot quite a few things here over the 36 years they've been in production. That includes their most expensive scenes ever, which involved a huge fakeÂ bridge, crashing vehicles, adding a CGI town around the road, and setting off an enormous tanker explosion. For all it cost, it's actuallyÂ  a little bit underwhelming? Maybe that's a creative decision,Â  maybe it looks more realistic that way. And it's convincing enough. This is an accidental film set. At some point, some British studio wouldÂ  probably have built one of these anyway, it just wouldn't look as good. So the question is: why did this happen? I don't actually know. I gave up onÂ  researching this project half way through. Okay, no, I'm just kidding, accordingÂ  to one former local councillor, it's because the price of steel suddenly went up, the council didn't want to pay thatÂ much for the railway bridge over there, so they put the whole thing on hold, and no-one ever started theÂ  project up again afterwards. There are still occasional vagueÂ  political calls to complete it, but I would be very surprisedÂ  if there's any traffic other than stunt drivers and dog walkers on the Road to Nowhere any time soon."
247,We walked the most dangerous path in Britain,"Welcome to Foulness Island. The name is unfortunate. It either meant 'muddy headland' or possibly 'bird headland' a few centuries ago. It's about nine square miles, there's around 150 people who live on it. But unless you are one of those people or you've got business with them, you will not be allowed in. Most of the island and, importantly, the road and bridge that get you onto it: they're owned by the British military and they will turn you away. But despite having no business here, I am on the island, legally. And that's because I didn't use the road and bridge. I walked along a very different path to get here. The Broomway has been called the most dangerous, most deadly path in Britain. It goes back at least 600 years. And the only reason that I walked here safely is because I had a guide. A few miles back before we set off, I asked him a few questions. Historically, there is reportedly 60-100 casualties on the Broomway. The main thing is the tide. It whips round from the North Sea and would come from, not as you expect, straight on from the horizon, but it'll often spiral in to the coastline, and so it'll cut you off from your pathway. It's very easy to get lost out on the Broomway, particularly in low-visibility conditions when it's raining or there's low fog, early morning, late at night. As there's no features or markers to take your bearing from, you can get very quickly disorientated. Quite often, people will naturally walk further out to sea, as opposed to back to land. The Broomway's only open at the weekends for the public. The MOD use this as an active firing range, and they have done since the late 1800s. And so, one thing that we might see out there is leftover ordnance. They do a pretty good job of cleaning up after themselves, but it doesn't mean that we won't see any out there. I've seen shells this big. You just have to really keep your distance. Shell craters are also a problem because of the exploded ordnance that has gone off, so it's essentially quick sand. And so, there'll be pockets of sand which are really soft and mushy that your feet will sink into that we have to be careful of. I only guide walks when the tide is constantly going out. So, we are three hours after high tide. The tide is still on its way out, and we should be coming back here as the tides are turning. So, obviously, we made it. Thank you, Tom! The path's called the Broomway because back before the military built that bridge, back when it was the only access onto this island, it was marked by ""brooms"" every 30 metres or so. Now, to 21st-century people, that implies broom handles sticking out the ground. But, no, I tracked down a photo from 1922, and the brooms were just short lumps of brush. But over the last century, those brooms stopped being maintained. They were either swept away or eroded, and now the path is unmarked. But it's still on the map. It's still a legal path. Permanently closing a right-of-way in Britain is difficult. On Foulness, there are public right-of-way footpaths that we can access. They are rarely used. And so, if you do take them, the security switchboards will light up because you'll get reported by MOD staff or by locals who live there because they think you're trespassing. I wouldn't be guiding this if I wasn't a qualified mountain leader who has map and compass skills, good experience of this guided walk that I do. I have first aid qualifications, so I know how to deal with and treat the likely emergencies that could happen out here. That article from 1922 also named some of the people who died on the path. Several doctors travelling to attend patients, young women trying to reach partners, and island residents who got careless, or who would sometimes stay in the mainland pubs too late and then try to race the tide back on a galloping horse. Because the part of the Broomway we walked isn't just a footpath. Under modern law, it is a ""byway open to all traffic"", which means that, in theory, you can take a horse or a tractor or anything that's road legal onto it. It would be a very, very bad idea to just drive onto the sands, but in theory you could, if you didn't get bogged down. Now, a few times a year, the village on the island and the main road are open for tourism, but not right now, not in 2020, which means that right now there is only one way for the average person to get onto Foulness Island. But there are two ways to leave. We could go off the rights of way, trespass onto military land, and then very soon after get escorted off by soldiers, assuming we weren't arrested. Or... we can just walk back. Ready when you are! Let's go! Thank you very much to Tom Bennett! He's a qualified mountain leader who runs tours across Britain. I'll put a link to his website in the description. It feels really weird talking about you in the third person when you're just there. [both laughing] Yeah. [water sloshing] Ugh!"
248,"If these pumps ever stop, part of Germany floods.","This is the Ruhr Valley in Germany. And it used to be a mining region. It used to produce huge amounts of anthracite, the sort of coal that you have to dig deep, deep tunnels to reach. Sometimes more than a kilometre down into the ground. But the last deep coal mine here closed at the end of 2018 as the world steadily shifts to renewables. But you can see the legacy of that mining in the landscape, in places like this. Strange hills which are old spoil tips. Dumping sites for everything that was dug up, that wasn't coal. All the earth and rock that was moved out of the way to create the mine shafts. They're steadily being reclaimed. Trees have been planted all over. And several of them now have art like this at the top. I visited one art piece called the Tetrahedron yesterday. The weather was bad and there was fog. And honestly it felt like I was on some sort of alien planet from a sci-fi show. The hill I'm standing on has an amphitheatre as well, although it's a little rundown now. It is very, very difficult to get across the sheer scale of these on camera, the incredible volume of earth and rock that was moved over decades. Don't get me wrong, the Ruhr Valley is still industrial. There are still opencast coal mines and factories producing all sorts of things. But it does seem like there's more and more talk about the legacy of industry here than actual industry itself. One old coal mine is now a museum and World Heritage Site. There's another strange legacy of the old coal mines here, though. If you take that much material out from under the surface and put it on top, the mass of it starts changing the landscape in a very different way. Parts of this valley sank unevenly, as far as 20 metres down in places. And that altered the way that rainwater drains. In that: it starts to drain towards where people live. So yesterday, I got to visit one of the pumping stations that puts the water back where it's supposed to be. The problem is that we have coal mining in this area since 1850. And because of this, the landscape has sunk down. And so we had to pump the whole River Boye up 18 metres to the river Emscher. And the river Emscher is flowing to the Rhine. In my operational area, we have about 60 pump stations, from a very small station with a few hundred litres, to this station with 40,000 litres per second. 83 square kilometres is our operational area, this one station. From my operational area, nearly 60% would be flooded if the whole pump stations wouldn't work. If you have dry conditions, it would be four to five days. In heavy rain conditions only five hours. The water will get out. Just to be clear, those pumps are moving a whole river, a small river, but a whole river, 18 metres up and through massive underground pipes. So the water can then join a bigger river that does eventually flow to the sea. There are around 180 pumping stations, large and small, across this valley. That one station is the largest. After a heavy storm, it will move up to 40,000 litres of water every second. If you look at articles about this, they'll sometimes mention groundwater and aquifers. But the engineers here told me that is wrong. It is probably a mistranslation. These are storm drains to deal with rainwater. The coal mining companies are paying for this because they had dug the coal. And because of this, the landscape has sunk down. So they have to pay for. When coal mining started here 150 years ago, no one thought about the land sinking. And when they did notice it, which was somewhere around 1900, it didn't stop the mining. They just built the first pumps. The coal was worth the money and the trouble then. But running the pumps is an eternal cost. Not technically eternal, I guess. But this won't go away in 100, or 1,000, or 10,000 years. Not until something equally dramatic and geological comes along to reshape the land. If people want to live in the Ruhr Valley, not the Ruhr Swamp or the Ruhr Lake, then the pumps must run."
249,The theme park inside an old nuclear power plant,"A few months ago, I went to Zwentendorf in Austria, which is a nuclear power plant that was built, and ready to go, and then cancelled. And it's now a training centre and accidental museum because, well, what else would you do with a never-used nuclear power plant? This is Wunderland Kalkar, it's a theme park opened in 2001. Each year, we get about 280,000 visitors here in the park. The Dutch entrepreneur Van der Most, he bought this in 1996. And from that time on, the first four or five years, we just put everything out of it and start to rebuild the whole area to what it is now. This was SNR-300, and its story is much the same as Zwentendorf's It was a nuclear power plant ready to go in Germany and then public protests and political problems meant that the whole project was postponed for a long, long while, and then Chernobyl happened in Ukraine and the tide of public opinion changed even further, and the whole project was just cancelled. The reactor itself, all the valuable stuff in there, well, that was sold off for parts and for scrap, but the land, well, that was sold off in the nineties. What we've got now is a theme park with approximately 40 attractions. Of course there's a carousel, there's the teacups the elephants, and there's also a very nice rollercoaster here in the park. One of the important things we've got is in the cooling tower, that's the Vertical Swing. We've got a hotel with a thousand beds, and we've got a big exhibition hall with 9,000 square metres where you can have all kinds of exhibitions. Two-thirds of the buildings at the moment are still empty. For example, the building behind us there was the reactor building. The reactor building, there's nothing in it at the moment, but we want to make a new landscape in it with all kinds of wellness area, but also a kind of winter landscape. This is just a small local theme park. You shouldn't expect hyper-coasters or anything with the polish of Disney, but they do have one unique ride. Not because of the ride itself, that's just an off-the-shelf Star Flyer, you can ride those a lot of places in the world, but not inside a cooling tower. And the view is spectacular. Oh, I should not have looked down. I should not have looked down. Thank you so much to everyone at Wunderland Kalkar. The season continues for a couple of weeks as this video goes live, and then they'll be open again next year."
250,"Swimming between two continents, debunked","""This is Silfra, in Iceland, where I got to swim between two continental plates. ""On one side of me is the North American plate. ""On the other side is the Eurasian plate. ""And here, this is where they're very slowly tearing apart."" Every word I said there was technically true. And I don't want this video to take away from the magic: swimming in Silfra was incredible, my guides were great, I'd recommend it. But here's the thing: this is the Bridge Between Continents, it's about 100km southwest of there, and it also claims to be the point where the two continental plates are breaking apart. And the two cracks, this and Silfra, they aren't connected. Not to each other, and not to the countless other cracks like them across Iceland. Now, the last time I did a video like this, a few people got angry at me. Because yes, I'm about to debunk something, and if you have fond memories of diving or snorkeling between continents, or holding up this bridge in a photo, this might make it a little less magical. Particularly if you we able to dive deep enough at Silfra to get the photo where you touch both sides at the same time. ""You need to be a qualified diver to head down into the depths. ""I'm not, so I'm staying up there on the surface with a snorkel. ""And yes, my camera lens keeps fogging up, ""I tried to do a piece to camera while I was in the water ""but it didn't go well."" [unintelligible wet microphone noises] Here's what true: Silfra is a crack in the earth, and it is between two tectonic plates. Absolutely. If you're diving there, you are 100% diving in between the continents. The bit that doesn't hold up is: that's not The Dividing Line. You've not got A Different Tectonic Plate on each side of you, you're just in the bit where they split apart. A good way of thinking about it is: imagine that this bridge really was between the continental plates. Imagine that really was the American plate, and this really was the Eurasian plate. What would this be, down below? I mean, other than a lot of volcanic sand that's getting in my shoes. Is it neither? Both? A bit in between? Whatever this is, it's true for this whole area, for kilometres. You can see that on the map in the bridge. This is just one of many places where the rocks happened to be a little bit weaker, so this is where they broke in two to let this whole area... stretch. Plate tectonics is messy and three-dimensional. This is just where it looks dramatic. As you move out of this area, east or west, over kilometres, the cracks become fewer and fewer, and less and less common, and then they stop, and then you can definitely say you're on one of the continental plates. But this bridge is symbolic. Silfra is symbolic. It's where one of the cracks happened to breach an underground river. But swimming in Silfra is still an incredible experience, and here's why. ""Silfra is filled with glacial meltwater, an underground river surfacing there, ""the water has been been filtered for decades through rock. ""And there's so much of it that there's a constant current ""pushing any impurities out into the nearby lake. ""Which includes me. ""I'm swimming in a literal river of mineral water, and the visibility is perfect. ""In other parts of Iceland, water like that is bottled and sold. ""But here, we're inside Ãingvellir National Park, ""which was the home of the Icelandic Parliament for eight centuries ""and is the most historic part of the entire country. ""So, no bottling plants there. ""And because it's glacial meltwater, ""it's also only just above freezing point, about 2-3Â°C, ""so I need to wear a dry suit to prevent hypothermia."" Swimming in Silfra is, technically, swimming between the continents. That is true. And if there's been one theme through my videos over the years, it's been that the real world does not fit into the neat little boxes that we'd like it to. Even though we keep designing systems that have strict categories and sharp dividing lines, there are always exceptions. The continents don't split at a single line. The real world is far more messy than we often think."
251,Is the most northern part of Iceland still there?,"The Arctic Circle is the line above which you get midnight sun at least one day a year. And also where you get one day where the sun doesn't peek above the horizon at all. But despite its reputation for being cold and northern, Iceland is not above the Arctic Circle. Well, most of it isn't. There is one part of a tiny island called GrÃ­msey, north of Akureyri, which is where I am now. GrÃ­msey is home to fewer than a hundred people and way more than a hundred puffins. And it's a good story. I was going to travel there, I was going to see the monument they built at the Arctic Circle line. But because the earth wobbles on its axis, the Arctic Circle is moving north. So there's now a new monument: an eight-tonne spherical stone boulder that they can move every year as the line moves. In about fifty years, they'll probably have to move it into the ocean, because the Arctic Circle will have left the island of GrÃ­msey for a few millennia. And Iceland, so my story went, will no longer have any territory above the Arctic Circle. Decent story, right? But then I found that there's another bit of Iceland above the Arctic Circle, another 60km or so further north. A small, uninhabitable bit of rock called Kolbeinsey. And that's the sort of technicality I have to pay attention to, if I don't want several hundred emails pointing out that I'm wrong. And so, the story about Grimsey sort of fell apart, it didn't work any more. Except, there's one line on the Wikipedia article about that small, uninhabitable bit of rock. ""It is subject to rapid wave erosion, ""and is expected to disappear in the near future, ""probably around the year 2020."" The trouble is, there's no way for a tourist to get out to Kolbeinsey. It's just a tiny bit of rock. To see if it's still there, you'd have to charter a plane. So I chartered a plane! We're flying out, right now, to the co-ordinates of where Kolbeinsey might be. Or might not be. Here's what I know: in the 17th century, Kolbeinsey was about 700m by 100m, and about 100m tall. It was the massive remnant of an old volcanic eruption. But it's been steadily, constantly eroded by the ocean, by freeze/thaw cycles, and by sea ice in winter. By 1986, it was only about 40m by 40m, and it only reached about 5m above the waves. Iceland built a helipad on there to try to stop it eroding, but in 2006 the Coast Guard here reported that the helipad had collapsed. Iceland isn't reinforcing Kolbeinsey any more: they seem to have abandoned it to the waves. And it might not seem like that matters. But tiny places like that can make a difference, because countries' territorial limits and exclusive fishing areas are sometimes decided by rocks like that. In the mid-20th century, the UK and Iceland had what the British media dramatically called the ""Cod Wars"", disputes about fishing rights near Iceland. And by the way, Iceland won. The UK conceded. Now, Kolbeinsey is mentioned in legal documents about Iceland's territorial limits, but I'm also not really sure whether it matters. To work out what's going to happen when it disappears, you'd need an expert in international maritime law and, frankly, a psychic, because the answer likely is: it gets settled by negotiations between governments, not by some rando in a plane going ""hey, your island isn't there any more!"" But it does feel a bit provocative for me, as a British person, to be checking up on whether Iceland's rock is still there. All right. We are approaching the co-ordinates. We are flying only 500 feet above the waves, that's about 150m. It's low tide. The weather is clear. If there was ever a chance to see if Kolbeinsey is still there, this is it. I think I can see it! I'm pretty sure that's it up ahead. Oh, man, there's barely anything. That used to be an island 700m by 100m, and that's all that's left. And yes, it's eroded away, but it looks like predictions were a little bit pessimistic. There's two little islands still poking above the water. Importantly, it is still there, at low tide it is still above the waves. Iceland, your island is still there. You're welcome! This video was inspired by some tweets from Sam Hughes, a brilliant science fiction author. I recommend his books Ra and Fine Structure, he's also responsible for the Antimemetics Division stories over on the SCP Wiki. I've linked to his work in the description. Sam, thank you very much."
252,The Abandoned Hill With Two Members Of Parliament,"This windswept hilltop is Old Sarum in Wiltshire. It's an enormous Iron Age hillfort and... you know what? Actually, the best way to see it is not from down here. This is one of the most important historical sites in Southern England. An Iron Age fortification from more than 2000 years ago. Then in the 11th century, a castle was built for William the Conqueror and the Catholic church built a cathedral here. You can see the foundations of all those surviving centuries later. This was a thriving bit of England. But it fell from grace. There's a lot of complicated reasons why, but one of the main ones is: a windswept hilltop is a terrible place for a cathedral. Much as that looks impressive and you can dominate a landscape that brings a number of problems with it. Supplies of water from wells were just not adequate to support a large population. Even to the extent that they actually needed to buy the water that they needed to drink. When the weather isn't good, the wind is blowing over, the rain is coming at you, when thunderstorms are going, it's a very, very bad place. As well as that, the local bishop, Roger, fell out with the new king Stephen, and that's in a period of history when ""falling out with the king"" was very serious indeed. Bishop Roger falls out with the king. He falls out with pretty much everyone. That is the price you pay for being active within politics and within religion and he plays the game at very high levels. And he does come crashing down. There's also an institutional problem. The king's men in the castle and the bishop's men around the cathedral, you get a few references to conflict there where, for example, a procession of clergy was stopped by some of the king's soldiers behaving churlishly. They would easily go, look, we don't want anymore of this. Begging the pope to release them from all of this, and the pope saying absolutely, you can have somewhere that will be all your own, down at the bottom. And giving them licence for it. So the clergy moved a couple of miles away to a new cathedral, in a place that would eventually become known as Salisbury. The buildings here started to fall into disrepair and the once-busy town declined and declined and declined. But despite that, for some reason, the landowners of Old Sarum were invited to send two representatives to Parliament. This was the 14th century, now, when the rules of Parliament were still being written. And the reason why they were invited is... a bit of a mystery. Historians still aren't sure. One of the things that modern archaeology is starting to tell us quite a bit about is whether there was stuff going on outside the hillfort on lower ground that we don't know about, that's nearer in to Old Sarum than the new city of Salisbury. There's a fairly strong likelihood that while the hillfort itself had been abandoned there was a bit more settlement further down. And probably in the later middle ages it wouldn't have been regarded as such a complete nonsense of two MPs being elected for a place with no population at all. So this hill had two members of Parliament. And that didn't change for centuries. It didn't change as the population dwindled, it didn't change when King Henry VIII signed over possession of all the buildings to a local official who ordered them dismantled and used for building material. By the 17th century, no one lived here. But you didn't have to live here to vote. Anyone who was nominated by the landowner as being one of the tenants in this area, that was enough. And of course they voted for the person who'd nominated them. So this hill became a rotten borough. If you owned the land, then you and a friend, or whichever two people you chose, had seats in Parliament. Representing basically just yourself. And if you were particularly rich and well connected you might own a couple of other boroughs nearby which would elect your friends. Meanwhile, places like the city of Manchester eventually growing to a quarter of a million people had no one representing them at all. For centuries. By the 19th century, it was clear that something had to be done, but how do you change something like that? How do you convince people with power to give up that power? Public outrage. Radicals. Protests, including one where 60,000 people were attacked by the military which came to be known as the Peterloo Massacre. In May 1832, riots broke out when the third attempt at a reform bill was blocked in Parliament. And Britain likely came close to revolution. After all, the French Revolution was still very much in, uh, living memory then. In short, the reformers won. And historians can argue about how much of that was political wrangling by the people who gained power, and how much of that was the very real threat of violent revolution. When the dust settled, the law was changed, the rotten boroughs were abolished, and there were 130 new seats in Parliament. Voting was still only for men with land or money though. It took until 1918 for that to become ""all men and some women"", and it was 1928 before it was ""all adults"". These days parliamentary boundaries are drawn by an independent group based on population. This hill is managed by a charity called English Heritage, and one Member of Parliament for Salisbury represents this whole area and the roughly 70,000 people who live in it. It's important to remember that history is fractal. You could spend days or years or a lifetime studying everything that happened over those few days in 1832. Or you could sum up centuries in a few minutes. But there's one thing that Old Sarum shows very clearly, it is extremely difficult to convince people with power to give it up willingly. Thanks to English Heritage for letting me film at Old Sarum, you can find out more about them and about visiting here on their website. The link is in the description."
253,The first internet bench probably wasn't,"In August 2001, the press descended on the town of Bury St Edmunds in south-east England. The mayor was going to unveil the world's first Internet Bench here in the Abbey Gardens. I'm not sitting on the bench for a couple of reasons. One, I can't get close-ups of it while I'm sitting on it, and two, it looks like quite a lot of the local bird life has been perched above it recently. Anyway, ""internet bench"" sounds ridiculous, but you have to remember in 2001, there were no smartphones. Wifi did technically exist, but it wasn't widespread. And mobile internet was limited to a few specially coded, tiny black and white sites, which could be accessed slowly and expensively on just a few models of phone. If you wanted an internet connection in 2001, your computer had to be plugged in somehow, you couldn't just expect to check your email in a park, and thus: the Internet Bench. A bench with sockets you could plug your computer's modem into, and dial up to the internet over a phone line. Which is weird, right? 'Cause surely the sensible thing to do, even back then, would've been to have one internet connection, maybe an ADSL line, and then share it like a regular corporate network, just plug in an ethernet cable and you'd have a connection. But no, you had to use a phone cable, and your laptop would have to dial a regular landline phone number to connect to... well. Who? Launch day photos make it very clear who you were supposed to connect to, or at least it would, if the mayor had realised which way up stickers need to be on a laptop. This was all a publicity stunt for MSN, the Microsoft Network. And there are some very nice quotes from MSN staff in the BBC article about it, which were probably pasted straight from the press release. In truth, this wasn't really an internet bench, it was a bench with a couple of phone extensions run to it, and that was it. For a three-month trial period, you could dial up to your own internet account from here, and it didn't take long before some local tech-savvy teenagers worked out there wasn't any block on the numbers you could call from here. The bench just had a few phone sockets wired into the exchange at Microsoft's expense. So, of course, they made a couple of international calls for free and tried to get through to Bill Gates. They didn't manage it, but they did get a nice write-up in the local paper. And one of the most wonderful early-2000s posed photos I have ever seen. From a technical standpoint, this bench was a disaster, but MSN were probably happy with it. They'd have been happy with the teenage hackers, as well. It got their company name in the paper again. They're probably still happy with this video, even as I tell you it was a terrible half-assed idea. Because what it did, and what it's still doing, was get their name and logo in front of an audience. They just want to be noticed. That's one of the dirty secrets of public relations. If you want to get the attention of the press, if you want your brand in front of the world, you don't have to actually make something good, or useful, or sensible, or that even works like you said it would. The truth is malleable. You just have to tell a story that resonates, get the press in to take some pictures, and figure they don't know enough about the subject to ask technical questions. And then after you've got those column inches, or these days, the retweets and clicks, you can basically abandon the whole project. The public are fine with it. It's a silly story that doesn't matter. The press are fine with it. They've got content and sold the adverts around it, and it doesn't matter if it gets ripped apart later, as long as it doesn't kill or maim anyone, then you got your free advertising. And we've seen this time after time after time. Heck, I've done this occasionally in the past. That's not even the same bench, actually. It's the right location, but it's been swapped out for a different one with a couple of plaques on it and no phone sockets. But then, the bench working was never the point. This wasn't about connecting the town of Bury St Edmunds or blazing a trail into the future, it was about getting cheap advertising. And here I am, 20 years later, still giving them that, because World's First Internet Bench still gets attention. Oh, someone sat in it."
254,This billion-euro nuclear reactor was never switched on,"Just over 50 years ago, the Austrian government decided to build three nuclear reactors along the Danube River. It was the age of the atom, the height of the space race. Nuclear power seemed like the natural next step for Austria. But politically, it was risky, and the decision was extremely controversial. It took many years of arguments and protests. But eventually, the country held a referendum. The government asked the people of Austria: ""do you want nuclear power?"" And the vote was on a knife-edge. When everything was counted, 50.5% said... ""No"". The trouble was, they'd already built the first reactor, they just hadn't turned it on yet. This nuclear power plant was built up from 1972 to 1976. Everything was here. The power plant was ready for operation, including the fuel rods. They only have to push the red button to put it into operation. And then, the chancellor of Austria decided to hold a public referendum. We like to say this special nuclear power plant never splits any atoms, but people, families and political parties. The capacity of the nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf was 750 megawatts. This reactor should have produced electricity for 1.8 million households. So what do you do with a never-used nuclear power plant? It's not like you can just flat-pack it and ship it over the border to somewhere that does want it. And this was incredibly expensive. Adjusting for inflation, in today's money, this plant cost over a billion euro. When the result of the public referendum was mentioned on the national TV stations, for 200 people here in Zwentendorf it was a shock. Nobody estimated this result. The owners, they decided to conservate the reactor because they thought that politicians will change their mind and they are able to put the reactor into operation in one, or two, or three years. But that never happened. So in 1985, they started to sell parts of the equipment. But this selling process was not very successful, and today we have 99% of the equipment still here. EVN bought the nuclear power plant in 2005. We don't have plans now to use it. But if there's some day the need for a gas-fired power plant or an alternative-fired power plant, for example with biomass, it's a perfect location. In the meantime, it's a training centre for nuclear engineers for training how you can rebuild a reactor. We offer it as a filming location. We use it for music festivals, 15,000 people outside and inside. We installed, in 2009, a solar power plant. And since 2010, we offer guided tours. It's open to the public. You can book your reservation, but normally we are full for six months within some minutes. EVN bought not only a technical building, we bought also a very specific piece of Austria's contemporary history. Here, everything is like it was more than 40 years ago. I love the special atmosphere you have here, and I'm really glad to present it to other people. After the referendum, Austria went on to entirely ban nuclear power within its borders, maybe because the residents had concerns about accidents, or maybe because they didn't want to deal with the waste and long-term planning, or maybe, if you believe conspiracy theories, because some of the people who ran energy companies back then were worried about prices dropping and threw a load of money at a scare campaign. The story changes a lot depending on who's telling it. And it is the politically easy option to phase out nuclear power. Particularly now as wind and solar continue to become more and more viable, a lot of countries are phasing out nuclear. I shouldn't be able to stand here. This reactor should've run for about 35 years, and now it'll be almost finished being decommissioned. There'd be hardly anything left. Instead, we got a training centre, a filming location, and, yeah, a very expensive occasional tourist attraction. But perhaps most importantly, we got a museum. Because this reactor doesn't have to be decommissioned. It's the only one on the planet where this 1970s dream of the atomic age can be preserved, if only by accident. Many, many thanks to Stefan Zach and all the team at EVN who gave us so much access to this incredible place. You can find out more about them at the link in the description."
255,The country where all public transit is free,"Luxembourg is a small country. It's about 50 miles by 35 miles, with just over 600,000 people living in it. And here in the capital, Luxembourg City, around 200,000 people commute into work every day, half from outside the country, but less than 20% of them travel by public transit. But from Sunday, March 1st, all public transit in the entire country will be free. Pretty soon, there'll be no ticket machines, unless you want an international ticket. There'll be no fare dodgers, unless you count people who are sneaking into the first-class train cabins that you will still have to pay for. And on the face of it, free public transit seems like an easy decision. Get people out of cars and into buses and trains. But it's a little more complicated than that. We are the country, besides Qatar, with the highest degree of cars per household, in Luxembourg, and we have definitely a big problem, especially in peak hours, with enormous congestion problems. We have a problem also that quality-of-life in our cities, in our villages, it's really worsened. That comes because Luxembourg is a country where you had not only the highest average of economic growth in the last 25 years, but also our population growth is the highest in the European Union. Having mobility behaviour that is mainly based on individual cars cannot really function anymore, and at the end, it's also a problem then for our economy itself. Making public transit free is not a new idea. There are quite a few cities around the world who've already done it, and a lot of Estonia now has free public transit for residents. Luxembourg, though, is the first country to abolish fares entirely, and partly that's because it can afford to do it. The country is a small, rich tax haven. The thing is, public transit here is almost free already. A ticket valid for a full day on every bus, tram, and train in the country is â¬4. The whole transit network costs the government â¬700 million a year to operate, but all the tickets sold add up to just 10% of that. By comparison, London's transit network is about half-funded by fares. So from the Luxembourg government's perspective, there's not actually that much difference between a â¬4 day ticket and free transit, but ""free transit"" is the sort of headline that gets you a lot of good publicity. But hey, if transit is free, why would you want to get around by car? Well, it's because the transit here isn't great. It's okay, by European standards. The buses and trains will get you there. I've had no problems as a tourist, but the commuter lines are already overcrowded in rush hour. A lot of the rolling stock is dated, and there is a litany of complaints about the paths they take and how they deal with breakdowns. Driving here, even with the congestion, is usually quicker and more convenient, sometimes even for journeys directly between city centres. So every year, there's more and more people moving here, and the infrastructure system is under a lot of strain. So the needs are to make it work, not to make it free. There's lots of research on this, and what comes out over and over again is that the fare is not the main motivating factor. The main motivating factor is comfort, reliability, and safety. No one ever knows if the trains are actually going to be on time. It has happened that people are standing for an hour and a half on the platform waiting for the train, with no substitute buses or anything. So that's an extreme case, obviously, but if one wants to be somewhere on time, one has to take this into account, that these things do happen. The cities who are doing this investment into public transport, into free public transport, that's really the bit of cities that, from a competitive point of view, will be, in the world, the winning cities. Even if I say it's free to use, somebody pays it. So at the end, the 700 million euros will be paid by the taxpayers in general. Someone, for example, with minimum income pays no taxes. So he has the public transport, really, for free, but somebody who pays high taxes, he pays much more. That's an important point: for someone like me, who's a tourist with a travel budget, â¬4 for a day pass isn't a big issue, but for someone on minimum wage who has to commute an hour, or two hours from wherever housing's affordable, that makes a big difference. I don't think the key social issue in Luxembourg is the price of the transit. One needs to look at the housing costs. The increasing prices of housing are pushing people to the border regions. So it might be financially more sound to live in Belgium, or France and Germany, buy a house, or rent a house, and buy a couple of cars, than it would be to live here in Luxembourg and use the transit. It needs investment, and it needs investment now. It's behind. And so Luxembourg needs to catch up and plan for the future. You must see the free public transport additionally to the investments that we are doing in the improvement of the network and the quality of the public transport. If you only introduce free public transport, that will change not very much behaviour. It can only function if you do it combined with a complete strategy that will switch from individual mobility to multi-modality, so even including pedestrians, cyclists, and if you invest at the same time, a lot of money, in the infrastructure of public transport, so that at the end, you can combine everything. We say, if we built an infrastructure, we will build it to move people and not to move cars. I'm not saying free transit is a bad thing. I think it's a great idea, personally, but having good, frequent, well-connected transit that isn't too crowded to board is also important. The question isn't as binary as ""Should public transit be free?"" because in a utopia, of course it would be. It would also be autonomous, zero-emission, and it would run from anywhere to everywhere all the time. But until we're in a post-scarcity society, the public are paying one way or another, either through taxes or fares. The more important question is about planning and long-term investment, because if your bus is always late, and your train's always cancelled, it doesn't matter if they're free."
256,The Dutch headwind cycling championships are amazing,"I'm standing on the Oosterscheldekering, the largest part of the Dutch Delta Works. It is a megastructure. An enormous dam, nine kilometres long with four kilometres of sluice gates that can be closed to hold back extreme high tides and stop the Netherlands flooding. It took a decade to build and it is a rallying cry of human planning, survival and achievement. And it is not what I'm here to talk about. There days ago, a forecast came in. A storm is going to hit, winds will gust up 120 km/h on this barrier. And so a different rallying cry went up. Three words: ""We kriehen sturm"". A storm is coming. Because today is NK Tegenwindfietsen, The Dutch headwind cycling championships. Several hundred Dutch people looked at this weather and said, ""We're going to have a bike race in that"". The course is eight and a half brutal kilometres. It's a serious event, with permissions and everything. We have a limit of 300 participants. All the bikes are the same. No gears, and just an ordinary brake. And it's a typical dutch bike. Have you done it? Yes, two times. How difficult is it? Very. I do triathlon in my spare time and it's just as hard. At high speed, up to 90% of the drag on a cyclist is from air resistance. And I naively assumed, because it's been 15 years since I've studied high school physics, that it'd be an equal action-reaction thing. Double the wind speed, double the drag. But that's only true when there's no turbulence. In a situation like this, the drag increases with the square of wind speed. Double the wind speed, quadruple the drag force. The difference between cycling in a 15 km/h headwind and a 120 km/h gust is 64 times the added drag. Why are you doing this? I don't know. [laughs] I really don't know. Do you regularly do bike races and things like this? No, just bike for fun. How do you think it's going to be? Hard! Very hard! Succes! Dank je wel! And sure, it's a good, weird human interest story, right? People are doing a deliberately difficult thing and hurting themselves just enough that it's interesting. But this is a good place for it. Because not only are humans literally pushing against the storm and saying, ""we can beat you"", they are on a physical monument to doing just that. There's a big rock in the middle of the barrier, with an inscription that translates as ""Here the tide is ruled by the wind, the moon and us""."
257,The bridge that's in two countries at the same time,"Right, this is going to be a slightly more improvised video than normal, for two reasons. Er, one, it is really cold here and I want to move on, but also because I didnât know I was going to be passing through Schengen, a little town in Luxembourg on the borders with France and Germany, until today. But here I am, next to the international border, the Moselle River, and that border is a little bit weird. And I wasnât going to do another video about a weird border. Because Iâve done that. Years ago I went to the towns of Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog in Belgium and the Netherlands, where the borders are incredibly complicated and twisted thanks to history. But thatâs an old video that Iâm not really proud of, and frankly itâs not that interesting: I only managed about a minute of script before I had to go into a diversion on sovereignty and why we even have borders in the first place. Strange borders often make for great video titles, but thereâs not much to talk about other than âhuh, thatâs weirdâ. Which is also why Iâve never been to the island that changes country every six months between France and Spain. Because once youâre there, what is there to say but, âhuh, thatâs weirdâ. But it turns out this border raises a different question. If you look on the map, there is a tripoint just of there, to the west of an island: thatâs where France, Germany and Luxembourg all meet. It was here â actually, on a boat out at that tripoint, where the Schengen agreement was signed, where most of the countries of the EU, all the ones that have their flags here, decided to open their internal borders. But that the tripoint there is not strictly true. The border between Germany and Luxembourg doesnât follow the Moselle river: the border is the Moselle river. And thatâs an important distinction. In most cases, international borders that follow rivers are defined as following the centre line, which raises questions in itself, because rivers can erode the banks and change paths sometimes, but borders are, at least, usually defined as a line of theoretically zero width. Which is how mapmakers mark it. But here, Germany and Luxembourg share the river north of France. It is a ""condominium"". Under the treaties they signed, they both have full control over it. Which means that if youâre standing on the north tip of that island, or on that bridge up there, you are in both countries at the same time. Not just in terms of having a foot on each side, although that may well be how the locals treat it, and thatâs certainly how the signs mark it. But no: standing on that bridge above the water, all of you is in both countries simultaneously. This international border is a shape, not a line. Itâs two-dimensional. Although, actually, I guess itâs three-dimensional if you count depth. Half an hour of research, and I canât tell you why they made that decision, or what the legal result would be if you tried to commit a crime on that bridge or on a boat on the river. I even asked the folks at the little European museum just over there, and they didnât know the answer. Although they do have a lovely little display of all the border guard hats that the Schengen agreement made obsolete. I suspect that the answer would be âtreat it as if itâs a line, itâs easierâ. And thatâs what I mean when I say that thereâs not much to talk about here. Because thatâs one of the wonderful things about borders like this: when you can walk between three countries as easily as you can walk between counties or towns or neighbourhoods: itâs a lot easier to say âhuh, thatâs weirdâ and just get on with your life."
258,The world's littlest skyscraper was a massive scam,"All right, is that focused? Think so, hope so. Good, I haven't got long. It is the end of the day, I'm losing the light. I've got to drive on and then catch a flight soon. So I'm going to tell you a story, but I have not been able to work out how much of it is true. And that's okay, and I'll tell you why that's okay, but it does put me in a bit of a difficult position because everyone that I've met here in Wichita Falls, Texas, has been lovely. And this is a great story that sends tourists to their town. So, with that said, this is the Newby-McMahon Building, the World's Littlest Skyscraper. It's not much of a skyscraper, it's only four stories tall, and its footprint is so small that it is barely usable as a building. Now the legend goes that back when Wichita Falls was an oil boom town, 1918, there was a massive construction rush. Investors were pouring money into new downtown buildings, confident that the town would be prime real estate for decades to come. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The boom was followed by a bust and by the Great Depression. But this building caused its investors more trouble than most. It cost $200,000, which is about $3 million in today's money and the investors thought that it was going to be 12 times as tall because the blueprints they thought were marked in feet were actually in inches. No one noticed the little extra mark next to the numbers on the plans. So the new downtown skyscraper turned out to be only four stories tall and not 48, and so narrow it was almost unusable. The developer, J.D. McMahon, ran off with most of the money, all that was left over from only having to construct a tiny building, and a local judge ruled that the blueprints were accurate. The investors had got exactly what they'd signed off on, exactly what they paid for. The building sat abandoned for a long time and it was renovated in the early 21st century and these days, it's a furniture boutique and I talked to the owner. When we first took over this building with our shop, this skyscraper was never allowed to be entered by the public and we wanted to open it up. The engineers had to come to make sure the floors could sustain constant occupancy and in fact, they did have to give us some weight and load limits and they did have to put in an additional structural beam. Whenever you have a multi-story building, by City code, there must be an egress and entrance. So, they had said, well, we must have at least two staircases to allow for that. Well, if this building had two sets of stairs, it would literally be a building full of two sets of stairs and there would be no defined space whatsoever. So, I think, as the compromise from our City, we do have a state-of-the-art fire suppression system. The fire marshal that comes to inspect it periodically tells me that if we do ever catch on fire, we will not have to worry about burning, but we might have to worry about drowning. In the early '30s, this was engulfed in flames and so the floors were gone, the roof was gone and it got boarded up and it stood that way for decades. We do have some old newspaper accounts and some old documentation of people that were interviewed back then, how they wanted the building to be demolished immediately because it was a scandal. You know, these people had been ripped off and they were embarrassed about being duped like this. However, it wasn't demolished because they really needed it for office space so it was used. So we do have some documentation like that, but the original plans that allegedly he had given to his investors, they don't exist, as far as I know. It's a great story. So I started to fact-check it and I came up blank. Here's what I did before getting here. I tracked down every article I could on every database I could access, but they were all too modern and the chain of references ran out, usually somewhere in the '80s. There are references to a ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" panel from the 1920s, but I emailed the archivists at Ripley's and they said their archives are incomplete. They don't have a copy of it. No one has a copy of it. And look, if we're honest, ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" is not a reliable primary source. So, when I got here, I went to the Wichita Falls Library over there, thank you so much to all the librarians who helped, and I looked through the local newspaper from 1919. It's not been digitised so I had to hunt through microfilm and scan headlines and in the time I had here, I couldn't find a mention of the building or of the lawsuit at all. I did find an article about the changing skyline. It has no mention of a planned 48-story building. So, it feels like the real estate scandal, the lawsuit after, should have been all over the news when it came out, surely, but maybe I missed it. Maybe it was too small an article. In boom times it might have been, or maybe I wasn't looking at the right dates. And look, this is a ridiculous building. On camera, it almost looks sensible but standing here, it is very easy to agree that this building, must have been a scam of some sort. So, if I was to place a bet, I would say that the scam part is likely, that someone came along in the middle of boom times, sold a dodgy building to gullible investors and ran off with the proceeds, is very, very plausible. The inches instead of feet detail of the story, though, I just don't know. Surely the investors would have noticed that their giant skyscraper only had four floors and a couple of windows. Surely they'd have questioned the plans, so maybe that was a joke from the townsfolk a century ago that got reported as fact. Or maybe the investors were off in another state and never got a close look at the blueprints. Or maybe it's true and they were taken in by a smooth-talking scammer. There is a plausible answer for every skeptic's question about this and I am not saying that the story is false, just that I can't find primary sources. I can't find anything from the time that is evidence for it or against it. And if you can, don't tell me. Write an article, post somewhere authoritative, take a picture of the old newspaper and tweet it out, update Wikipedia. I've reached the end of what I can do. But that's fine, and here's why it's fine. Because this is folklore. This is a trickster story. This is the same thing that appears in mythology from across the world and across time. If you think you've heard something like this before, you have. There are a lot of stories like it. It's the monorail episode of ""The Simpsons."" All those news outlets and blogs repeating and emphasizing the tale. That's our modern oral tradition. That's passing on stories, person to person to person. In a world where making up complete lies to get ad revenue is a viable business model, this is kind of charming. It's a story. And as long as those articles say, ""according to legend"", or ""the tale goes that"", then I think that's fine. We're human, we see things as part of a narrative. Margaret Atwood wrote: ""in the end, we'll all become stories"", and yeah, this is a really good story. All right, hope that worked, 'cause I've got about... not enough time to get to Dallas. All right, let's go."
259,The world's only wingsuit tunnel,"I got an email from the world champion wingsuit team that said, ""Would you like to learn to fly in the world's only diagonal wind tunnel?"" I've got to start saying no to these things. My name is Jarno Cordia. As part of the Wingsuit Tunnel here I've actually been setting up the coaching here the last two years. And together now with Jenna, I teach here and try to get everybody flying. Currently Jenna and myself, we won the last World Cup in Italy in both indoor skydiving and outdoor skydiving. We're at the moment the reigning team in wingsuit acrobatics. This wind tunnel was around since 1935. Used for testing aeroplanes , cars and those kind of things. I think they tested the Saab aeroplane and the Huygens space capsule here. This tunnel was up for auction a few years ago and then four of the local Swedish guys, who are also skydivers, they basically thought, what if we can convert this into an angled wind tunnel where you can actually fly wingsuits. And because that hadn't been done yet, nobody really knew if such a thing would be possible. So, they basically took the horizontal wind tunnel here. They put a small angled tube in it. Once they had done the initial testing, I was called in to actually see, besides stable flying, what else can we do in the tunnel. When that was all a big success, they raised the money and actually built this amazing machine. Now it's essentially an angled tube that is on a pivot point and that can actually rotate the tunnel up and down with a piston. I would say in terms of physical workout for a beginner, it's insanely heavy. And that is mainly because, in the beginning, you are not flying super efficient. So you're using a lot of muscle tension. You're tending to bend the arm which creates a round wing that really creates drag on your body. In the beginning, maybe 40 minutes a day is the max and then people really feel like they ran three marathons. I currently have the world record, which is definitely the most boring thing I ever did, but somehow the most watched thing, and it's flying six and a half hours non-stop in the tunnel without touching the floor, walls or anything. I can't think right now. Ah. The last 10 seconds, you were giving me instructions but my brain just wasn't parsing anything. What we start with is this cable system where essentially you're on two pulleys that are on the ceiling that allow you to move around, but they don't allow you to actually get close to the walls. The cables definitely influence you a little bit as well with like the bounciness of cables, but it essentially limits the motion to safely learn to just control your body. Kind of like an aeroplane. Like you lean a bit left, the wing goes left. You raise the chin and the chest gets air. That changes your angle, pushes you backward. With those kind of motions, you need to really learn to fly. And even for skydivers that have a lot of wingsuit experience, they tend to fly more by instinct and even for them, this is a lot more precise than what you normally do outdoors. So am I too far back or too far forward? Too far forward. From that point where you can actually control yourself on the cables, there you can continue to flying without the cables. There's a small, intermediate step we do, which is flying with a leash on the belly Which allows us to let people fly free but in case they do anything less smart, we can still put them on the floor. The difference between flying in the tunnel and flying in the air is definitely the lack of space. So in the air, if you're learning to fly and you're essentially all over the place, that is not an issue. In the tunnel if you're all over the place, you can be all over the place for about two metres and then the wall stops you. Another thing that is definitely different is your reflexes that you have from the ground. Like if you're flying on your back and you're falling backwards, we tend to put our butt down to cushion our fall, which of course in the sky, you would never do. And definitely the walls and the floor, they introduce these reflexes that we've trained over the years to put your arms in front of you or to the sides that in flying don't have the best effect. A big thing that the tunnel brings that skydiving doesn't get you is the amount of training you can do and the reference you get where normally in the sky, if I'm flying with a training partner, when we're having a little bit of movement between each other, we don't see who is making the movement. In the tunnel, because you have a static reference, you see every little move so you learn so much faster because this gives you so much more feedback in terms of what you're doing. Once they showed that they can fly well with the belly leash, that comes off as well and then you're flying fully free. And then from there it's quite a rapid progression to learn to fly on your back and then actually learn to do the transitions, carving around the tunnel. Typically that whole progression takes around two to three hours of flying for most people. in general, it's quite cool to see that where normally people would have 200-300 skydives before they could even try this, now we're taking people off the street and teaching them to fly in one or two days. I did not get to the point where, like, I could just fly free in the tunnel, but there was four or five seconds in there where I felt stable. And I don't think you were pulling on me? No, no no. Thank you. -You're more than welcome! Super good, man. Thank you very much. I'm done! The amount of flying you did now is what the super trained people usually do after building that stamina. So you flew more than most people do on the first day in a very short time span so all the muscles you're feeling that you've never used before, that's quite normal. Yeah! But you did really good. And you're going to sleep really well tonight. Yeah! Yeah I am! Should we just turn off the lights here and leave you here? No, because then it's a slow slide down into that! All right we're good. We got an outro.` Thank you so much. All right, yeah. We're good."
260,The giant art that keeps planes quiet,"Hearing is incredible. Think about it: a tiny little bit of tissue in your ear, a tenth of a millimetre thick, moves in response to changes in air pressure, and converts them into tiny vibrations in fluid, and then those get converted into electrochemical impulses that go the brain, where they are somehow decoded into what you experience as sound. And if all of that is working properly, then you're able to pick out one source of sound from another, in 3D space, and your brain is optimised to pick out words and language even through huge amounts of noise. It'll even filter out constant, steady noise like a fan or the wind whistling through trees. To give an idea of just how difficult a task that is: this is the waveform of the sound that's on this video. Same information, just presented differently, but it's not something that you can make sense of with your eyes. And it's not like your eardrum only resonates at a few frequencies. Human hearing in a healthy, young person runs from somewhere up around 20,000 cycles a second, all the way down to 20. Which means the eardrum can pick up air movements with wavelengths that range from a couple of centimetres for high frequencies, to 10 or 20 metres for really low bass. The sort of low, rumbling bass that you would get from, say, a jet engine. Just over there is Amsterdam Schiphol airport. In terms of aircraft flying in and out, it's the busiest airport in Europe. Six runways. Two control towers, one just for the new runway that's over there that opened in 2003. That runway is five kilometres away from the terminal. If you look at aerial photos, you can see plane after plane after plane lined up on a fifteen-minute taxi, including going on a bridge across a road and a canal. It was raining when my plane landed, but I just about got that shot out the window. But there was one residential area, just back there, where there was nothing but flat ground between those houses and the back end of jet engines. I mean, of course it was flat ground, it's the Netherlands, but there was one spot just back there where it got significantly louder for the people who lived there. And those local residents were not happy. Of course, the one day I'm here, they're actually landing on that runway, not taking off so the engines are pointed the other way, but the point still stands. The local residents were not happy. This is the solution. Well, not a solution,  at least something to help. This is a park that serves two purposes: one, to be land art, the sort of high-concept big sculpture that's created by moving enormous amounts of earth and rock. This was designed by an artist. I mean, I'd send up a drone to show you, but, you know, airport. But the second purpose is sound dampening. These ridges are metres apart, roughly, very roughly, around the same wavelength as the low rumble you get from a jet engine. Not exact, of course, but in the same order of magnitude, close enough to be disruptive. So rather than the sound waves just rolling over the land, instead they're scattered in all directions, up and away, not onwards. Not perfectly, not even close, but enough to bring the noise level at those houses back down within acceptable limits. The architects claim that one of the inspirations for this was people noticing that the engine noise sounded quieter when the fields were ploughed. Because, yes, your brain can filter out constant, steady noise. It can even, over time, get used to filtering out intermittent, loud noise, like living next to an airport. But that filtering job is a lot easier if the noise would just be a little less loud."
261,"These tunnels are designed for 100,000 years","There's an urban legend that when grave-robbers found their way to ancient Egyptian tombs, there were warnings they ignored. ""Do not open this tomb. ""Do not steal the riches inside. ""You will be cursed and you will die."" It's not true. Not just the curses aren't real, but those warnings were just an urban legend. The robbers wouldn't have been able to read them. And even if they could, the messages weren't warning of curses. They were just the ancient equivalent of a 'no trespassing' sign. This is Olkiluoto, an island on the far west of Finland. And here, they're building a tomb for something that really is dangerous. In a few years, the deep bedrock here will contain the world's first long-term storage site for high-level nuclear waste, right next to some of the reactors that produce it. This isn't a video about whether nuclear power is good or bad. I think it's good, and so, it seems, does Finland. The third reactor here is being tested now and it's due to go online next year. But this video is about a different question. We do have nuclear power in the world, so where do we put the waste? I didn't know how it would feel until I stood here. It is very strange to have 400 metres of rock above my head and knowing that inside that solid plug of clay there there is high-level radioactive waste. This new tunnel complex is called Onkalo, which translates as 'cavity'. And long-term storage really does mean long-term: 100,000 years. To put that in perspective, 100,000 years ago, humans hadn't made it to Europe yet; the continent was still frozen in the middle of an ice age. Our species were just hunter-gatherers. This facility is being designed to last for geological time. And yes, despite the fact that there are hundreds of nuclear reactors in the world, right now there is no permanent geologic storage facility anywhere for high-level radioactive waste, the spent nuclear fuel, the really nasty stuff that could cause disasters if it leaks. Now, the problem isn't urgent. The world doesn't actually produce that much of it, relatively speaking. A century's worth of high-level waste from all the current reactors in Finland will fit in the final version of this one new facility. But right now, around the world, high-level radioactive waste is generally stored near reactors, first in water ponds that require active cooling, and then in concrete casks that'll last, well, about as long as a concrete building would; not long enough. The US has been trying to work out a storage site for years, but their one serious attempt, Yucca Mountain, has been mired in politics for decades. Finland, here, is closest to building that solution. The geology in Finland is very old. We are talking about two thousand million years is the age of what we have below our feet here. And in that way, it's really stable and it represents the most ancient parts of this Earth. High-level waste will be disposed of with cast-iron copper canisters, and the canisters are put into the hole in the deposition tunnels and then these are surrounded by bentonite clay. Clay has a low hydraulic conductivity, which means that the water doesn't transport through the clay. The spent fuel, when it's taken from the reactors into the disposal, it's highly radioactive. But with time, the radioactivity will decrease. After 500 years, people can stand beside the canister and it's not dangerous. But there are some other long-lived radionuclides which might be harmful in case they were to come up to the surface and into the drinking water, into the wells or biosphere, and therefore the geological disposal will isolate the waste for 100,000 years. This area isn't prone to earthquakes or other natural disasters. Geologically, it's about as peaceful as you can get. So, the plan is: dig the tunnels and then, for 100 years, put the casks of waste in, and then backfill each tunnel with clay so they're encased in solid rock. And once the site is full, fill in every bit of it, every last tunnel, and then leave it forever. There are multiple levels of containment. The idea is that even if one or two of them fail, everything will still be safe for 100,000 years, unless someone digs it up. When the US government was thinking about using Yucca Mountain as its storage site, they commissioned a now-famous report on how to mark a site like this. How do you warn people away, even if our civilization has collapsed, our language has fallen apart, and no one knows what radiation is? There were all sorts of ideas, from a spike field to 'forbidding blocks'. But all those would ultimately be a big sign saying, ""Hey, there's something interesting under here; dig!"" The facilities will be closed in about 100 years, 6,500 tonnes of uranium. We have not decided what is the best way to mark that. There was one other idea in that research paper: Don't mark the site at all. One the repository is full, fill it in, seal it shut, and then hide it so there's nothing remarkable at the surface. There are very few reasons to dig this deep, particularly here. The odds are slim that some future archaeologist would deside to dig 400 metres down in this remote location. And if they did, if someone ignored all the warnings or arrived after everything had been eroded away up top, well, if they did break through all the containment in search of treasure, what they'd get is radiation poisoning and a particularly unpleasant death. If the grave-robbers that dug up Egyptian tombs had started rapidly and obviously dying from a real curse, maybe they would've taken the hint. Thank you so much to all the team at Olkiluoto who showed me and all the camera teams who are down here today around. You can find out more about them in the links in the video description. All right, thank you. Your turn!"
262,The toxic pit with a $3 admission fee,"35,000 tourists a year visit the Berkeley Pit. A century ago this was called the Richest Hill on Earth. It was the Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, Montana. It's not rich anymore, and it's not much of a hill. In the 1950s, the mine changed from digging underground tunnels that followed particularly rich veins of copper, to just excavating everything, turning the hill into an open pit on a scale that is difficult to convey on camera. There were whole neighbourhoods destroyed to make way for this. It is a mile wide, and so deep that you could fit the new One World Trade Center standing upright in it. Or at least you could, if the pit wasn't halfway filled with toxic dilute acid. It kills any birds that land in there for too long. In 2016, thousands of geese died in one night after a snowstorm forced them down there. The team here let me get a little bit closer than the tourists do. Some studies were done to try to figure out how long a bird can withstand sitting on the pit water and those studies found that it's up to 18 hours. Six to seven thousand birds come through and utilise the Berkeley Pit as a resting stop per year. We're on the overlap of two major flyways so it's to be expected. [deep boom] Can you tell me what that was? So that's a propane cannon, we have them on timers and they run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Hopefully, deter the birds from ever considering landing on the water of the Berkeley Pit to begin with. If the birds land, we have a crew of personnel that observes from this shack on the hour. They log them and then attempt to haze them off. The go-to is high-powered rifles, you have that ability to hit very close to the birds from a very far distance away. And it's not so much the boom as you would expect that scares them but it's the projectile hitting the water, creating a large splash, and that's what usually does it. And in the case that we know a large flock of birds is coming, we can have continual fireworks to deter the birds from entering the pit area. We get almost all of them, we are over 99% effective. There's around 10,000 miles of mine shafts and tunnels under the city of Butte. That's not an exaggeration. 10,000 miles. Groundwater and rainwater had to be constantly pumped out. Nearby pumps moved somewhere around 300 litres a second. But when this pit shut down in 1982, so did the pumps, and water started to flood the old tunnels and the pit. The rock here is full of iron pyrite. Combine that with oxygen and water and as it rusts, you get sulfuric acid. That in turn, breaks down other metals and minerals in the rock. And the result is that the water down there is so acidic and so contaminated with toxins that nothing except a few hardy bugs can live in it. The deep groundwater here is utterly contaminated but it's a closed system. The sulfuric acid can't get in or out, for now, because there's one more catch. Water is still flowing into the pit and if it gets above a certain level, then the nasty stuff will start to leak out. So down here we're at the Berkeley Pit pump station. Right now the Berkeley Pit is the sink or the sump, like a hydraulic control for the system. So what we're doing here is we're pumping, treating and discharging water from the system. And this includes bringing Berkeley Pit water on line and treating it through an existing water treatment plant. If the Berkeley Pit is not maintained, the protective water level would be reached in July of 2023. pH at one time was as low as about 2.2 or 2.3. Currently up to about 4.1. The water that we'll be discharging from the site will be clean water, about 7 million gallons per day. 2100 gallons per minute. Since 1982, the water level has been increasing, in the neighborhood of about six to seven feet per year. Later this year would be the first time since 1982 that the pit water level will be maintained and held steady. Tourists go here because, well, tourists will go anywhere interesting and this is interesting. In 2007, Dr Phaedra Pezzullo of the University of Colorado, Boulder, coined the term 'toxic tourism'. The fact that people will come to gawp or be shocked or just to take a selfie, and say that they saw the mile-wide pool of toxic waste. And there are much worse ways to raise awareness and tell the world, hey, this is pretty screwed up and we need to do something about it. A $3 admission fee is, well, it's capitalism. In the United States, a country that codified the idea of the roadside attraction, it almost seems normal to pay for a ticket to see the mile-wide, incredibly toxic pit. Thanks to all the team from Montana Resources and the Berkeley Pit who helped make this video happen. You can find out more about them by pulling down the description."
263,The only bit of Louisiana's coast that isn't sinking,"        I'm about to step onto brand new land. And admittedly, yes, it is a little bit underwater right now because, well, that river there is in flood. But 50 years ago, this would've been open water and I would've been jumping off this boat up to my neck. And yes, I was extremely nervous about that little jump [laughs] 'cause that's the first time I came off here. But yeah, this is the Wax Lake Delta. 50 years ago: no trees, no plants, nowhere to put your feet, I would've been swimming, on a coastline that's famous not for building up but for eroding. And to explain why, we have to go just a little bit inland. The Mississippi River is so murky and brown because it's filled with silt and sediment. Throughout history, roughly every thousand years or so, deposits of that sediment build up enough that the river basically blocks itself and then takes a different and steeper route to the ocean, at least until silt builds up on that new route and the river moves again. That massive and relatively sudden change is called an avulsion. And avulsions were fine until modern times, when the industry that you can hear and the livelihoods of untold numbers of people rely on the river being exactly where it is. But in the past, every time that humans have tried to fix the rivers around here, there have been unintended consequences. We built levees like this one to protect towns like Baton Rouge here, but they make the river flow faster and higher because all the water is now concentrated into one channel. And because they restrict water flow, they move the flooding upstream, which means the next neighbourhood over has to build their levee higher to deal with it. There are regulations to prevent 'levee wars', when communities have to keep building their levees higher because their neighbours are doing the same. Those regulations aren't always followed. And downstream, levees mean that instead of a wider river during floods, you get a faster river, eroding away those silt and sediment deposits, literally washing away the land that it once created. And now, the river doesn't flood as much, so the ground next to it dries out and settles and sinks. Louisiana's coastline is disappearing. In 2011, government cartographers retired 35 placenames, taking them off the maps because those islands and bays just don't exist anymore. They're just open water. But there is one place on the coastline, a couple of hours south of Baton Rouge, where land is appearing again, and that is also an unintended consequence, which brings us back to where I was standing at the Wax Lake Delta. The Wax Lake Outlet is a channel off the Atchafalaya River. The Atchafalaya River is a channel off the Mississippi. So, a channel off a channel off the Mississippi River. [thunder booms] Excuse me, I heard a little thunder. Okay, no, we-Let's get out of here.   The Wax Lake Outlet was built in the early  1940s and it was designed to pull water off the Atchafalaya River and reduce flood stress on Morgan City. One of the unintended consequences was the development of a delta at the mouth of the Wax Lake Outlet. And so, the Wax Lake Outlet and the Atchafalaya River carries a lot of sediment, and then when it gets to the coast, the river flow slows down and all of the sediment in the river settles out. We're talking tens of millions of metric tonnes of sediment every year. This is solid enough land that you can walk on it and you can stand on it. Louisiana has lost nearly 2,000 square miles' worth of land over the last century, and there's a large effort to rebuild the coast. A big part of that effort is to try to partially divert the flow of the Mississippi River to create new deltas that are like the Wax Lake Delta. And so, people like myself want to study the Wax Lake Delta so we understand how deltas build so we can better design coastal restoration projects. It's important to restore the coast, one, to push back the sea to enhance flood protection in Louisiana, and it's also a place where you could potentially bury carbon. We have too much CO2 in the atmosphere, and highly productive deltas like the Wax Lake may be one of those places where we can do that. I often feel like the numerical models that we have to understand the coast are pretty darn good. The much more difficult thing to model is to understand people and how people are going to behave with this changing coast. And I feel like, that, we barely even know the equations. We don't necessarily know even what the rules are to govern how do people deal with a stressful changing environment. So, yes, it's still wet underfoot here right now because this whole area's still in flood. But that just means there's more mud, more sediment being deposited. This land is going to be a couple of centimetres higher and this coastline is going to be just a little bit safer. I've sunk about an inch into the mud and it's gone in my shoes. It's in my shoes. Right, I should totally have gone with the sandals. [laughing] [grunts] All right."
264,These tunnels stop part of Tokyo flooding,"The city of Tokyo is built around and over rivers. When you travel around here, it is striking just how often you cross water. And from up above, you can see this whole area is flat, low-lying coastal land. Some parts of Tokyo even sit below sea level. They've sunk because of decades of pumping out groundwater. The two and a half million people in those low-lying areas are protected by a network of flood gates and aging levees, which'll be fine unless sea levels rise. But even inland, a huge part of this megacity is built in river basins and flood plains. And as the climate breaks down, rain storms here are getting more intense and more frequent. If you want to prevent river flooding, or drain neighbourhoods that are starting to flood: where do you put the water? If you pump it out of that neighbourhood, you're likely just moving the flood next door. The best plan would, in theory, be to pump the floodwater all the way to the ocean, or at least to a tidal river that can deal with it. But for that, you would need tunnels and buffer tanks on an almost unimaginable scale. Now, despite what some breathless blog posts might claim, the whole metropolis doesnât have that. But there is one place, about an hour north of the centre of Tokyo, that does. This is the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel, or at least, one part of it: the holding tank. It is almost impossible to convey the scale of this on camera. [IN JAPANESE:] If the Otoshifurutone and Naka rivers start to flood, this is where the water will drain to. Actually, where the water is sort-of still draining to. There was a massive rainstorm about two days ago, and there is still water in the system. I am not allowed down on the floor, just in case. [IN JAPANESE:] This tank, and the kilometres of tunnels and all the silos that bring water to it, cost nearly a quarter of a trillion yen, that's about two billion US dollars, at the end of the 20th century. That was when the Japanese government was spending money to finance enormous infrastructure projects like this, to try and stimulate the economy. Which, for long-term security, is great: but it took a national recession to make this happen. A plan like this only works if a government wants to spend a colossal amount of money, and in the 21st century, there aren't many governments willing to do that. Thank you to all the team here for letting me down in the tank, and up on these catwalks. You can find out more about them and their work at the link in the description. Echo! [echoes continue and fade] That goes for a long time."
265,The world's first solar powered train,"When I heard that there was a 100% solar powered train in the world, I thought: that's a ridiculous idea. Of course solar power isn't enough to move a massive, heavy train. There isn't even a practical solar powered car on the market, and yet, here it is. Welcome to Byron Bay, Australia, home of the Byron Bay Railroad Company. This is a 70-year-old vintage train. It was built in 1949, after the Second World War. And we've converted it now to the world's first solar powered train. Our train would typically have had two diesel engines, and we've taken one of those out, kept one as a backup, and that's been replaced essentially with the batteries, and a new gearbox, and all the control equipment. We have a 70-ton train, but in terms of a full-size train, that's quite light. It's also renowned to be very quiet in the industry. I'm the train driver of the only solar train in the world. I've been driving the train from day one, which has been operating for about 16 months now. I had my own business for 31 years. I sold the business 10 years ago and basically did myself out of a job. And then this job came along. And so I put my hand up for it, and, yes, they trained me up and here I am driving a train. Actually, driving a solar train is easier than driving it when it's in diesel. Our track's three kilometres long and the train goes from Byron Bay back to what we call our North Beach Station. And it's got a slight grade up, slight grade down in certain sections. So what we do is we throttle up to get us up to the first hump in the road and then we coast for the next, probably, half a kilometre, then we throttle back up again to get us over the next little hump in the road. And that's how we get ourselves into Byron. And doing it that way, we don't use near as much battery power. And that's the name of the game, save the battery power. You got to remember that the train weighs 70 tonne. So once it gets up its momentum, you've got steel on steel so it just keeps rolling on. We have regen braking and we use it as much as possible. That throws some charge back into the batteries every time we use it. The battery on this train is roughly the same size as you'd find in an electric car. It stores 77 kilowatt-hours. And a run back and forth uses about five. Now that means this takes more power than an electric car but not that much more considering it carries 70 people. The solar on the train works in two ways. We have 6Â½ kilowatts of solar panels on the roof of the train. And then in addition to that, we have a 30 kilowatt array on top of the platform here. So the combined there is 36Â½ kilowatts and we can produce, on a good day, up to 150 kilowatt-hours of energy. The solar panels on the roof of the train are constantly doing a trickle charge of the battery on the train. And then a couple of times a day, just to top up the battery, we plug it into here at the platform like an electric car, using electric car equipment. This is a net carbon positive project and in the first year of service we put 60,000 kilowatt-hours back into the grid on top of the power that we used which is enough to power 17 three-bedroom houses. As an example, in the peak of summer with the low amount of energy used per trip, we can actually run a whole day's service without topping up the charge, just from the 6Â½ kilowatt array on the roof of the train and the 77 kilowatt battery bank. This isn't something that would work everywhere or even that should work everywhere. The weather here is perfect for solar power and this is a small independent railway with one bit of straight flat track and a train that can spend some time plugged in. For most railroad companies, it'll be a better idea to add a third rail or some overhead power lines and run the train off the regular power grid and then put some solar panels on the station roof as well. But as a demonstration of what's possible with solar power, and as a neat way to bring some tourists to your train line, it's a pretty good idea. We've been running for a little bit over a year. We've carried over 100,000 passengers in that time and we haven't missed a service. Thanks to all the team at the Byron Bay Railroad Company. Pull down the description for more about them and about this train."
266,The one-lane bridge shared by cars and trains,"In New Zealand, one-lane bridges are a common enough thing that tourists are warned about them. The rules are simple. Approach with care, go slowly, and if there's someone coming the other way then sometimes there are signs that'll tell you who has priority. There is an exception to that rule in just a couple of places, though, which is that, regardless of what those signs say... [train horn] always let the train go first. Dunedin Railways started operating in the 1990s and we run a tourist train business. We cart about 80-90,000 passengers a year. The route is 154km return from Dunedin and follows a river gorge up through the Taieri River up onto the Strath Taieri plain. The scenery is spectacular, how they built it. They started in 1879, it was completed in 1891, all by hand. It is a challenging route. It's really up and down. Just to be clear, this isn't a tram, or a trolley bus, or light rail, this is an actual train running on the street here, because that was a better option than trying to build a second bridge on a very quiet road. Technically, I guess this is just a very strangely shaped level crossing? And there are a few other bridges like this around the world, but almost all of them have lights and sirens and barriers to keep cars separated when there's a rain approaching. Here, you just take care and listen out for the train horn. When the road bridge further up the river failed, they made the rail bridge a road bridge. There used to be a lot more in the country. It was a cheap option, why build two bridges when you can build one? They were mainly built in less populated areas because trains and cars don't usually combine very well(!) so you wouldn't build them in the cities. But the cars just have to follow the road rules. There's stop signs at either end of the bridge and you don't do line speed going up onto a road-rail bridge, you're doing 10kph, blowing the whistle and all that sort of thing. Hindon Road-Rail Bridge is really there only to give access to two sheep stations, so there's not that much traffic on it. Rarely you come across a car anyway. The train is going at a speed that it can stop pretty easily, and usually the cars have to back up. We've never had a problem on a road-rail bridge. Level crossings are worse."
267,The circle visible from space,"I don't think there's a better example of how humanity changed the landscape of New Zealand than right here, at this dividing line between wild forest and managed farmland. It's a little bit difficult to see close up, though. For the best view, you need to go a few kilometres that way. In the centre of that circle is Mount Taranaki, a stratovolcano on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. And from six kilometres up, the landscape looks bizarre: there are very few large-scale circular features like that in the world. Taranaki is also one of the most symmetrical volcanoes on the planet, which adds to the effect. This mountain is one of the natural features of New Zealand that's been granted the legal rights of a person, in sort of the same way that corporations are considered people in a lot of countries. Although the nuances of that, and the history of war and land confiscation that got us to this point, is something that this British tourist is not qualified to talk about. So I'll put some links at the end of the video and in the description. Before humans arrived in New Zealand, about 700 years ago, most of the country looked something like this: dense forest. Not that exact species of tree everywhere, but certainly that sort of haven for wildlife and birds. MÄori settlers cleared some of it after they landed here, but the European settlers, a few centuries later, they cleared forest on an industrial scale. Trees that were valuable for construction were cut down, and anything else was burned, making way for this sort of pastureland. About half of New Zealand was eventually converted to grasslands for grazing for imported species of animals, on imported species of grass. The national government reserved an area around that peak, to help defend against flash floods and erosion. In 1900, that area became a National Park, defined as a circle six miles in radius from the summit of the mountain, plus a few other interesting parts on the edge. Farmers, of course, cleared everything up to that circle, as far as they could legally go, and the result was this mathematical line made real, this wonderful view out the window as you fly from Auckland to Wellington. Although at some point, that flight's going to become a bit more difficult. As is living around here. Because Taranaki is not an extinct volcano. Under that rock, there's still magma ready to go: Taranaki is active, just quiet right now, and it's overdue. On average, there's at least a minor eruption every 90 years. And it's been more than 150 since the last one. One study said there's an 80% chance of some sort of eruption in the next fifty years. There will be warning signs and plenty of time to evacuate folks, but if it's the big one, the government's civil defence evacuation plans describe the entire National Park as an area where people ""are unlikely to survive"". And it could shut down air traffic over most of the North Island: engine-shredding ash will probably blow east right into that flightpath. And the cone of the mountain could collapse entirely, as it's done several times in the eons when humans weren't around to see it. So if you are flying between Auckland and Wellington any time soon, and the skies are clear: do enjoy the view. Because at some point, it's going to change."
268,The Hundred-Tonne Robots That Help Keep New Zealand Running,"I've talked about containerization on this channel before, but this video is different because it includes the phrase ""hundred-tonne autonomous robots"". New Zealand is a long way from almost everywhere else on the planet. Humans only reached here about 700 years ago. If you look at a globe of the earth, in almost every direction for thousands of miles there's nothing but ocean. Which means that the Ports of Auckland here and the other ports like it all around the country are vital to keeping New Zealand running. Well the fantastic thing about the Ports of Auckland is that we're right in the middle of the city, but the downside of that is that we're quite constrained. We're not in the sixties when you could just pave over everything and build out into the harbour. We can't expand anymore, so we've got a fixed footprint, not so great when your city's growing at a massive rate of knots. When your get your head around the fact that you can't do the old fashioned things like just keep reclaiming land, it becomes quite an exciting challenge. How do we put the maximum number of containers through this little plot of land? Like every other major port in the world, almost all the goods that arrive or leave here are going to be in a standardised shipping container. For incoming goods, once a container has  been unlocked from the ship, these giant quay cranes take it and move it down to ground level. And then it's moved to a holding area by a straddle carrier, ready for a truck or a train to take it on the last miles of its journey. Those straddle carriers look like something out of an old Gerry Anderson show, but they're real. They weigh 70 tonnes before they even pick up a container and the newest straddle carriers which are being tested right here, right now, are automated. Fully loaded, that is a hundred-tonne robot just moving around at speed. We are automating while still operating the terminal, it's an absolutely crazy thing to do but we have to do it because of our space limitations. So it's a bit like, you're having open heart surgery while you're still playing tennis. So we're now getting robots which can work much more steadily and stack higher and stack closer together. And so we can get a lot more capacity out of our same piece of land. It's really really precise. The A-STRADs can stack containers with an accuracy of a couple of centimetres. That actually can pose a problem because the wear and tear on the pavement is always in the same place at the same time. So we've got a fairly cool solution to that, which is called stack shuffling. So in a manned terminal, of course for the straddle operators to know where to put the containers, we paint lines on the ground. Over a number of years that wears out the pavement. We get ruts where the straddles drive repetitively and damage on the asphalt where the container corners land all the time. And of course that then requires repair, which is disruptive and expensive. So with A-STRADS they refer of course to an electronic map, they need no lines on the ground. So that enables us to then move the container stacks just a little bit and that spreads the wear and tear on the pavement over a much longer period of time. GPS isn't quite precise enough for this job, and there's a lot of flat steel surfaces that could reflect or block those signals. So there's a local positioning system installed here as well. Synchronised transmitters all around the port work like miniature GPS satellites. And equipment on each straddle carrier triangulates the location using the light speed delay from each one. Which is literally sub-nanosecond precision. They don't just look at the timing signal itself, they track the phase of each transmitter's carrier signal. The Locata system is our system for the positioning of the machines. We have these two antennas on top of each machine in order to also be aware of the orientation of the machine at each moment. But it's a local system. Everything which is directly related to the main safety of the straddle carrier is on the straddle carrier. Also the navigation itself happens on the straddle carrier. Whilst we're automating a large part of our operation, we're actually keeping people in a part of it. So we'll actually have interactions between manned straddle carriers and automated straddle carriers, and that's never been done in this way anywhere else in the world before. The system has multiple layers of safety. The first one is the simplest, which is we put a big fence around the terminal to keep people out. Beyond that, then, we've got a computer system that monitors where all the machines are all the time so it's both manned and the automated straddles. It manages the interactions between those machines, and it's a standalone fail-safe system. And then as sort of last layer of defence, the A-STRADs have laser scanners on them which will detect the presence of an obstacle in front of the machine and stop it before there's a collision. We've got a different type of automation here. We have straddle carriers that are only automated in part of the terminal. And the reason we've done that is again the throughput. So our crane drivers are really fast, under the crane we've got lots and lots of steel, it's really hard to get those signals and automate. So by keeping manual operations underneath these cranes here, and then automating the yard, we get more capacity. The robots do the really boring stuff like moving containers around, digging out the bottom one to put it on a truck, and the people do the really tricky stuff. You know, the technology will no doubt improve, but for now, that mixture of people and robots is the perfect mix. Thank you to all the team at the Ports of Auckland. Pull down the description for more about them, and their work."
269,The sculpture that looks like a real-life cartoon,"Once or twice a month, the private art collection at Gibbs Farm in New Zealand opens up to the public. The tickets are free, but they go very quickly. The art here in this collection isn't just paintings on a wall: it's land art, made by moving vast amounts of soil and earth, or it's sculpture on a scale seen only in a few places in the world. And the most famous piece in the collection is this: Horizons, by Neil Dawson. Fifteen metres wide, they height of a four-storey building. Depending on who you ask, it either resembles a piece of corrugated iron blown in from a distant farm... or a giant paper tissue that's been thrown away. And it looks like a cartoon that's been sketched on the landscape, but it's made of welded steel, and I think the thing that sells the optical illusion best is that little spike, that little incomplete fold. Which is, yeah, actually a big spike of metal, but from a distance, your brain just doesn't see that. This was one of the first pieces commissioned for Gibbs Farm. And it was commissioned: Alan Gibbs, who owns this farm and the art on it, is one of the wealthiest folks to come from New Zealand. And rather than collect art that had already been made, he hired internationally famous artists and sculptors and said, in short: here's some money. Make me a thing that'll go here. This farm is basically one rich millionaire's playground. Heck, it was originally bought as a fairly remote place to drive a collection of vintage military vehicles. The art came second. In a 2017 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Gibbs said: âItâs not a public park. Itâs not a charity. ""Iâm happy to let people see it,"" he said, ""but itâs still primarily a family holiday retreat.â Of course, everything here is well documented; you can look online and see every sculpture from basically every angle possible. But if you actually want to stand here and experience that optical illusion for yourself, if the feeling of being here, in person, is important to you... well, Gibbs Farm is only open occasionally. You'll have to join the rest of  in the queue for tickets."
270,The Last Play-For-Cash Fascination Parlor,"I'm in Hull, a small seaside town near Boston in the northeast United States. I grew up visiting the British equivalent of towns like this, and sure, it's the middle of winter, it is so bitterly cold here that the ocean foam has frozen. There aren't any tourists, nearly everything's closed for the season, but this town still feels a little like home to me. There is one place on the seafront here that's open specially today though. And it's the last play-for-cash Fascination Parlor in the world. A lot of these did exist back in the day. I'm not exactly sure how many, all I do know is: this is the longest standing. A hundred years old last year. It was transported up here sometime over the past century from Coney Island and now sits here on Nantasket Beach. There are 64 machines here, so on a busy night here we'll have 64 players. The game begins with your bill on the glass, we'll range anywhere from a quarter to a dollar and maybe two dollars at a point in time. We have the entertainment and gaming licence for anyone to come in and play, as long as you're over 18 years old. It is a game of skill. Like everything in life, there is some luck that goes into it, but certainly there are some skilled players that I have witnessed over the past year. So here are the rules: roll the balls into the holes. Each time you sink a ball, the corresponding light on the board switches on. First to get a line of five, horizontal, vertical or diagonal, wins, or in some cases, first to light up the whole board. And here, you win cash. There are other Fascination parlors but this is the only one where you're not playing for tokens you can redeem, you're not playing against the house, you are playing against everyone else. And if win, you're taking their money. With the house taking a cut, of course. But it is winter, it's the off-season, there are no tourists, so today I am just playing against Chas, the owner. Do you have three balls there? I do, I'm ready to go, how 'bout yourself? Alright, so it's a dollar? Dollar on the glass. Where's my dollar bill? Think I might be out, but let me double check. Do you need to borrow a dollar(?) I think I do. [laughs] Thank you sir. Alright dollar on the glass. Dollar on the glass. Alright, good luck Tom. Alright. Three, two, one, roll 'em. [balls rattling] So, we're playing to cover here. Playing to cover. Okay. [CHAS] ""It is winter right now, ""so the plan for the next few months is to reestablish the arcade, ""shake it up a little bit in there, ""meaning we're looking to make it easy ""for everyone to join, understand the rules, ""and get in here and be a part of the fun."" How do you aim? [CHAS] ""Every so often, these games will peter out because of their age, ""and there's a local gentleman ""who comes in on a weekend, fixes them for us, ""so we get right back at it the next week. """"It is still running on century-old technology, ""just a few different components are changed in and out, of course. ""They are all tied together into one circuit and work amongst themselves."" Am I in the lead? I think I'm in the lead, just. Oh yeah, it's by three or four there! I gotta catch up. [CHAS] ""I think there's a place for it to expand and grow ""and be in a lot of different places throughout the world ""but the reason it isn't everywhere is, I think, ""we are a part of the technological era, ""and with different ways that you can stay busy nowadays, ""cell phones and gaming consoles, televisions, ""there are other things that pull away from old-fashioned fun, if you will."" It's just not... yes, okay, three! I've got three, you've got four. [CHAS] ""We're going to continue to build off of the history that Fascination, ""here on Nantasket Beach, has had for decades. ""I've heard numerous stories of the folks ""that used to run this over the past five or six decades, ""even more, and I wish these walls could talk ""because there would be a lot to talk about."" Oh, come on, I've got one. [TOM] ""What I love about this is that these are ""century-old machines, built with the same relays ""that powered old telephone exchanges, and they're all interlocked together, ""in one really complicated circuit. ""No microelectronics, no wifi, just a lot of things that go clunk and buzz."" [CHAS] ""So when someone lights up the board, ""everyone on the sidewalk, everybody in here ""can hear it and they know about it. ""There's usually cheering, all the lights on the board go off ""and the gentleman calling the game, or the woman calling the game, ""will make the announcement that the winner is at, for example, 'table 13!'"" This has got to be it, come on. I've hit the one next to the one I need six times now. Game over, Tom! [bell ringing] Winner, winner! Good game sir, I'll take that and I'll take that. Yep, so close. [bell ringing, then stops] That was genuinely fun. That was, isn't it? The cool thing is, you get these folks who have never played before, they sit down, have just as much fun as we just had and whether they've played it once or twice before, next thing you know they're here for three hours long, and as you can see, it seems easier than it actually is. Yeah, cause the first one's like, oh, I'm lighting everything up, and then, you cannot nail the one. Yeah, you cannot, you look and you try probably twelve times. Yeah. [laughs] Thank you. Yes sir, thank you Tom. Thank you to Chas and all the team here at the Paragon Boardwalk. You can pull down the description for more about them and about the Fascination Parlor."
271,The broken building that must not be destroyed,"This is St Peter's Seminary, about an hour west of Glasgow in Scotland. Or rather, it was. It was built in the 1960s to be a training school for priests, and I think it's a beautiful ruin of a building. But then, I like Modernist architecture like this. In 1992, this was put on the list of historic Scottish buildings in category A, which means that it's of national or international importance. And architecturally, it is one of the most important modern buildings in Scotland. But, by the time it was listed, it had already been closed for years. The Catholic church had decided that priests should train in towns and cities, not in remote places like this. And besides, times were changing. There weren't as many people who wanted to be priests. No one was interested in buying the place, and the church couldn't afford to keep an empty and extremely high-maintenance building running for no purpose. One of the troubles with a unique structure like this is that it's expensive and difficult to keep repaired. So, a quarter of a century later, what's left looks... rough. The Archdiocese of Glasgow has been responsible for it since the moment it opened. It was building which was very difficult to reuse, because it had been custom built. No developer wanted a building that had a huge, concrete chapel in it. We have a responsibility to try and preserve the ruin, as best we can. It is now a ruin. It's covered in graffiti, it's inaccessible, it's dangerous. We have, by statute, to try and maintain some kind of security in that area, to insure it and so on. But after 40 years, we are at our wits' end. In 40 years we have worked with every imaginable idea. Developers have thought of turning it into a community centre, or a hotel complex, and everything in between. There were inherent weaknesses in the building. Those who lived there have nightmarish stories of water ingress, for example, of the fact that the wind would blow so strongly through the windows, that curtains would be lifted to be almost horizontal. So the building itself was not an easy building to live in or work in, which made it even more difficult to find an alternative use for it. One arts organisation spent millions on making it safer, removing asbestos and old fittings, using it as a stage for light shows, hoping to turn it into an arts venue. But then they ran out of money. And besides, by design, this building's in the middle of nowhere. There's a village a mile down the road, but that's it. There are better places for arts venues. And there's no way in law to just abandon a building like this. You can 'tjust decide that it doesn't spark joy anymore and donate it to a charity shop. And if definitely can't be knocked down, because it's a really significant, listed building. So it's not just a listed building, it's a grade A listed building. It's the highest form of listing possible, and we are required to stick to all sorts of rules about not using it for any alternative purpose, not amending it, trying to keep the area around safe. Legally, we would give that building away, with the estate, but whoever takes it on takes on responsibility for insurance, for security, for upkeep and so on. So it's not so easy. You literally can't give it away. There have been expressions of interest, but when it comes down to it, it's a question of money, of finance. Because the building itself swallows vast amounts of money, and even to maintain it in its current ruined state, costs the Archdiocese something like Â£60,000 a year. People have looked at the area around, because it's on a beautiful estate. They have looked at perhaps building houses there and using the profit from that. But that has been denied because there are greenbelt issues which prevent that, too. And so there's something tragic about it, there's something haunting about it. It's unrealistic to expect some sort of deus ex machina. We remain open to working with anyone who wants to come forward with plans, with ideas, but at the same time, realistically, this is bigger than us. This is something for the state, something for the nation. And most people would probably say, ""what a mess"". Those that understand buildings, and that have an understanding of brutalist architecture, would see it as an extraordinary treasure. That's the reality. It is both. If this was centuries old, rather than decades, it'd be a national treasure. The Scottish government would probably pay to restore it. You could charge an admission fee. Parents would bring their kids to picnic in the grounds. And the idea of spraying graffiti on it would be abhorrent. But, apparently, it isn't. Despite the fact that this is a one-of-a-kind historic religious building. This place has enormous historical and cultural value but a negative financial value. And that, it turns out, is a very difficult place to be in."
272,The canyon that humans made by accident,"Providence Canyon, a couple of hours' drive from Atlanta, is known as Georgia's Little Grand Canyon. This network of gorges and gullies reaches over 40 metres deep, and it's beautiful. Even without the artificial saturation boost that a lot of photographers give it. This is known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. There is just one problem with that description, though: this is man-made, by accident. This is a scar in the Earth, and it's a scar that'll take a very long time to heal. The ground here is made of unconsolidated sediment. That means I'm standing on loose sand and clay that was deposited tens of millions of years ago on what was then the sea floor. It's stable, of course, but it's never been compacted into solid rock or cemented together by geology and time. It's not going to collapse, but if you draw a line from, say, desert sand, where nothing sticks together, to solid rock, the sort of thing that miners have to blast with dynamite... the ground here is definitely on this end of the scale, for a long way down. Tree root systems, grass, and other plants all help to stabilise it. And that was fine for millions of years, and through most of human history, until settlers manifested their destiny all over this continent. At the start of the 19th century, this whole area was flat forest, none of these canyons were here. Settlers cleared the area of all its trees and ploughed the soil for agriculture. Either they didn't know about crop rotation and soil management or perhaps they didn't care, seeing a whole continent laid out before them. Soon, the little drainage paths that rainwater took after storms started to erode and become bigger, and bigger, and... bigger. With soil like this, it only took a few decades before this landscape formed. A century and a half later, new trees are starting to stabilise some of it, but it's still changing and eroding. The park management has to move these fences occasionally; sometimes they'll find that one of the spires out there has just fallen after heavy rain. There are strict no-climbing warnings here, because, well, the rock you're holding onto could just fall away and dissolve in your hand. So my question is: should this count as a natural wonder? It is part of nature. People do come to wonder at it. All those colors are from the different minerals that are in the soil: so this is a look back through those millions of years of geological history, and those millions of years are unquestionably natural. But exposing them: that was very much human. [rumbling noise] So I'm hoping the microphone picked up that noise. Er, because as soon as I turned my camera off, there was a massive noise, and I'm fairly sure that was a rockfall. From this cliff. Which is worrying. It's probably fine. It's probably fine."
273,The city of golf carts,"Some American cities have buses. Some use trams and trains. And there's one... that uses golf carts. My name is Vanessa Fleisch and I am the mayor of Peachtree City, Georgia. It's a small city of about 35,000 people that is about 20 minutes south of Atlanta. It's asphalt paths, we have over 100 miles of them. They range from 8 feet to 10 feet wide in some places. They're used for golf carts mostly. We have over 11,000 registered golf carts in the city. Obviously, pedestrians, bicyclists, all kinds of traffic is on these paths. Morning! You do have to register them? Yes, you do. The people in the city do register them. There's someone else approaching us now. I assume it's like regular roads. You pass on the right and... Correct. Yeah? Yeah. It's a parallel road network, basically. The majority of the city is accessible by carts and that's a huge attraction because parents can pick up their kids at school if they want to. And some of the kids can drive themselves? Yes, the younger kids or the sophomores at the local high schools are allowed with their learner's permit to drive their carts to school. Wow. It's a bit of freedom that they enjoy. And I guess if it's limited to 20 miles an hour, there's less of a chance of a bad bump. So, this is the high school. This is. There's parking at the high school for 615 carts. That is a lot of golf carts. Do all the students leave at once here? Is it just a traffic jam of golf carts? It is a traffic jam of golf carts and it's not always pretty. Some of them have a limiter? They do, but sometimes they can be removed and they go faster than they should, which isn't good. No, that's exactly what I'd have done at age 15 with my own golf cart. I would have removed the limiter on it. Some of the carts have heaters inside them and radios. You can soup them up as much as you want really. After they saw the popularity in the '70s what they did was they required, whenever there was a new subdivision of houses built, that they connected the paths. For the most part, the cart paths are laid out at the same time they lay out the roads. So, what are the road rules here? It's like you're in a regular vehicle, you've just got more paths that you can go on? Yes, and if there is no path, you are allowed to be on the road, but that's why we've expanded the paths because we're trying to keep people off of them as much as possible. Sometimes people who have never been here have been caught on cart paths with their cars thinking that that's the right thing to do. Wow! I wanted to take you through a drive-thru. So up here is McDonald's. I'm still getting over the fact that I'm in a drive-thru in a golf cart! Thank you. Should point out, not sponsored. This is not product placement. The brakes on this are very good. I'm sorry, it's very abrupt on them. Better than the alternative. Peachtree City was a planned community, right? Correct. How did it go from ""we're gonna build some houses here"" to we're gonna have something that that I don't think any other city in America has? It got started originally as a lake retreat for Atlanta residents. And the people who were here, basically only on the weekends, they started taking their golf carts on the roads leaving from playing golf. This whole separate network came up as a result of that to get them off the roads on their way home. So, this was founded in the 1950s. 1959 by Joel Cowan. He was a college student when he designed and founded this city. Wow. It's very quiet... See what I mean? Death wish, good grief! Along here, this is Lake Peachtree-Sorry, I got distracted by ducks. The Founder, Mr. Cowan and his cousin were the ones that put up the dam and spillway originally that made this lake. 100,000 gallons a second goes over this. People do pay taxes to pay towards these roads. It costs us $1.8 million a year to maintain what we have as well as the 29 bridges and 29 tunnels. This is a pretty affluent city, which I guess is one of the reasons that the golf cart paths work, but there are a lot of cities like that in America and I'm trying to work out why it's worked here and it hasn't elsewhere. Most mayors when they see or hear about us and they think ""oh, we can do that"", well, they've got older cities, so they really can't. And I guess part of it is cost. Part of it is you need a huge amount of upkeep and tax and everything to make this work, but it's also because you need to set the whole thing up or it doesn't work. You can't have a quarter of a cart network because no one will buy a cart and no one will use it. You need to connect everything or it's not worth it. Right. Lovely! Thank you very much. Thank you. You can find out more about Peachtree City in the links in the description. I've just realised there's no seat belts on this. No."
274,An American Stonehenge: The Mysterious Georgia Guidestones,"These standing stones are enormous and made of solid granite. When you're near them, they are genuinely impressive and imposing, the sort of thing that makes you wonder how ancient people ever managed to raise them up, and to place them so precisely that they act as an astronomical calendar. These particular stones don't make you wonder that, though. Because these are the Georgia Guidestones, in the USA, and they were put up in 1980 by modern people with modern equipment. They are not a theme park fiberglass replica, though, they're more than a hundred tons of rock and they are built to last. Inscribed on them in eight languages are what seem to be rules for a future post-apocalyptic civilisation, the sort of thing that maybe seemed like a reasonable way to send a message to the far distant future in an era when the Cold War was looking dicey and Ronald Reagan's finger was very close to the nuclear button. The person or people who paid for these stones stayed anonymous, so no-one knows if they were actually intending to troll conspiracy theorists. Maybe they really were just hoping to create a modern Stonehenge, something that could be taken as a set of principles for the world's population to follow as we recovered after an apocalypse. This might seem like a reasonable purchase, even altruistic from a certain perspective, if you're the sort of person who writes a story in your head that says, yes, I'll be dead in a nuclear fireball, but if civilization survives, perhaps someone will come across these, perhaps some language will have survived, perhaps I will have influenced the entire path of a civilization to come. It'd take a lot of money and a lot of ego, but then, it was America in the 1980s, so perhaps we should just be surprised that there aren't more stones like this all over the place. Imagine a dozen different monuments, all with different rules, and all being followed by a different group of survivors. I don't normally speculate like this in videos, but these stones inspire some pretty good stories. And some pretty bad ones, too. Because like I said, if you wanted to inflame conspiracy theorists? Building a modern Stongehenge, that acts as an astronomical calendar, with ten commandments inscribed upon it, one of which says that you should ""guide reproduction wisely"", and another says that it'd be a really good idea to have a world population under 10% of what it currently is, and doing all that while hiding your identity? Yes, I can see why that might make people with a slightly tenuous grasp on reality a bit angry. All the best secret societies, after all, do put up giant monuments advertising their goals for the world. Maybe someday we will know the real reasons behind these stones: but until then there's a rule of thumb called Occam's Razor. The simplest solution tends to be the correct one. And a rich person who saw Stonehenge and thought ""I want one of those"" is a pretty simple solution. âª [a faint recording of the US Marine Band playing ""Nearer, My God, To Thee""] âª"
275,Testing the world's longest echo,"[whispering] I'm inside one of the Inchindown oil tanks, an old oil storage facility in Inverness, in Scotland. This tank is 237 metres long and it's not meant for humans. When it was in use by the Royal Navy all this colossal space would have been filled with fuel oil. With these oil tanks, the Royal Navy accidentally created the greatest reverberation chamber in the world. Flat surfaces enclosed by solid rock, and a chamber big enough that sound takes a whole second or more to go off the far wall and bounce back. But still narrow enough that you get lots of reverberation from all the close surfaces as well. The construction started in 1938 and it carried on right through the beginning of the war up to around about 1943. The Admiralty had decided that they required bomb-proof storage for their oil. So they set about building a number of oil tanks across Britain. And this, Inchindown, is one of them. The construction required six tanks to be built. The entire complex could easily contain 100,000 tonnes of fuel but one single Royal Navy battleship can drink 5,000 tonnes. So it could go very, very quickly. It is a truly amazing chamber of sound, a cathedral of oil and a cathedral of sound. So now I'm going to shut up for a bit. Preston here is going to fire a starting pistol, a very, very loud bang. On the screen is a visual display of that sound. Different frequencies will reverberate for different amounts of time so you will see that and hear that. And as it gets quieter we will turn up the level on the microphone so it's easier for you to hear. Right, everyone ready? Thank you to the Bannerman Group for letting us into the tunnels, to Allan, Alan and Preston for helping with everything here, to Matt Gray who is behind the camera and who's had some musical experiences over on his channel. Go for it. Aagh! That is terrifying."
276,"I hit 3,000-year-old art with a hammer","This is the Uffington White Horse and it is somewhere around 3,000 years old. It was carved into this hill in Oxfordshire before the British isles had written history, so we have no idea who made it, or why. And until humanity invented aircraft millennia later, no one could even really see it properly. The view from the ground here isn't great. We're also not allowed to fly a drone over it, so you're going to have to make do with a satellite photo to see the whole thing. This is a 3,000 year old piece of art. And I am now going to smash part of it with this hammer. We're smashing the chalk into the figure of the Horse today to preserve its appearance and keep its longevity as people have done for the last 3,000 years, otherwise it wouldn't be here. We're taking new chalk from the quarry just behind me, about 50 metres away, 10 tonnes in all. And yes, that's being applied to the Horse by the use of a club hammer. Before that though, the Horse is weeded, or ""scoured"" for the old traditional term, so we can get on to the best surface. We rechalk and scour the Horse every year now. They're all volunteers. Previous years have been years of neglect, maybe 20, 25 years, but traditionally, back in Victorian times every seven years. But we're proud of the Horse here, and we want to keep it looking its best as long as we can. Oxford University, back in the 1990s, came out with a newly developed sensor back then, which was able to determine the last time sunlight touched the bottom of the trenches on which the Horse is founded. And that put it to what we know today, 3,000 years ago. This is by far the oldest chalk figure in the country, nothing else comes anywhere near it. We don't know for sure about how the Horse was put in, or for what reason. We imagine that there might have been a wooden tower constructed from which the seer would be able to direct ""left, right, missed a bit,"" that kind of thing. Part of the mystery or the enigma of the White Horse Hill is what makes it so appealing to people that come. You can use your own imagination. What would happen if we didn't chalk the Horse? I think it would grow over within 20 or 30 years. That's what we say to the people who've been kind enough to come along today and help us; is they're actually contributing to living history here. Without that human intervention, it would grass over 25, 30 years, and be lost forever. This is art that's been preserved by generation after generation after generation after generation. Repair and upkeep that's been going on for millennia. Through the Roman empire, the medieval period, a lot of invasions, the English Civil War, the formation of the United Kingdom; all the way up to the Information Age. Every so often, groups of people have come together on this hill, to preserve this. It is a very real connection with the folks who came before us. Smashed it. Smashed it! ...nothing, just nothing."
277,Testing the sound mirrors that protected Britain,"These are the Sound Mirrors on Romney Marsh on the south-east coast of England. And in the 1930s, these were Britain's experimental early warning system against aerial attack. And with the help of a few folks, today we're going to test them. Now the small dishes over there, they were the first mirrors at this site. But sound waves from the bass of a plane engine have a wavelength that is much longer than the whole surface of those dishes. So in 1929, this 200-foot wall of concrete was constructed and to test it, we've got a drone. Now back in the '30s, there would have been microphones set up all along the edge of this concrete forecourt. And those microphones were specially designed and tuned to only pick up certain frequencies. The project lead, Dr. William Tucker, wrote that they wouldn't react to a loud air horn nearby, but when conditions were right, they would pick up the low hum of an aircraft engine 27 miles out to sea. That signal would become the twitch of a needle on a gauge in a control room behind that wall. That hole just there, that was the operator's window. Now we don't quite have that much bass today, but... Take her up! Now our engineer Ben has put a microphone here at the mirror's central focus. Thank you, Ben. And also one outside the mirror, so you can compare [drone buzzing] ...that sound. [drone buzzing] [wind noise] And, sure, 27 miles is asking a bit much, the drone is a lot quieter, conditions are nowhere near perfect, there's a lot of other noise from birds and from everything that's been built in the last century and that mirror has 90 years of damage on it, but listen. [drone buzz] [wind noise] This does still work. Okay, take it sideways! Now the mirror's focal point is different depending on the direction of the incoming plane, so the operators could work out the direction of approach based on which microphone was picking up the sound. So as the drone goes sideways, listen, [insects chirp] the focus moves and that mic doesn't pick up anything. Alright, bring her in! Now at one point, there were plans for a long string of sound mirrors across the whole of the southern English coast, but there were a lot of problems with that idea. Not only does it require a huge amount of resources to construct and maintain anything like that, it's easily swamped by other noise, cars and trains and new-build houses drowned out the signal. Any other engines in the same direction get picked up too, which meant that you could either have friendly aircraft patrolling or you could have people listening at the sound mirrors, but never both at the same time. [drone buzzes] And then humanity invented radar and building 200-foot walls of concrete became obsolete very, very quickly. So this was never used in wartime, but it does still work. There's not much technology that, er, [drone buzzes] that can survive 90 years of decay, but when your technology is a massive lump of concrete, I guess that's a little bit easier. I'm talking about the history of radar over on the RAF Starrship channel, everything that replaced this. Thank you very much to all the team from that, who helped make this happen. Humanity invented radar and building 200-foot walls of concrete [stuttering drone] became a little bit obsolete."
278,Watching for nuclear attack in the Arctic,"The shortest route between Russia and the United States is over the north pole. So if the Cold War had ever become Hot, the bombs would have been going straight over here. This is Tuktoyaktuk, on the Arctic Ocean, in the Canadian Northwest Territories. And that behind me with the domes was once the military's DEW Line: the Distant Early Warning Line. Or at least, part of it. The DEW Line was built in the 1950s: 57 radar bases ranging all the way from the Aleutian Islands to Greenland. They looked to the sky around the clock, and if any aircraft showed up on radar that weren't supposed to be there: well, there was a chance that those were Soviet bombers carrying nuclear weapons to North American targets, and the governments would have somewhere between an hour and four hours to scramble some sort of response. Construction of the DEW Line was an enormous operation. Thousands and thousands of people had to be transported to the Arctic, provided with food and housing and the hundreds of thousands of tons of equipment and supplies that they'd need to build the Line. But the military is good at logistics, or at least, the vast number of civilian contractors they hired were. All the bases were completed in just two and a half years, and North America was prepared for Soviet attack, at the cost of around half a billion dollars from the two governments. There were other costs too, less financial: for a lot of the folks that lived near the DEW Line sites, the sudden influx of people and equipment destroyed their way of life; although that's a story that I am not qualified to tell. The construction also contaminated a lot of the local environment: standards then weren't what they are now, and the cleanup is still going on. And for all that, the DEW Line lasted about five years until it was obsolete. Because shortly after it was completed, both the Soviet Union and the United States started to put their nuclear warheads not on aircraft, but on intercontinental ballistic missiles. They didn't eight or nine hours of flight over the pole, instead the first wave of attack would come from rockets that would take half an hour and go literally over the top of the DEW Line. Half of these stations were shut down  a few years later. The rest of the Line, including this station here, well, they played a role in air defense. If they weren't here, then the Soviet Union could have theoretically still sent bombers over the pole. But they weren't the shield that North America hoped that they would be. US President Eisenhower, in his memoirs, said that military technology... well, ""if it works, it's obsolete"". The DEW Line kept running, though, at least until the 90s, when a more modern system was constructed. Now, this site is part of the North Warning System, part of a modern radar defence around the whole continent that can detect basically anything inbound at any altitude. Which is why I'm not allowed near it. Governments on this side of the pole want to be sure: the Cold War might be over, but just in case, they'd better keep watching."
279,The new highway to the Arctic Ocean,"Canada's official motto translates as ""from sea to sea."" But for many years now, there's been an unofficial version: ""from sea to sea to sea."" Because Canada doesn't just have west and east coasts, it has a north one as well. Just over that hill is Inuvik, a small town of about 3,000 people in the Northwest Territories, about 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. But it's not on the Arctic Ocean. Until recently, this was the end of the Dempster Highway, about as far north as you could get by Canada's road system. There wasn't a continuous link from sea to sea to sea. Except in winter when the ice was frozen enough to support vehicles. But in 2017, after years of difficult construction over the permafrost and hundreds of millions of dollars in costs, an all-weather highway finally opened, from here to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic Ocean. So for the first time, we can drive there. ...or we could take a plane. RADIO: ""ATC clear."" It turns out that building an all-weather highway across permafrost is an incredibly difficult logistical challenge. It's now springtime. The thaw is beginning and large sections of the highway, particularly in the south, have pretty much turned to mud. There isn't quite enough gravel, it isn't compact enough, it isn't cold enough. If your vehicle gets caught there, you are hours from help and you have no cell phone service. So for safety, the government has closed the road, at least for now. But sooner or later, the road will be fixed and the highway will reopen and Tuktoyaktuk will be connected again. And that's going to change things here. I was born and raised here. 21 years ago(!) [laughter] But anyways, I lived here all my life. Never going to move. I enjoy my life here. There's just under 1,000 people that live here year-round. We do a lot of fishing, lot of hunting, berry picking, whatnot. Do the seasonal thing. When they got the go-ahead to finally start building the road, it took about five years and they would only work in the wintertime because the tundra is frozen. And they don't want to damage the tundra because once the permafrost's at surface, it's gonna start melting. They would make ice bridges. Even to where they would haul the gravel to us just so they don't do damage. Tuktoyaktuk is not isolated anymore. It's supposed to be year-round. So if you want to go travel down south, you just hop on a vehicle, if you own a vehicle, just head down. Whereas in summer months, we'd be isolated. We'd wait for the scheduled flights to come in or we go by boat, if you own a boat. Most people were for it. They were hoping the prices would go down for groceries, gas, whatnot. And the gas price did go down a bit because we had a second gas station open up. So that is one of the good things. It just gives more opportunity for everybody. Now I want to be clear. This is not some abandoned Arctic outpost. There's cell phone service here. There's a lot of people and there's fast internet. Eileen, who I interviewed, she runs the local taxi service. This is a proper town. It's just very far north. The future of the Canadian Arctic is unknown right now. Climate change means that the permafrost is melting. Sea level rise is already threatening this town. This highway is just going to be one more change in a century of them. We never did feel isolated because we're from here. Yeah, we're just used to the way we're living all the time."
280,"Making 200,000 tons of arsenic dust safe","This is Giant Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada. There are kilometres of tunnels under this rock, and chambers the size of city blocks that have been hollowed out. In the 20th century, more than 200,000 tonnes of gold were extracted from the rock underneath here. At current prices, that is somewhere north of US $8 billion worth of gold. There is a problem, though. That mining also created more than 200,000 tonnes of toxic arsenic trioxide dust. That's enough to kill everyone on Earth several times over. Over the decades, the vast majority of it was stored in the empty, abandoned chambers left behind after mining, although some of it did get out into the environment. The mine closed in 2004. When the gold ran out, the mining company went bankrupt and left the mess for the government to clean up. Arsenic trioxide has no scent, no taste, and it dissolves in water. Oh, and we're right next to Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, and next to the 10th largest lake in the world. There's 237,000 tonnes of arsenic trioxide, and they're currently stored in 14 underground chambers. The plan is to freeze the chambers. We're freezing the rock around the arsenic. See, arsenic trioxide is a fine powder. So it will form a shell. And eventually, it will freeze in and it will become a block over time. And that prevents water from getting in and getting out and keeps the arsenic trioxide contained. So each chamber, of course, is differently shaped. Some are regular shaped. Some are very rectangular shaped. So we want to freeze 10 metres beyond all boundaries of the chambers, both on the horizontal and the vertical. We're going to freeze at least to -5Â°C. The way we're going to freeze it, we're going to use a technology called thermosiphon technology, and it's basically a technology that uses the ambient air temperature, the cold air, using a long tube filed with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide, when it's a gas, it rises up to the top of the tube. And then if the air outside is colder, it will dissipate its heat, turn to a liquid, and with gravity, will drop back down to the bottom of the tube. And there, it can warm up, take the heat out of the ground, and it just continually cycles, extracting heat from the ground. Since we're in Yellowknife, north of 60Â° latitude, it's colder above ground than it is below ground for the majority of the year. Freezing the arsenic doesn't make it less toxic, but it does make it impossible for any water to seep in and then carry the arsenic out. And that was the mining company's original solution using the natural permafrost here. And it might have worked, if they hadn't mined the rock above it, exposed the permafrost layer to the elements, and started to melt it. Freezing should work, but there are skeptics, and they do have a point. Freezing requires constant upkeep. This dust is arguably worse than radioactive waste. There is no half-life here. It won't decay over time. The dust will be just as deadly in 10,000, 100,000 or a million years. So right now, there's nothing on the horizon. The freezing was deemed the best technology for the arsenic trioxide. So we will be funding research indefinitely until a different solution arises. We have frozen one of the chambers. We did what we call a freeze optimization study. We chose one of the chambers. We installed the thermosiphons, but we also installed some freezing pipes filled with glycol to do what we call an active freeze, which will be very similar to a hockey rink. So based on that study, we determined that we could use the passive technology, which is just the thermosiphons with the carbon dioxide. It just wasn't quite as fast, so it's gonna take a little bit longer, but the trade-offs are such that we don't need to use power and it's a lower maintenance over the longer term. So the remaining chambers will be frozen when we start the remediation project. It could be as early as summer of 2020, but more optimistically, 2021. Our last estimate for the cost of the project was 934 million, including the care and maintenance phase that we're in right now, remediation that we'll go into in a few years, and then the long term care and maintenance. This project has gotten approval for 100 years. These days, countries in the developed world have regulations that mean mining companies shouldn't be able to do this. We have environmental impact studies and long-term plans, and we have public scrutiny of pretty much everything. But we still have to fix the mistakes of the past and make sure that today's mining companies can't just walk away from their legacies. Thanks to everyone at the Giant Mine Remediation Project. Pull down the description for links about them and about some of the history that I couldn't fit into this video."
281,The town that was burned for science,"Behind me is the Saint Lawrence Seaway, one of the largest public works projects in North America's history. The seaway was a 1950s expansion of small canals and waterways into a huge, navigable path for shipping between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes, along with massive hydroelectric power plants. That expansion came at a cost, though. The water is high today, but when it's low you can still see the foundations of Aultsville, Ontario, one of the lost villages that were flooded to make way for progress. The residents were told that they had to move and see their old town demolished and then drowned beneath new, higher water. They didn't really have any choice in the matter. And then some scientists came along and said: if these homes are going to be demolished and then flooded anyway, can we set them on fire first? The St. Lawrence Burns was a project where they were trying to study how fires develop in buildings, specifically how it affects the survival of the occupants, as well as how fire spreads from one building to another. The researchers were scientists from the Building Research Division of the National Research Council of Canada. They burned a total of eight buildings, including six single-family dwelling homes, one two-story school, and one community hall. This was a rare opportunity, because up until this point most of the research that was done on fires were either from the aftermaths of real fires or they did it on small-scale lab tests. This, the St. Lawrence Burns, was really the first time that scientists were able to conduct in-field, full-scale research where they had control over the parameters as well as being able to observe the fire from beginning to end. There's a fair argument that, if the buildings were going to be destroyed anyway, why not take the opportunity to get useful data from them? Whether it's by fire or by water, the result was going to be the same. But it's also tough to ignore the human element. Homes that had been in families for generations, the local school, the community hall, all given a sort of insult to injury by folks coming in from outside for science. Many people weren't even told about the burns. Others chose not to watch. The volunteer fire chief said in an interview years later that watching the flames was ""devastating"". But the results were probably worth it. They got a lot of different data, including things like carbon monoxide concentration, smoke density, rise of temperature, oxygen levels. They mounted a microphone in the bedroom. They found out that the noise levels produced by a fire was not enough to wake a sleeping occupant when the bedroom door is closed. The assumption prior to the studies was that convection was the biggest cause of fire spread. But then it turns out it was actually radiant heat that was more likely the culprit. A combustible wood frame house could lead to another house 40 feet away to ignite. And even in a non-combustible building, it could cause another house about 32 feet away to ignite. The St. Lawrence Burns helped change the national building code of Canada, and it saved lives. Aultsville has almost passed out of living memory today. On aerial photos you can still see ghosts of old roads, structures that haven't been worn away by the water yet. But you could see there's a little bit of Aultsville in every modern home, in everything that's been built in the developed world from the 1960s onwards, because the results from the St. Lawrence Burns here really did change the way that everything was built. Thank you very much to Betty Chen from Articulations. Where I do videos about art and design. You'll want to go and check out her video about the ISO-standard exit sign. It's not all science and infrastructure like here, but it is a great little channel. Little? Yeah, that's fine. It's pretty little!"
282,The US-Canada border splits this road down the middle,"I'm not allowed to cross this road, because this is the town of Stanstead, Canada. On the other side of the street is Derby Line, USA and the border between the two countries runs right down this: Rue Canusa. For local residents, that can be inconvenient. I've lived here all my life, so 63 years. Today you cannot cross over the line and visit your neighbours, like years ago. If you want to cross, you have to report at customs. You know I used to cross every day, but now I probably cross once every... about once a week because I come down to the post office over here. To go through the border, basically, they ask you for your passport, they go inside, I guess they look at whether you have a record or not. They'll look at your registration of your car and a couple of minutes and you've gone through. I'm a dual citizen so I'm American and Canadian. So it's easier. This is a place where the idea of a border as a solid, easy to understand line gets a little bit fuzzy. The road doesn't run at exactly the same angle as the border, not precisely. The official line is that this is Canada and that's the USA, but both countries' maps show the road as being entirely in the US just here and entirely in Canada, up there. The houses are definitely in separate countries but the road is not quite as clear. And in practise, if I was driving I'd be okay.  Even on that side of the road, I am considered to be still in Canada, as long as I don't stop and walk up to an American house. It's fair to say that there's a little bit of leniency here, if you're just nudging the border by a few centimetres. Or if you're on that side, a couple of inches. But while I was setting up my camera here, the police turned up, lights flashing, to move along those bikers you saw earlier who were admiring the view from the other side of the road. It all seemed in good spirits, but they had crossed the border. Well, the library is part on the Canadian side and part on the American side. But you stay on the Canadian side and you stay on the sidewalk, and you go through the front door and it's permitted. On Canusa Street, there's a sidewalk on the Canadian side, so back years ago, it was tolerated that people on the American side could cross over and walk on the sidewalk, so, basically it's dangerous to walk on the side of the road and now today, well, it's not tolerated no more. I think the rule hasn't changed much, but they're more enforced. When you cross, they ask you more questions than they used to, you know, years ago. Before when you went through the border, you knew most of the customs officers and they used to wave to you, y'know. In 1783, this section of the Canada-US border was set at the 45th parallel, a line of latitude. Slightly inaccurate measurements were accepted by both countries, so it was locked in. But as for this specific road? There are local stories about drunk surveyors and pranks, but no one really knows."
283,A Town Called Asbestos,"Welcome to the town of Asbestos, Quebec. These days, 'asbestos' is a word with a sense of doom attached to it. But when this mine was opened in the late 19th century, that really wasn't the case. Which is why they named the town after it. This pit just here was the biggest asbestos mine in the world. Asbestos is a mineral, easily mined in pits like this. It can be turned into strong, cheap, fire-resistant insulation, and it was used in a huge number of building projects in the 20th century. Either as big insulation blocks, or in ceiling tiles, or just sprayed on as cladding. It was a miracle substance: it could even be woven into clothing, like military uniforms or firefighters' gloves. The catch is that it's made up of microscopic little fibrous crystals. If you break asbestos, drop it, sandpaper it, turn it into insulation and spray it around, those little fibres get into the air and build up in people's lungs. Decades later, people who've worked with absestos, or lived near an asbestos mine, they tend to develop a particularly nasty type of cancer called mesothelioma. Any exposure to asbestos fibres, however small, can be dangerous. And in this town, there was sometimes so much asbestos dust in the air that kids could write their names in it when it settled. We know all that now, so: why haven't they changed the name? In 2006, the town's then-mayor tried to change it, but the idea was voted down. And I wanted to find out why, but no-one from the town wanted to talk to me. I emailed quite a few places, the local government, the historical society. Everyone either said no, they weren't interested, or just didn't reply. They were polite, of course, they're Canadian, but it wasn't for them. And it took me perhaps a little bit too long to realise why. The name attracts people like me and viewers like you. I knew this video was going to be titled ""A Town Called Asbestos"" right away, it's the obvious title, it's got a ring to it. Which is why there's already a five-part series on YouTube from 2011 called exactly that, put together by a researcher who spent years with this town. She turned her PhD into a book, also titled ""A Town Called Asbestos"". Vice.com published a series by a German photojournalist, titled ""A Town Called Asbestos"". All the time, people turn up here, to document The Town with The Name. Some of them, like this author, are thorough and sympathetic and take decades of history into account. Some aren't. Some just set up a camera by the mine overlook, turn up for a couple of hours and film something. Others don't even visit, they just make fun of them from the other side of the world. ""Why? Because the town's name is Asbestos."" [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] How do you feel about the name? Why don't you change it? They've answered these same questions for years, and I suspect they're very, very tired of it. The clearest answer that I've found is from an interview in the Globe and Mail in 2016. Ghislain Tessier, vice-president of a local chamber of commerce, said: ""Asbestos was our lives. It was our heritage."" And I think that's the key to why this town is still called Asbestos. Because, yes, for most of the world, the name is alarming. But here, that's tempered with the fact that this mine, like a coal mine or a gold mine, it was how people made their living. Lots of people worked in the mine, and their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grandparents. It was part of their identity, a mineral that the world wanted to use, it was made right here by them, and it saved lives, and it really was something to be proud of. Asbestos, and this mine, was defended by the folks who worked here. In '97, just after France banned asbestos, four men from this town, four of the luckier ones, ran the Paris Marathon. And they were congratulated in a statement in Canada's Parliament for showing that the risks weren't that great. Because the risks were drastically downplayed by management and by government. Even after the world at large agreed how dangerous asbestos is, economics and the desire for profit meant that it was still mined for decades here. This mine only closed in 2012. It's only been a few years. Maybe the name will change, if only to stop jerks like me coming along and going, 'ooh, look at this place'. But not just yet. Dr Jessica van Horssen's book is the definitive history of the town and the mine, a lot of this video is based on it, and I thoroughly recommend it."
284,The US president has a bulletproof railcar,"These days, American presidents travel around the country on Air Force One, but in the 1940's, there was no Air Force One. Actually, there wasn't even a U.S. Air Force, they were still part of the Army. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first sitting U.S. President to fly in an airplane, back in 1943. But for most of his presidency, he used a very different form of travel. This is the Ferdinand Magellan, officially known as U.S. Car Number 1. 120 tonnes of armor-plated, bulletproof rail car. The rail car is the heaviest U.S. rail car ever built. They had to build special trucks just to support the extra weight. The reason it only weighs 285,000 pounds is that was the weight limit for U.S. railroad bridges and trestles at that time. So, the entire car is not armor-proofed, only where the President is. The car has â-inch thick bulletproof steel through most of the car, up to this point here. You can see where the rivets change from double rivets to single rivets. Regular steel here versus the bulletproof steel here. So, there's bulletproofing, there's 12-ply laminated glass, there are two escape hatches in the car to get the President out. It was never painted red, white, and blue like Air Force One. It was always painted Pullman green. When they had to park it somewhere, they would hide it with other Pullman rail cars, so it was basically hiding in plain sight. After Roosevelt's death, President Truman used the Magellan for a while, asking the engineers to get the train up to 80mph, if they could. Before television was a way to reach the masses, Truman toured America in this train, campaigning for re-election, travelling tens of thousands of miles between tiny stations known as whistle-stops, and making up to eight speeches a day. And it worked. The famous moment where he held up the newspaper that wrongly announced his defeat, that was just there, on the back of this train. Now in 1928, air-conditioning was accomplished by ice. There are ice bunkers in the car, blocks of ice were put in there, and ceiling fans across the whole car would then blow the cold air as it dropped down. So, now we're heading into the armoured part of the car where the President stayed. Here, we have the dining room. All the rooms in the car had a phone in them. When the car was underway, the phones were hooked up to a radio car called the General Myer. And when they were in stations, they were hot-wired into the phones in the station. This is the desk the President would use, he could sign papers. This is what the windows look like. This is 12-ply, laminated glass, about three inches thick, so all the windows from this point to the rear of the car are sealed, you cannot take them out, which is why they have air-conditioning. Stateroom C here, this is the President's quarters. The President has a fixed bed, giving him a little bit of extra leg room. That is what a commode chair looks like. The back folds down as a sink and the seat folds up to be a toilet underneath. The wheelchair was built specifically for Roosevelt's use in this car, so he could get up and down the narrow hallway. Here we have the Presidential bathroom, and the first of the two escape hatches are here. What would have been a window has been converted to a steel plate that they could push out and they could get the President out that way if they needed to. What looks like a soap dish hanging by the door here, is actually a cigar holder. Roosevelt would sit in there and smoke cigars. Here we have the observation lounge of the car. This is where Presidents would sit in the back of the car and watch the rails pass behind them, entertain their guests that were on the car with them. We also have the second escape hatch. This was fashioned from a submarine. It was designed if the car was ever knocked over on its side, they could open this door and go out it. This door leads to the rear platform. The door alone weighs 1500 pounds. That's about half the weight of the car that most people come to visit our museum in. It was fashioned after a bank vault. Out here is the rear platform. This is where Presidents would give their speeches. When Truman ascended to the presidency, after Roosevelt died, he pretty much lived in this car for a few months as he did a run across the campaign trail, and he made more than 350 whistle-stop speeches from this back platform. That's what allowed him to connect with the American people. Of course, air travel became easier and cheaper and safer and eventually the Ferdinand Magellan fell out of use. Nowadays it's a museum piece, but in an era where the ""Trump Train"" is just a metaphor, it's interesting to note that there were other Presidents whose train was... a little more real. America as a country, except for certain parts of the country, doesn't embrace rails the way that we used to. This piece is historic, it is unique, it is hearkening back to a simpler place and time, and a simpler pace of life. And that's what I wish we could kinda... get a little piece of that back. Still keep our cell phones, I'm not giving that up(!) Thank you to everyone at the Gold Coast Railway Museum. Pull down the description for more about them and about the Ferdinand Magellan."
285,There's a mermaid show in Florida,"This is not an artificial swimming pool, and it's not filled with chlorinated, treated water. This is a natural spring in Weeki Wachee, Florida. And it's at the top of a massive system of caverns, where the Weeki Wachee River surfaces. Hundreds of millions of litres of water forcing its way out the ground every day. But while the spring might be natural, what's going on under the surface definitely isn't. It's created by humans, because for more than 70 years, there's been a mermaid show here. Toughest part of the job, I definitely think, is training. Took me about six months to swim my first show. Once you get hired, you get scuba certified and then you can start on the hose, which -that's the process that takes the longest. Learning how to breathe and be comfortable down there. It takes a lot of breath control and building your lungs. Teaching your lungs and stretching them and getting them used to holding the air. The longest we hold our breath here is the Ferris wheel. That's when we hold each other and we spin around. The water is 74.2Â° year-round. It's very cold being in there. We have approximately 20-25 young women on staff who perform as mermaids. We also have about three or four gentlemen that play the role of the prince in our version of The Little Mermaid. This place is the work of a man called Newt Perry, world class swimmer and swimming coach, former diver for the U.S. Navy, and consultant to Hollywood. He looked at this spring and thought, ""I could put a show on in there"". The first theatre had 18 seats, but by the sixties, the ABC television network had bought the place, and built a theatre for 400. And it was selling out. Well, 117 million gallons of water coming from a very tiny opening at the bottom of the spring on a daily basis will provide a current, and it's about a 5mph current. They're not swimming in a tank. There's so many different species of wildlife that inhabit a Florida river, we get 'em all. Turtles, otters, the manatees are always a favourite. The turtles love to get in the way, and they'll follow your tail around. We don't really have snakes come that often. Every once in a while, blue moon. And then sometimes we'll get alligators. If they're in a range that's too close, we'll get out of the water. In the 60s, Weeki Wachee was a spectacular, world-famous tourist attraction. But by the 90s, the consensus was that is was a relic. Dated and down on its luck, at least compared to the shiny new theme parks that Disney and Universal were opening over in Orlando. In 2003, the New York Times called this place ""aging"" and ""faded"". But it turns out that once something gets old enough, with the right marketing, ""outdated"" can become ""retro"". ""Historic"". Weeki Wachee Springs was a private company all the way up until 2008, when the state of Florida, in an effort to help save it, acquired the attraction. And not only did they acquire it for the natural resource that we have here, the spring, the scrub habitat that surrounds the spring, but also because of the cultural significance of what the mermaids have meant to Florida tourism for seven decades now. Weeki Watchee is never going to be on same level as Walt Disney World. It couldn't be. But the same day I'm here, the Florida state tourist board have sent a crew to film. The last audition call for mermaids here made the news around the world, and the articles are sounding a lot more positive than they did 15 years ago. In the 21st century, Weeki Wachee is becoming a bit of living history. History that still has three shows a day. Being a mermaid is the best job anyone could ask for. My favourite part of the job is dealing with the kids and making a difference in the community. We do a lot of dealing with Make-A-Wish programmes, and these kids think that you're really a mermaid and they think that everything you're doing is so magical. Just making such a difference in their lives, just by coming to work, we're pretty lucky that we can do that. Thanks to all the team at Weeki Wachee Springs State Park. You can find out more about them at the links in the description."
286,This city centre has no street names,"I like finding exceptions to rules. The sort of things that expose assumptions about how we think the world works, and that confuse any computer system that isn't set up to accept them. Like: streets have names, right? Okay, sure, there are some people out there who'll immediately go, ah, no, see, there are lots of streets that don't have names, in rural areas and the developing world, or there are the roads that just have a number or a letter. And some of you will go, oh, well, actually, Japan. Most of Japan doesn't name its streets, it names and numbers its city blocks, and besides it's more complicated than that... But, okay. In a Western European nation like Germany, in the centre of a large city like Mannheim, you'd expect there to be street names. Nah. Welcome to the exception to the rule. Here inside the Quadrates of Mannheim, the Squares of the town centre, only a few major streets have names. Every other building is referred to by which square it's on, as part of a grid. The west half gets the letters A-K; the east half, L-U, and that's followed by the number of blocks from the centre. So you can have C4, or in German ""ð®ð"" [see-fear], which explains why the art gallery on it is called Zephyr. Given the German reputation for humour, that's a pretty good multilingual pun. None of the modern mapping companies know what to do with this. They'd be fine if the whole country ran on a different system, but mixing and matching in the same area, in a region that, as far as most people know, just doesn't do this... well, they can't cope. Google and Microsoft get confused and give each road multiple names. Apple insist that each road just has one name, and they're entirely wrong, although it's Apple Maps, so, you know(!) OpenStreetMap, which is community-led, recognises full addresses but not the individual blocks, although presumably that'll be fixed within a few hours of this video being uploaded. This isn't some modern invention, either. This isn't something brought on by future-looking city planners rebuilding after the Second World War, or 80s planners getting ahead of themselves. While the numbering patterns have changed over the years, this bit of Mannheim has had some form of block numbering for a long, long time. Why change it just because some programmers can't figure out how to put it into their database? The programmers have only been around for a few years. This city has been around for centuries. The address of a place here in the Quadrates really is just a number, then a block, Mannheim, Germany. Even if some computers don't believe it."
287,Remote controlling an entire airport,"Behind me is London City Airport, built on an old dock in East London. They're building a new control tower here, to replace the 30-year-old one and to make room for expansion. But that new tower won't have any people in it. It'll just be a tall mast with a lot of cameras. The people will be 80 miles away. We're in at the London City ops room,  which will go live in January 2020. And this is where London City air traffic control will be provided from. London City does not have a lot of space. So the footprint that's taken up by this mast is significantly less than it would be for the traditional tower. The digital tower can be cheaper. It's significantly easier to build. You don't have to have any of the functionality that you need for people to be in there. So, there are no restrooms, kitchens, toilets. Using the augmentation on the screen, we can actually show them the aircraft as they're flying by the window, with their radar tags on it. So they can see the callsign, the speed, and altitude. We also have the pan-tilt-zoom cameras. In theory you can look into the sun to track an aircraft who's travelling to the south. You'd never do that with binoculars, but this system lets you do that. This is a 360 panorama, but it's compressed into 225 degrees. The benefit for the controller is that they no longer need to look over their shoulder to see anything that's passing behind. You know aircrafts 13 miles, 15 miles on approach, they can see the lights. So the visibility this gives you is much better than the human eye. The data is compressed at site and then it's squirted down a couple of really big pipes down to Swanwick. We specify that lag as being less than one second, which is the same lag that we have for voice communications with pilots. Right now, that new control room is just used for training. The camera mast isn't built yet so they're just using footage filmed from a crane a few months ago. Digital control towers are already used at smaller airports. But this will be the first one in a major city with this level of air traffic. Something like this just doesn't have to fail safe, it has to add no additional risk. Every controller is quite conservative by nature. So they have a little what-if in the back of their head. What if a screen fails, what if a feed fails, what if a camera fails? All these things we've put into the design. On top of each of the screens is a little ""stay-alive indicator"", so if it's a quiet time of the day and there might not be any traffic moving about, you know that you're still looking at the airport, you know you're not looking at a frozen picture of the airport. If you lose a screen, the system is clever enough to recognise that the screen has failed, it will then transmit that image onto a spare screen, reshuffle all the images to actually give the controller the appropriate view, and then engineers can arrive and change given five or ten minutes. If a camera fails, we have got the pan-tilt-zoom cameras on the top of the housing which can actually replicate the view of the camera that's failed. If it rains, there's compressed air that automatically blows the rain away. There's bird protection on top, and you've also got some heaters inside so it doesn't get misty or frosty in the winter. If the cameras, in their entirety, fail, we effectively manage the transition as if it was fog. We still have a number of backup routes. We have separate voice communications to the airport which are unaffected. Controllers can't see in fog, you lose the cameras, you can't see and we just slowly manage that transition to the same type of operation. We are using separate data feeds. They come from the masts, one goes east, one goes west. They're not public internet, they don't go into the cloud. They don't go through the same ducts. They are robust and secure. Now, I don't want this to sound like a sponsored video. It isn't. But having visited the new control centre, yeah, in the rational part of my brain, I'm convinced that it works and it's safe. Given the augmented reality overlays and the extra height, it might well be more safe than the old tower. But, it still feels a bit wrong, and I don't have a sensible reason why. There are plenty of times that ""it just feels wrong"" can be a good reason to avoid something. Bad relationships, walking down a dark street at night; your brain is good at avoiding things that might hurt you. But air travel, something so far outside everyday experience where safety is so important, that can't be governed by whether something feels right. Here, the evidence is pretty solid. And if I'm on a flight out of here in 2020, I'll give the cameras a wave as I take off. Tell me we got that!"
288,The German town that's literally cracking apart,"This is the town of Staufen, near the Black Forest in south-west Germany. And as you walk around, it looks like a normal German town with one strange addition. Up on some buildings, there is a big fake piece of sticky tape with a slogan that translates as ""Staufen must not fall apart"". Unfortunately, it's a bit late for that. The government here tried to bore for geothermic energy and they bored, in total,  seven boreholes right behind the town hall. Underneath of Staufen is a big layer of anhydrite and underneath that is a layer of groundwater in a confined aquifer. The pressurised groundwater went into the layer of anhydrite and formed gypsum which expands by about 50%. Unfortunately, that means that the ground  is expanding, bulging up, and forming cracks in almost every single house that's standing here. It took two weeks for the first cracks to appear. In the decades since the drilling operation the town hall has risen more than half a metre and moved sideways by about the same amount. And that might not sound like much, and yes, if everything had shifted evenly it might not even be a problem. The trouble is that different parts of each building have shifted by slightly different amounts. Modern buildings couldn't cope with that, and that town hall was built in 1546. The result is cracking. There's water from this confined aquifer that's pushing up the boreholes. And what they are trying to do is get the water out, get the pressure down from the confined aquifer so that it doesn't even want to go up those holes anymore. So they are pumping at a speed of around a litre per second. The swelling started with about a centimetre per month, now it's down to about a millimetre per month. But it's still swelling, and even a millimetre  is still way too much for every house. Theoretically, they can stop it, but you cannot just plug it like a bathtub. It's not a single plane. It's more three dimensional, so in reality you would need a big, big plug and you don't even know where it exactly is. The drilling company settled out of court for more than â¬1m, but the cost of the damage here is estimated at more than 50 times that. And there are eight other German towns with similar problems. Geothermal drilling was popular and not massively regulated. And while the industry and the country have learned from those mistakes, for this town that knowledge comes a little too late. Thank you very much to Constantijn Crijnen, he suggested this video in the first place. He also has his own YouTube channel where he's building a 3D printer from scratch, go check him out."
289,The Lava Lamps That Help Keep The Internet Secure,"Computers aren't very good at picking random numbers. Every part of a computer is designed to be predictable, and to follow logical patterns. You put the same numbers in, you're going to get the same numbers out. Which is a problem, because all modern encryption, including that padlock up in your browser that tells you that you're safe, all of that relies on big, properly random numbers. If you can somehow predict those numbers, you can start breaking those locks. Which is why I'm here, at the headquarters of Cloudflare, in San Francisco. Cloudflare is a service that protects websites and web services, and sort of sits in front of them as a gatekeeper. Somewhere around 10% of the web flows through Cloudflare's network. Cloudflare was one of the first companies to provide free SSL encryption for websites. So the connection between your web browser and the website you're going to is fully encrypted and invisible for eavesdroppers to be able to look at. In short, these folks deal with a lot of encrypted Internet traffic, so they need a lot of random numbers. It is possible to write code that will simulate randomness, and that's good enough for a lot of uses, but in theory, those numbers could be predicted. They're just being generated by code, so the servers here have to get their randomness from an external and entirely unpredictable source. A lot of home computers treat their own users as sources of randomness, tiny twitches of mouse movement, the exact milliseconds between keystrokes, or on a phone maybe even the accelerometer or other sensors. In all those cases, they generally discard the bigger parts, the bits that could just be influenced by humans, and go off the tiny little decimal places, the bits that you couldn't control precisely, even if you wanted to. But that sort of human interaction is nowhere near enough for an operation on this scale, hence lava lamps. We videotape these lava lamps and take the pictures and video, and turn it into a stream of random, unpredictable bytes. And this unpredictable data is what we use to help create the keys that encrypt the traffic that flows through Cloudflare's network. This data is then fed into our data centres and then fed into the Linux kernel which then uses it to help seed random number generators that are used to generate keys. Every time that you take a picture with a camera there's going to be some sort of static, some sort of noise. So it's not only just where the bubbles are flowing through the lava lamp, it's the state of the air, the ambient light, every tiny change impacts the stream of data. A cryptographic hash function is something that we use where even if you have one static image and one little bit changes, it changes the entire stream. So we use that to help scatter the randomness as much as possible. We also collect randomness around the world. So in our London office, we have this thing called a chaotic pendulum. It has three pieces and it's unpredictable in which way they twist and turn together. We videotape that and feed it into our randomness source, as well. In our Singapore office, we have a radioactive source that we use to feed into the randomness system, as well. So this is not just some stunt that we pulled, it's actually being fed into our real systems. Whether anything in the world is truly random is arguably a question of philosophy and not science. Maybe everything is just complicated clockwork. But these lava lamps are so chaotic that simulating that camera shot with perfect pixel accuracy, far enough ahead to be useful while figuring out everything else those images are being put through, it's roughly the same level of difficulty as just brute-forcing the encryption in the first place. And even if you could simulate all that, you'd only have one piece of the puzzle. These folks aren't the first to do this. ""Lavarand"" was patented by a company called Silicon Graphics in 1996, but that only lasted a couple of years. Now of course, there are less flashy and more practical ways to generate random numbers, but then I wouldn't be here. I would be at some other company who'd gone and, I don't know, pointed a camera at a basket of kittens. That'd be a bit higher maintenance, though."
290,The Story of Salvation Mountain,"You might have seen Salvation Mountain in music videos or in documentaries. It attracts people. Even for folks who aren't religious, this hill, covered in half a million gallons of latex paint and sitting in the middle of the sun blasted California desert, this hill has something about it. And it was the work of just one person. Leonard Knight was a man who, he was kinda lost, just cruising around trying to figure out what to do. He discovered Jesus, so he had a mission, and then he started doing things. and he made a hot air balloon, like 200 foot, sewed it all together with all these praises to God on it. Brought it out here. The desert ended up taking its toll on the balloon, but he stayed and he built this mountain. But you really have to look at it to get the big picture. That sand hill, that way, shows exactly what was here. Couple little straggly bushes and a flat hill of sand. And Leonard built all this. He added extra clay, hay bales, whatever it took to build this all up. He just kept goin' and goin'. He was going to dome the whole thing off. And he never really thought of himself as a artist, he more thought of himself as somebody just doing what he was doing. He was a persistent dude. This mountain originally fell after three and a half years of building. He rebuilt. He had a passion, and this is so beautiful. 28 years of dedication. Try dedicating 28 minutes to something nowadays, realistically. I think about that. Leonard Knight had no training, no collective of other folks around him. The technical term is outsider art. He wasn't inspired by anyone else's work, unless you count God. He wasn't imitating great artists, he wasn't asking for feedback from friends around him, he just created this, and it resonated with the world. Years after his death, there's a group of people here who give their time preserving his legacy. We have so many people coming from everywhere. I've met people from little countries in Africa, to all over Europe, to floating little islands and this and that, it's amazing. And some people, they come here for the religional deals on it, cool. Some people come here for pretty people takin' pretty pictures at a pretty place, which-be respectful, and that's cool too. It's getting you out, you're doing stuff. They're getting off their couches and getting away from the TVs and stuff, which is... TV is awesome too, though, so I'm not knocking TV. Paint donations that we get here, most of them come from the visitors. They'll bring a couple of cans, couple of cans turn into a hundred cans. Let's say I wanted to paint that heart. I would have to wait a considerable amount of time 'til I had enough really beautiful red to mix up to paint that heart. And then it makes it so much more satisfying when you do do it. But the best thing is, that our paint comes really from the heart, from the people. Even if this were to fall apart, it's inspired so many people, filmmakers, pilgrims, and tourists alike, that it'll live on in memories, in photographs, and yes, in music videos. The moment I knew about it, I wanted to come here and see it for myself. I started volunteering here because I realised how important it was to everybody that came here. And so I volunteered more, and eventually they had me be like a greeter and I would, ""Da-de-dah-de-dah."" Then I was like, ""Well, can I paint while I greet?"" ""Oh yeah, go ahead."" ""Da-de-dah-de-dah."" Next thing you know I'm the caretaker and I've been living here a year and a half. In my heart I'm the preservationist of this place. I've tried to paint it all the same and make it beautiful and keep it. When I fix it, I fix it good. If I can't fix it good, don't fix it yet, leave it alone. Leave it alone 'til you can do it right. The biggest thing is: this is about love. Leonard's love was God, and his relationship with Jesus. But all kinds of love is awesome. Like these people all just love cruising around and hanging out, doing stuff. That's all makes everything better. We don't think about all the dumb crap in this world. And you know what? Then the dumb crap in this world really becomes dumb crap in this world and it doesn't have a powerful voice. There's not many places in this world where it's good, and nothing's expected of you. We hope you would donate money to us 'cause that's how we do it, but if you don't, cool! We got free souvenirs anyway, and there's constantly stuff going on. But if you show up on a Saturday, you'll get to see what this is really about. It is just packed with people having a good time, respecting the mountain, respecting each other, it's awesome! Some folks would say it's divine inspiration. Some folks would be a bit more cynical and say that it had to be someone. Of all the millions, perhaps billions of people who ever tried creating art with no experience and no training, yes, statistically someone was going hit the jackpot. But it's difficult to be cynical here. So I brought a couple of cans of paint along as part of my own pilgrimage, because as it turns out, I want to help preserve this as well."
291,Why California's musical road sounds terrible,"If you drive down a certain stretch of highway in the California desert, you will hear music. It's supposed to sound a little bit like this: [William Tell Overture, by Rossini] but instead, it sounds like this. [William Tell Overture, by Rossini, but badly out of tune] That was the musical road of Lancaster, California. And as you may have heard, it's a little bit out of tune. A lot of money was spent on that road. It was a publicity stunt for a car company who wanted to show off how clever they are. And doing the calculations for something like that isn't really difficult. A musical note is a vibration in the air at a particular frequency. And those vibrations can be made by a violin string or synthesised by a computer or in this case made by vehicle tyres hitting grooves in the road. The closer the grooves are, the faster the vibrations, and the higher the note. So take the speed limit, divide by the frequency of the note you want, and that's how often there should be a groove in the road. And if people travel at the wrong speed, well, it shouldn't really matter. It'll just be like slowing down or speeding up any other piece of music: it'll be in the wrong key, but it'll still sound right to most people's ears. It won't sound like that mess. So what went wrong? At this point, I am indebted to David Simmons-Duffin, an assistant professor of physics at Caltech, whose interests include Quantum Field Theories and playing baroque violin. Because he was, as far as I can tell, the very first person to figure out what went wrong: and the problem was probably the English language. Whoever did the calculations said that the grooves should be so far apart. Let's say, four inches for the first note. And they meant there should be a groove every four inches. But whoever gave the instructions to the work crew said that the grooves should be ""four inches apart"". And that was interpreted as four inches between the end of one groove and the start of the next one. They didn't include the width of the groove itself. But your ears definitely do include it. The highest note on that section of the William Tell Overture should be one octave higher than the lowest. That means the frequency should be doubled, and that the grooves should be half the distance apart. And they are: if you don't include the width of the groove itself. That error means that every note is distorted not by a fraction of its value, like if you're travelling at the wrong speed, but by a constant amount: by the width of the grooves. The higher the note, the greater the effect of that distortion. And the result is the mess that you are about to hear for a second time. And the really strange part? This is the second musical road built in Lancaster, California. The first one, built by the car company, was too close to residents, who complained about the constant noise. And probably this note here. So the city paved over it and rebuilt it... to the exact, same, wrong blueprints. That's a take. That is a take. Right there. And in order to celebrate that take, I am going to put my foot down. This is an SUV. It doesn't, er... it doesn't do that."
292,Reaction ferries are really clever,"I'm in Basel, in Switzerland. The river Rhine runs through here, and if you want to get across it, then there are four ferries. I mean, there are bridges as well, but the ferries keep going as a tourist attraction, as tradition, and for some folks, an actual way to get where you want to go. Also occasionally a fondue restaurant, because Switzerland. But these ferries have no paddles, no oars, no engines, nothing on board to power them. Put them in the open ocean or a lake and they'd just drift. And yet here, they move. So here's how they work: there is a wire strung across the river and the ferry is connected to it. There's a little thing called a traveler that goes back and forth smoothly. The ferry does have a rudder for steering, so when it's time to cross, the captain angles the boat against the current, and uses the force of the river itself to push the boat across. Without that cable, it'd drift downstream, fast. But since it can't, it just crosses the river instead. No gasoline, no human effort, just the force of the river. Boats like this are called reaction ferries, and there are examples all over the world. Sometimes the design's a little different, but the principle is always the same. I only learned about them a few weeks ago, and in hindsight, they seem incredibly obvious. You have an object that needs energy sitting on top of a massive, constant energy source just waiting to be harnessed. But if you'd asked me how to connect those two things before I knew the answer, then my first thought would probably have been some overcomplicated, overengineered plan like putting a waterwheel on the side of the river and then using that cable to send power to an electric motor on the boat. I mean, there is a hydroelectric dam not far away. I'd like to think that I'd have worked it out eventually, but I'd have probably missed the easy option to start with. To anyone who grew up in a place with these ferries, it's a really obvious idea. But to everyone else, it's an invention we've never thought of. To be fair, this is only a good solution in a few places. You need a strong, fast, steady river, like the Rhine, at a place where it isn't tidal, and where it isn't particularly seasonal either. But if I've missed that, then the obvious follow-up question is, well: what else have I missed? And is there anything out there that every single human has missed? Maybe there is still some big, obvious-in-hindsight stuff out there that'll change the world... just as soon as someone thinks of it."
293,The rotary jail had a slight problem,"In 1881 an architect called William Brown and an iron foundry owner called Benjamin Haugh patented an idea for a new type of jail. The Rotary Jail. In hindsight, it was not a good idea It's impractical, unsafe, and massively overcomplicated. But that didn't stop them selling the idea to a few towns across the United States. And the first one was built here, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. And while it hasn't held prisoners for decades, it is the only one where the mechanism still works. We have a two story rotary jail, and there are eight cells on each floor. It weighs approximately 30 tonnes, it's made of steel. It's operated by a hand crank, the hand crank moves both floors of the jail at exactly the same time. It doesn't touch any of the walls, it doesn't touch the bars the whole machine sits around a central cylinder that runs from the roof to the sewer system. And it works like a pin, all of the weight of it rests on the lip on top of that pin. It's just a marvel of engineering for its time. The advantage of having a rotational cell block was that you could have just the one opening, the inmates could enter/exit their cells from in front of a pie shaped cell block. So if you only had one door to watch, then you didn't have to pay as many guards to be here to watch the inmates. There's just one way out. The half-moon seat shapes are toilets, they've been welded shut. So when our jail was built in the 1880s our inmates had indoor plumbing and toilets inside their cells when most of the country didn't have it in their homes. But some of the issues with the jail are that from 1882 until 1938 there was just one opening on each floor. And there's an independently operating sliding door that locks closed on each floor to keep inmates just from jumping out whenever they want to. If there was a fire, you risked having to have a guard stand there and crank out each cell one by one to get the inmates to safety. The other issue is that almost 50% of our inmates were arrested for being drunk, some of them would over spill from the drunk tank and need to be in the cells to make room for other inmates as they came in. So they would fall asleep on the ground, hugging the bars and the machine would begin to move, and essentially the wall would come into contact with their limbs and break them or amputate them. They quit rotating the jail in 1938, they cut an individual door out of every cell and they installed the catwalk. So they quit rotating it because the problems that they had with fire concerns and with inmates getting limbs chopped off. As far as we've been told, as long as we keep maintenancing the machine the way that we do and treating it the way that we do, there's no end in sight. We'll be able to turn it forever. There are any number of ways that this could have been improved. The bars could have spun, not the cells. or you could remove the complicated, expensive rotation part entirely, and just, you know, open one cell at a time. Which is basically a regular jail. The moral of the story? Just because an idea has been patented doesn't mean that it's actually any good. Just means no one's thought of it before and sometimes there's a reason for that."
294,A nuclear waste dump you can walk on,"I'm in Weldon Spring, near St Louis, Missouri, USA, and in the 1950s and 60s, this strange, grey, wind-blasted hill wasn't here: instead, there was a uranium processing factory. And conditions for the workers back then were shocking by today's standards. It wasn't quite the 1940s, you can find testimony from back then of workers hand-scooping uranium ore, but there are tales of spilled radioactive powder, of overflowing disposal pits, and of strange-looking frogs. And I am not making that up. When the factory here was running, it was known as ""The Clean One"". And, well, it wasn't. The plant here closed in 1966, as the most contaminated site in the area: PCBs, mercury, asbestos, and radioactive waste. In the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency declared Weldon Spring a Superfund Site, meaning it would finally be cleaned up. And the result is this: a seven-storey high nuclear waste dump, the permanent disposal cell, containing more than a million cubic metres of toxic waste, and hopefully keeping the local residents safe for the next 1,000 years or so. And that was going to be pretty much all of the video. If you search this place online, that's as far as a lot of articles go. Except. Then I did a bit more research. And I found out about Coldwater Creek, a few miles away, where radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project, the project that built the first nuclear bombs, the waste was just dumped there in the 1940s, with the government's approval. That waste eventually flowed, decades later, into people's backyards after flooding. That was in 2015. Then there's the West Lake Landfill, on the other side of St Louis, where an underground trash fire has been burning very close to another radioactive waste site for seven years. Now, the risk is apparently minor. No-one is about to find a glowing barrel in their backyard. But radiation hazards are invisible and terrifying: local residents are concerned about clusters of cancer diagnoses, about infant mortality caused by contaminated groundwater. There are wells for drinking water only a mile away. The state department of health investigated and their results set no-one's mind at ease. There are so many confounding factors that the facts are, well, somewhere between confusing and unknown, and people are scared. This site is a legacy of a time when the people in charge didn't know, or didn't care, about the risks of radioactive contamination. But this isn't a monument to how we've fixed their mistakes: it's a reminder that we're still fixing them, and that we'll still need to for centuries or millennia to come."
295,An elevator that actually goes sideways,"In June 2015, I went to Sheffield, and I saw a paternoster lift, an obsolete design of elevator with a looping chain of open cabs. In June 2016, I travelled to Genoa in Italy, and I saw an elevator that also moved sideways. Except, spoiler, it's a bit of a cheat, it's actually a little horizontal car that moves inside a bigger elevator that does the heavy lifting. And now, it is June 2017. And I'm in Germany, at the brand-new Thyssenkrupp Elevator Test Tower, and they have flown me out here to show off Multi: their actual, full-size, working elevator that moves sideways without cheating. For us, it was very important to have a tower to test the new technology. We don't want to test it at the customers' site. The tower is 246m high, and this means 1,700 steps. I know that exactly, because I walked up once! This is a building made almost entirely of elevator shafts. Some of them test regular lifts, but some of them are reserved for this new system. The principle of having a continuous rotating flow of cars was one of the best inventions in our industry ever. And to achieve this, we have to exchange cabins from one shaft to another. And to have this exchange, we need an exchanger, which you see just behind me. And this exchanger allows us to go into horizontal movement. The exchanger can be placed at every point in the shaft so it allows us to do all kinds of configurations. Coming down vertically, and then going into the horizontal movement. One of the problems with elevators in really tall buildings is that you need a cable so long that it can't support its own weight, let alone the weight of the cab that's then connected to it. The solution here is a bit different, and it doesn't use cables at all. It uses linear induction motors. Linear drive it's also a synchronous motor with permanent magnets. And you maybe know it from a rotating motor. If we just take this motor and cut it on one side and just lay it on a table flat, then you already have a linear drive. And this is what we have, vertical and also horizontal. In a regular elevator, it's called a traction elevator, you've got cables holding the cab, any one of which can hold more than the design weight. Also, you've got emergency brakes which will pop out and slow the car down with friction if it's moving too fast. And, absolute worst case, even if all that somehow fails, you have a buffer at the bottom that should reduce a freefall drop from ""fatal"" to just ""severe injuries""(!) Elevators are incredibly safe because they're incredibly well-regulated. So before this is allowed to carry humans, this system needs to be at least as failsafe. The safety is not just in the ropes of a conventional elevator but in the brake system. In conventional elevators, you have the brake on the machine on top of the shaft in the machine room now we have the brake directly on the cars. This new component, the exchanger, where we go from vertical into horizontal movement, also needs to be checked by our safety controller. What is the position of the exchanger? Is it locked? Is it safe? And in case of any violation of a safety rule, then we go to a 'safe state'. There are, of course, some catches. Linear induction motors are expensive and heavy. Each one of the cabs needs to have its own set. And the whole elevator shaft, from top to bottom, needs to be lined with the magnetic coil units that power them. To save weight, these cabs are made of carbon fibre and aluminium. So will it work out in the real world? Thyssenkrupp's models say it will, but everything's been tested and approved here, the next step is to sell it. To the kind of enormous multinational companies who build skyscrapers and who do not like risk. And that might be a greater challenge than making the elevators in the first place. Thank you very much to all the team at Thyssenkrupp who've invited me over here. You can pull down the description for more about Multi."
296,The Museum of Failure,"I'm in Helsingborg, in Sweden, to film a museum. And normally I don't travel just to film museums, because most museums -science, natural history -are pretty much the same the world over. But this museum is not only interesting, it's also unique. Welcome to the Museum of Failure. 80-90% of all innovation projects fail. Everybody in the business knows this. And where are these failures? Companies sweep them under the carpet and pretend they don't exist. The Museum of Failure takes these failed products, puts them on display, so that everybody can learn from them. The criteria that a product has to meet to be here is: that it was an innovation, and that it was a failure. and the failure is a deviation from expected, desired outcomes. (I didn't know Apple even had a gaming console!) No, this is their hidden, dark secret(!) This one was supposed to measure the EEG of a dog's brain and then translate those mental states into human voice. Of course, utter nonsense. It's completely impossible. I've gotten one legal threat from New York. We're in Sweden, you can't sue me(!) Kultur Hotellet, that runs this gallery space, are generously allowing us to be here for three or four months. This space isn't permanent, but the Museum is permanent in downtown Helsingborg. I'd say about a third of the stuff I've bought on eBay, the other third I've gotten on specialty forums. Some of them have been donated, which is great. Some of them just come by my office, and say ""I want to give you this"", you know? One of them was a Palm Pilot: I took it, but I can't put it on display because the Palm Pilot was a success. Two of these items I've bought in dark alleys paying cash only. Can't tell you which ones they are(!) All of which leads to one fairly obvious question: What happens if the Museum of Failure... fails? One serious concern that I do have is: when a product is overhyped, and then when it's launched, it doesn't meet those expectations, then there's a big risk of failure. So I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous that the Museum of Failure would flop! It would have to be on display at its own museum, so... The Museum of Failure is like one of these perpetual, everlasting machines. It can never fail(!) Thank you very much to Samuel West and all the team at the Museum of Failure."
297,The poison garden of Alnwick,"Sometimes I go to a place and I tell stories. But occasionally, I go somewhere and find not just stories but a really good storyteller. In the grounds of Alnwick Castle, in the north of England, is Alnwick Garden. Itâs not quite as old as the castle, thatâs been here about 900 years or so, but it is just as impressive. Inside is one of the worldâs largest wooden treehouses, beautiful water features and also... this. The slightly less conventional Alnwick Poison Garden. Welcome to the Poison Garden. All the plants in here have the ability to kill you, so youâre not allowed to touch or smell or stand too close to them. This is Ricinus communis and you can see that it has very architectural leaves, but the issue with it is that you can, under laboratory environments, take out ricin. Ricin is the deadliest poison known to man. Here we have Atropa belladonna, deadly nightshade, a native plant to the UK. These flowers that you can see here will produce a black grape-like berry. Four of those berries are enough to kill a child. Very toxic indeed. In Italy, especially around Venice, the ladies used to squeeze the berries to get the juice and then use the juice to put in their eyes to dilate their pupils to make them look more attractive to gentlemen. Because itâs toxic, slowly you start to lose your vision. What you do for vanity. Ruta graveolens, again, a very common plant that you can actually buy from garden centres, yet it is phototoxic which means that if you get the sap onto your hands, then in bright sunlight your skin will start to blister. Once that chemical is in your system, it will stay in that system for up to seven years. Now, we had a senior gardener who came into the Poison Garden and happened to see a weed growing out of this plant, so without putting her gloves on she took the weed out. Within an hour, she started to form blisters on her hand and she ended up with third degree burns. This plant is called Aconitum napellus. Itâs very common. Itâs often called monkshood. The whole of the plant is very toxic. Two years ago, there was a head gardener down in Surrey who unfortunately was working with this plant and he died a few days later, and they put that down to the toxins from the plant. Here we have a very common plant again. This is laurel, used often as hedging. The issue with laurel is that it will produce cyanide and in fact, Victorians used to use leaves of these plants. Cut in two, popped in a jam-jar with the butterflies that theyâd captured, screw on the lid and the butterfly would die naturally because of the cyanide poisoning. Now, this plant you can buy from garden centres, a very common pot plant, itâs called Brugmansia and the whole of the plant is toxic. Itâs often called the Angelâs Trumpet. Itâs an hallucinogenic plant so you can use it in all sorts of ways. In fact, Victorian ladies would grow the Brugmansia on their tea tables and then invite ladies around for afternoon tea. What they would then do is in the tea pot, shake some of the pollen which would go into the tea and then the ladies would to start to loosen their tongue slightly and talk about all sorts of nonsense. We have a licence from the Home Office to grow cannabis. So we have it here in a cage. Obviously, itâs a Class C drug. We use this plant to start to introduce to children all about the harmful effects of drugs. This is Henbane. It produces very peculiar flowers that give off a very pungent scent. The scent is so strong that often here we get people collapsing, thatâs why weâve got the bench next to the wall. Mandragora, or Mandrake as itâs commonly known, a very popular plant now because of the Harry Potter phenomenon. The whole of the plant is poisonous. Historically, people used to think that there was a live little man underneath the plant, because if you dug the plant up, the actual tap root would often have two little legs and a little arm and so people imagined that it was the devil himself. Often people said they could hear the plant screaming as it was pulled up, and so a lot of myth and legend grew up around the Mandrake. The Duchess of Northumberland is the inspiration of the whole of this garden. When she became Duchess, she had a vision to create a modern, contemporary garden that would educate visitors. So the Duchess then realised: children especially donât want to listen to talks on herb gardens because they switch off. If you can tell them that the plants are actually poisonous and have the ability to kill you, then you have the imagination of that child. Thank you very much to all the team at Alnwick Garden, and to Trevor in particular! If you want to know more about the gardens or the castle, pull down the description."
298,The world's most powerful tidal current,"Most of us don't think much about the ocean's tides. Tide goes in, tide goes out. It's just some water moving because the moon and sun are pulling on it. But those words: ""just some water"" hide an incredible amount of matter, and ""pulling on it"" hides an unimaginable amount of force. And nowhere is that more obvious than right here. I'm just north of the Arctic Circle in Norway, half an hour's drive from a town called BodÃ¸. The land here is mostly what Douglas Adams called 'lovely crinkly edges': and this particular lovely crinkly edge holds the Saltstraumen Maelstrom: the most powerful tidal current on the planet. And the reason it's so powerful: that way is the sea. That way is a fjord, a tidal inlet. Twice a day here, the sea rises and falls by about two metres, so the water level in the fjord tries to equalise. The catch is that pretty much all the water it needs to do that, 400 million cubic metres give or take, has to go through this channel. There are other routes that it could take, but the land masses make those slow and shallow. They're winding country roads whereas this is like a twelve-lane freeway. It's... well, it's a perfect storm. There's a huge mass of water on both sides providing pressure, and the channel starts wide and steadily narrows to the centre both ways. It's the right width, and the right shape, to create this maelstrom of whirlpools and currents and vortices. What surprised me the most, coming here and standing next to it, is how much it changes, moment to moment, second to second, every little twist in the tide and the water creates a new vortex and a new boil. I had to get close enough to stick my camera in on a long pole, and honestly? It terrified me. Tour groups can take an inflatable boat out into the channel, and you'll see occasional fishing vessels taking advantage of all the marine life that gets shunted through here. But unlike the whirpools of myth and legend, this maelstrom isn't going to pull a modern, bouyant, powered boat down to the depths, although a swimmer on their own would be in a lot of trouble, and a large ship might lose control and be dashed against the rocks. But all this force, all this water, this is just a fraction of what's being pulled around out on the ocean. It's just here it's visible, it's on a human scale, it's threatening, so here we pay attention to it."
299,The Beer Pipeline of Bruges,"This is Bruges, in Belgium, famous for chocolate, lace and beer. And this is the Half Moon Brewery. There's been a brewery on this site for somewhere around five centuries. There used to be 30 in the city, but modern production and making enough beer to meet the export demands of the world make that difficult. The Half Moon Brewery moved their bottling operation outside the city years ago, about two miles, but brewing stayed here. This was the last brewery in Bruges. There have been new brewers coming along with new ideas recently, so now we are not the only one any more, but we're definitely the oldest one. Who are we to change the location of this brewery? Logistics are tricky when your entire city centre is a World Heritage Site. Getting ingredients in was tough enough, but having to also bring tanker trucks through narrow cobbled streets, fill them up with beer and then drive them out to the bottling plant two miles away, well, they needed a better solution. So they built one. The beer gets into the pipe right from the brewing room, which is here, and goes from one tank here in the city centre of Bruges to another tank on the other side in the bottling plant. The pipeline's about this size, that's the outer diameter, and inside that one you have four pipes which are approximately 8cm diameter. The beer goes through at the rate of about 5,000-6,000l/hr. It's not such a high flow rate that it's under pressure, it's relatively slow. So it takes a batch of beer about a small hour to get to the other side. The beer enters our site here, it goes in one of the big tanks, the lagering process goes on for three weeks, then the beer has to be filtered, pasteurised, we add sugar and yeast, then everything goes into the bottle. Yeast inside the bottle has to do the second fermentation, and that's happening in a warm room. After the transport, we clean our pipes with cleaning products, we put disinfection inside of the pipe, then we flush it with around 300 litres of water before we put beer into the pipeline again. Outside the city centre, along highways, sure, regular excavators were fine. But here, some more creative approaches were needed. Getting permission for this project wasn't easy, but we were lucky to have some forward-thinking people in our city that agreed with this idea and gave us the permit. It runs only under public domain, so only under the streets, not under houses or private properties, and they actually drill from a distance, so they make a hole on every corner of the street, and then they have a guided drilling whereby they don't need to open up all the streets in order to drill. Four months of construction isn't normally a project that's welcomed, but the locals of Bruges seemed to think that this was something special. The locals initially thought it was a joke, I think. People really took to the idea and actually joked a lot about tapping off the pipeline and getting beer in their own home or kitchen. It wouldn't be possible to connect a pub or even a house along the pipeline, however, that's why we invented the crowdfunding, that's where the idea came from, so people could crowdfund to actually get some beer for life, which was the replacement of having a little beer tap in their own house! Thank you to everyone at the Half Moon Brewery in Bruges. Pull down the description for more about them!"
300,Inside YouTube's Mixed Reality VR Lab,"I can't see any of this. I can't see the mountaintop, or the yawning chasm in front of me, and this isn't some magical drone camera hovering out in mid-air. This is the Mixed Reality Lab at YouTube Space New York, and if I want to see anything around me other than these green walls, I'm going to have to wear this headset. The challenge with virtual reality is that while the person who's in it is amazed, and waving their arms around and experiencing it, the rest of us don't know what's going on. And so mixed reality is a way of letting everyone else see what it would be like if we were there too. We have an actual camera that is filming you in the headset, in front of a green screen, and then the game just needs to know where the virtual camera should be. We're using an HTC Vive for the VR, and if we use a third hand controller and attach that controller to the camera, now the game understands where the camera is and so we can have both the actual camera and the virtual camera moving through the space and recording what it would be like if we were inside there with you. We're using a PC that's specced-out with the highest-end Intel processor, 32 gigs of RAM, and the current high-level consumer video card, which is an NVIDIA GTX 1080. We're rendering at 4K, and anything less than that is going to run into an issue! What's needed to make the mixed reality work is a small config file that sits right in the root folder of the game that you're playing and that config file contains the offset between where that controller sits and where the actual lens of the camera is. And then you also need to match the rotation and the field of view of the camera so other than that, it should work with any recent built of Unity. Unity is a framework for building 3D stuff that a lot of programmers use. And because the system ties into it, the Mixed Reality Lab can work with a lot of different VR games. Not all of them, but a lot. And because the tracking on the HTC Vive is so accurate, we can do things like go in for a close-up on the laser gun that I reckon I'm holding right now. Granted, there's a Vive controller sticking out of the middle of it, but the positioning is pretty much perfect. When you're playing in VR normally, all the computer needs to output is the view that you see in the headset. When we're doing mixed reality, we also output the view as seen from this third controller, this virtual camera. And so what that gives us is four views instead of just the one. The four views are, yes, the headset view as usual, we also see the background, as seen from the perspective of this virtual camera, and then we have two layers of foreground, one of them is the image itself, everything that should appear in front of the player, and then we have just a luma layer to help you key out the black space. The SteamVR plugin automatically selects the foreground and the background based on the position of the headset. And anything that is between the headset and the third controller is foreground and anything that's beyond the headset becomes background. Here in our studio, we're doing a live composite on the fly. And this is a rough idea of what you'll get in your final edit. The live composite is a bit rough around the edges, but you can also take the original assets and do a much more detailed composite in post-production later. Now, virtual studios aren't a new thing. The BBC have been using one for election night for years, although it uses carefully pre-arranged graphics, lots of expensive broadcast-quality equipment, and the host has to rehearse and hit all their marks exactly for things to look right. And let's face it, replace this headset with a Helmet of Justice and you've got 1990s British kids show Knightmare. All those were fancy, custom-built affairs, though: this uses more off-the-shelf components. If you want to do this at home, you're going to need a large, wrap-around green screen, but you could paint your walls! You're going to need a very powerful computer, you'll need a camera that can feed a signal back into your computer, you're going to need a capture card and third controller, but if you have all of those things, you can build a mixed reality setup at home! Thanks to everyone at YouTube Space New York, and the Mixed Reality Lab. You can find out more about them at the links in the description. (Are you going to keep the bump?) (That's actually...!) Yeah, that's nice! All right, that's good! That's a wrap!"
301,Elia: The World's Most Frustrating Work of Art,"I reckon that this dome, here on a windswept field in Denmark, is the world's most frustrating work of art. I know that's a bold claim, so let me explain: this is Elia, designed by an artist called Ingvar Cronhammar. He's famous for dark, industrial art, art that looks like machinery, art that looks alienating and remote. Elia certainly qualifies as all that: it's been here near the town of Herning, in Denmark, since 2001. 32 metres high, if you include those chimneys. The steps up to the viewing gallery are uncomfortably large, it feels like it wasn't designed for humans. Comparisons to an alien spaceship that's landed in the middle of rural Denmark... well, they're clichÃ©, but standing here, they feel about right. Something feels wrong about this sculpture. Which is all very impressive, but that's not the frustrating part. In the middle, just between those four pillars, there is a gas burner, and it shoots a massive flame eight metres in the air, a huge blast of fire. It's one more ominous, unsettling thing about this sculpture: it might burst into flame at any moment. But it probably won't. Because it does that, on average, for just 25 seconds about once every two or three weeks. At random, decided by a computer. It might be months between eruptions. It might just be a few days. And according to an article in the local news, it won't go off if the wind is too high, which is probably is today, or if there are any people too close. Elia's web site doesn't tell you when the flames are going to be, it just archives the time and date of all the ones that you've missed. They keep that up to date just to taunt you, I guess, I don't know. And sure, there are a couple of photos or videos from people online who've been lucky. You can go online and see that. But you can also go online and see the Mona Lisa in much higher resolution than you ever could in person, in incredible detail. That doesn't stop people crowding into the Louvre in Paris to fight with selfie sticks. There is something about being there. So if Elia calls to you, if you want to see the fire in person, you're going to have to camp out and watch it, 24 hours a day, maybe for months. As for me, I've got about an hour left until I have to leave to catch my flight. So here's hoping."
302,The Confusing Borders of Lake Constance,"Behind me is Lake Constance. It is a big lake, near the Alps, in the middle of Europe. This bit of me is in Germany, and this bit of me, on the other side of that sculpture, is in Switzerland. ...they took down the border fence and they replaced it with sculptures. A few miles away behind me, over that horizon, is Austria. And all three countries have a shoreline on Lake Constance. And if you look at a map, you will notice that something is missing: the lines that denote where the international borders, the lines that I'm standing on right now, stop at the lakeshore. Lake Constance is a condominium, which is a fancy way of saying that it belongs to more than one country. But no-one is entirely sure who. We are used to the idea that the Earth is divided up, and different countries own different bits of it. Which is kind of a strange idea when it's put like that, but since most of the world agrees on it, we stick with it. Laws, taxes, rights and responsibilities change at formal, defined lines. Okay, there are international waters, and Antarctica's a special case, and okay, there is that one bit of Africa where two countries both don't want to claim it, but generally: each bit of the world is owned by one particular nation. And sure, sometimes borders get complicated because of treaty glitches or land disputes, but this isn't one of those: it's just that no-one ever bothered to actually put down in an international treaty where the borders are. According to Austria, over there, Lake Constance is a true condominium, shared equally by all three countries all the way across. If you're on the lake, you are simultaneously in Germany, and Austria, and Switzerland. Switzerland is not happy with that: according to them, the border runs straight down the middle of the lake. And Germany is basically like, [shrug]. No-one really has a problem with this. If there are any legal issues, they're settled on a case-by-case basis. So if you're wondering what happens if someone gives birth in the middle of the lake, and what citizenship their kid would have, or what would happen under salvage laws if someone pulls up sunken treasure for the middle of the-I mean, the answer is: [shrug]. We'll sort it out when we have to, and in the meantime no-one's really going to mind. The only people that this lack of defined border does affect are cartographers, map-makers: there is no option on most digital maps for [shrug]. Computers and people don't know where to draw the line."
303,Stopping a Disastrous Plan with Science: the Bay Model,"These days if you want to simulate something in the physical world you use a computer. But what if you couldn't? What if it was, say, the 1950s and you needed to work out if a bold but questionable plan to dam the San Francisco Bay was a good idea? The answer is this: The US Army Corps of Engineers Bay Model. The Bay Model is one and a half acres or more. What you're looking at is one of our former scientific, hydrodynamic, engineering testing facilities. And this was the tool, the instrument, that they used to see what the unforeseen consequences of the John Reber Plan was going to be. In the 1940s and 50s a man named John Reber had a plan to completely change the San Francisco Bay. Enormous dams would create freshwater lakes. There'd be brand-new reclaimed land for industry and for air and naval bases. Reber said it would make the bay a defensible military fortification, move people safely inland and the newly dammed rivers would provide huge amounts of drinking water. Reber was not a professional engineer. He was a theatrical producer who had done a lot of research, but because he worked in showbiz, he knew how to promote something. And by most accounts he was a friendly, sincere, convincing man. So unlike other ideas for giant engineering projects, the Reber Plan actually caught on. Debate went back and forth for years but eventually Reber's plan seemed realistic enough, at least to politicians, that the US Army Corps of Engineers were tasked to see if it was practical and they were given $2.5m, that's about $25m today, to find out. And with it, they built this. This model when it was built was the next level, the next generation. It was extremely accurate as an instrument. At the time there really wasn't anything better. There's 250,000 strategically placed little copper tabs in the bottom of the model to keep the saltwater and the freshwater from going in and out too quickly, but also to duplicate any little protrusions sticking up out of the bottom of the bay. The model is 1:1000 scale horizontally, 1:100 scale vertically and 1:100 scale in time. That means about two hundred times a day, the tide comes in and the tide goes out, because San Francisco Bay has tides and therefore, so does the model. Everything was hand operated for the first thirty years. It took probably anywhere between twelve and fifteen people to operate it, sometimes it was as many as sixty people here at one time working on various different experiments and everybody had to be totally in sync. It was like an orchestra. And the interns were out there in chairs, in lab coats, in the water measuring the various different ebb and flow of the tide. It took three years for Reber's plan to be tested here and in that time Reber passed away. And for his supporters, the results from the model were devastating. It looked great on paper, convinced a lot of people, but when it was tested they found that it was only good on paper. The end result was it failed on ninety-nine different accounts. Wild and unpredictable catastrophic flooding was just one of them. The dams wouldn't create lakes, they'd create evaporation ponds. The tide would create dangerous currents and waves. In short, not only would the Reber Plan have been a disaster, it would have been a billion dollar disaster. The ecosystem would have been devastated too, but it was the 50s, so no-one was really thinking about that. The Corps of Engineers, their job done, figured the model would come in useful again someday. And it did, helping to test smaller and more practical schemes across the bay for decades. These days, of course, computers can do all of that for a fraction of the time and the money, but it's still a good educational resource. Last time I talked about a grand civil engineering scheme like this, about Herman SÃ¶rgel's Atlantropa, I said it was a testament to how big we can dream, but this model is a testament to something else. To science. To having a hypothesis. To testing it. And then, when it fails, admitting that it's wrong. There shouldn't be any shame in that. Sometimes we follow bad ideas, and changing your mind based on new evidence and allowing others to do the same is something our world should be built on, and it's exactly what this model made happen."
304,Arson as a Christmas Tradition: The GÃ¤vle Goat,"I'm in GÃ¤vle, a city in Sweden, about a hundred miles north of Stockholm. And every year, they have a Christmas tradition: build an enormous goat out of straw and put it in the town square. It's called the GÃ¤vle Goat. There is a second Christmas tradition in GÃ¤vle. Burning the goat down. It's not like Guy Fawkes' Night in Britain, or Burning Man in California, where something is built to be burned down. Burning this down is arson, it is completely illegal, and genuinely, the people who make the giant straw goat do not want their giant straw goat to be burned down. Giant straw goats are expensive. It's just that in the fifty years that a ten-metre-high, mostly-unprotected goat made of extremely flammable straw has been put up here, the goat has only survived twelve times. Usually, it's burned down. In 1976, it was hit by a car. In 1979, it was burned down before it even made it here. In 1988, you could place a bet on whether the goat would burn down. Or at least you could, until the goat burned down. In 2001, an American tourist burned it down, and when he was arrested he said his friends had told him that burning the goat was an entirely legal tradition. He got a couple of weeks in jail, didn't get his cigarette lighter back, and left Sweden without paying a large fine. In 2005, vandals dressed as Santa Claus and gingerbread men fired a burning arrow at the goat and burned it down. In 2006, the city fireproofed the goat. It burned down. In 2009, there were webcams set up to spot vandals. Those cameras were taken offline with a denial of service attack just before the goat burned down. In 2011, they sprayed the goat with water to form a protective coat of ice. It burned down. It is massive and it is made of tinder, it is really, really easy to burn down this goat. Now, the local fire brigade are only two minutes away, and sometimes they win. In 2014, despite three arson attempts, the goat did survive. And now, it's 2016, the goat was put up just a few days ago, and as I record this, it's still there. All it takes to create a tradition like this is the same thing happening for a few years in a row. This goat wouldn't be famous if it didn't burn down. I wouldn't be here. This would just be a small local display. But every year, someone takes the risk of a fine and criminal record and time in jail to try and burn down someone else's hard work, probably because they're drunk when they do it. And that strange, in-the-shadows, battle, that almost sitcom-like plot, gets the world interested, and sends a few tourists to a fairly obscure Swedish city. Place your bets. Quick update: I'm back in London, just landed at Heathrow airport, literally just a few hours after filming that. The goat has already been burned to the ground."
305,The World's Most Dangerous Path Isn't So Dangerous Any More,"The worldâs most dangerous path. The worldâs most treacherous, the worldâs most deadly. This got all those descriptors and more. This is El Caminito Del Rey, near Malaga, on the southern coast of Spain. And, well, once this was the worldâs most dangerous path, or certainly something very close to it. It was built between 1901 and 1905 by sailors and prisoners, who were either used to working at height, or didnât really have much of a choice. And it was used to get people between two hydroelectric power stations, and yes, apparently there were hydroelectric power stations in 1900s Spain. It surprised me too. It was named El Caminito del Rey, the kingâs little pathway, after it was walked by King Alfonso the 13th. But it didnât look like this back then. It was just some metal, hammered into the rock at 45Â°, and then some concrete put on top of it. And maybe thereâd be a bit of a handrail or a safety wire, but it was certainly not safe by modern standards. And over time, the path fell into disuse, and it fell into disrepair, and then just started to fall apart. But that didnât stop thrill seekers. As the internet and the web started to spread news of it, this attracted people from all over the world to come and walk this crumbling but apparently-just-about-safe walkway. And there are photos, all over the web, of 2005 and 2006, of people climbing onto safety wires and walking across very narrow bits of metal to try to get to the next bit. But thatâs not what it looks like now. The trouble was: people kept falling to their deaths, at the rate of one every couple of years. And eventually the local government decided, well, no, this is enough. We are closing this. Which of course just made the problem worse, because now thrill seekers want to do the most dangerous path in the worldâ¦ that had been banned. So eventually they found a solution: build a brand-new path, on top of the ruins of the old one, and build it to 21st-century standards with 21st-century technology. There are safety helmets now. There are handrails, thereâs wire, there is a guard at the entrance checking tickets. And there is wi-fi and toilets at each end. And you know what? It works. Itâs still thrilling, but itâs also safe, and now: there are a heck of a lot more people who have access to this incredible site and the views. But online? This is still the most dangerous path in the world. You will still see the old blog posts from the 2000s, you will still see the old image sharing sites and YouTube videos from five years ago saying, ""oh yeah, this is still dangerous. This is still terrifying."" And of course nobody bothers fact checking online, so, oh, this still gets forwarded everywhere. But this isnât that dangerous any more. It used to be as dangerous as, say, a base jump, it used to attract thrill seekers, the real adrenaline junkies... and now? It attracts tourists who are okay with heights. And I reckon thatâs better. Even if the click bait might not be true any more, a heck of a lot more people have access to what is an incredible place."
306,Pod Cars of the Past and Future: The Morgantown PRT,"This is one of the Personal Rapid Transit pods at London's Heathrow Airport. It'll take you from one of the car parks to Terminal 5, and from Terminal 5 to one of the car parks. And that's about it. When it was installed in 2011, oh, this was going to be the future of transport. But it hasn't really worked out that way. And more than that: they got beaten to the punch by 35 years. Because in 1975, West Virginia University opened this: their own Personal Rapid Transit system. The pods here in the city of Morgantown might not be quite as sleek and rounded... but there's 70 of them, they carry more people, and they go to five stations along an eight-mile track. This really is personal transit: you push a button, and a car arrives to take you where you want to go, non-stop. At peak times, there'll be a car along every few minutes for each separate destination. PRT never shuts down. We have run 40 years without any major incident. 10 inches of snow and weâll be fine. Thatâs because we had a heated track here. Kids donât like it because we keep the school open! There are no variables; if Iâm going from point A to point B, if itâs eight minutes, it is eight minutes. Back in the 1970s, the only option for getting students between all the separate university campuses here was a fleet of buses. But Morgantown is a city with steep hills and narrow roads, so the result was gridlock. And at the time, American politicians were actually having a bit of a craze for systems like this. Richard Nixon announced that there was development money available, and West Virginia senator Robert Byrd, who was famous in part for just how much money he managed to bring back to his own state, he managed to get Morgantown selected as the testing site. The Boeing Company, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were involved with getting the system to work. The system, right now, can carry well over 4000 passengers an hour. Every vehicle, when it departs station, has a route. Every time an assigned vehicle moves over a presence detector, that location is monitored by the station electronics which then conveys that message back to the central control room, and then that message is depicted by the mimic board in central control. And each one of those blinking lights represents a presence detector, but it also represents five seconds of travel time. In the train world, all the switching is done on the track. So the track physically moves to orient a vehicle down a different pathway on a different rail line. In our system, the vehicle switches on board. The result of all that 1970s engineering... well, it was massively over-budget and a little rough around the edges to start, but that happens with prototypes. The important part was: it worked. And it worked well enough to be expanded and kept updated into the 21st century. Well, one of the problems we are having today is with obsolescence of parts for the vehicle, as well for the electronics for the system. And back in the 70s, the Minuteman missile system was the basis for the design of the electronics for the system. And thereâs a company called Thales, and they are here on site now upgrading the electronics and the software for the system. The old system uses a little bit different technology to run cars up and down the guideway. The cars do not know where theyâre located out on the guideway. In the new system, the Thales system, they will know where theyâre at. So thatâs a big help when youâre trying to ask a car where itâs at! The technical manual for the system is online on WVU's web site, and it is 1970s engineering genius. Just like the pods at Heathrow decades later, this was going to be the future of travel. So why wasnât it? Why aren't systems like this everywhere? Well, in most cases you can do almost everything that this can with regular light rail with less upfront cost and less political risk. Sure, the PRT is a bit faster and a bit more efficient, and it's a bit more pleasant to ride, because every journey is non-stop -but the rest of the world went with cheaper, simpler systems... just with much less charm. Itâs the spine of our transportation network. It is also an icon for this institution. We do have some challenges, but we have an excellent crew, a dedicated, passionate crew that just finds a way to make the system work and keep going. Itâs that little engine that could. Thank you to everyone at the Morgantown PRT and West Virginia University. Pull down the description for more links about them, and about the college!"
307,The Town Where Wi-Fi Is Banned: The Green Bank Telescope and the Quiet Zone,"Tucked away in a valley in the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia, is this: the Green Bank Radio Telescope, the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Now if you're building an optical telescope, something that looks at the stars, then you want to be on top of a mountain, you want to get through as much of Earth's atmosphere as you can. But a radio telescope needs to be isolated from all the radio noise that humanity produces. Now, one way is to build it in the middle of a load of mountains. Solid rock does a pretty good job of shielding. But another way is to get everyone around you to just shut up. Welcome to the National Radio Quiet Zone. ...er, this is where I would have used a big, sweeping drone shot to get a dramatic picture. But remote control isn't allowed here. The job of the Green Bank telescope is actually really, really flexible, from looking at objects in the solar system to looking at objects halfway across the universe and further. It was instrumental in uncovering the molten core of Mercury. It helped resolve a sort of controversy in astronomy about the distance to a nearby star cluster. And that might sound a little bit mundane, but measuring distances in astronomy is very hard. And one of the biggest projects the telescope does right now is also looking for living things out there in space. Itâs called the Breakthrough Listen project, and itâs a search for extraterrestrial intelligence using the Green Bank telescope and other facilities like it throughout the world. The Quiet Zone is roughly a rectangle, about 100 miles on each side. And since 1958, the US Government has put strict limits on transmissions within the Zone. Partly for this telescope, and partly because of a much more secure military facility thirty miles away that listened to more earthly communications. Some folks writing about the Quiet Zone, they say that all transmissions are banned for the whole hundred miles, but that's not true: there are cities within the wider parts of the Zone, and the folks there happily use wifi and cell phones. It's the Quiet Zone, not the Silent Zone. Out there, the rules are about big transmitters, the kind that put out TV and radio signals: they're required to use low-powered, directional antennas rather than just spraying signal everywhere. Within ten miles of here, though, the rules start becoming a bit more strict. This telescope is sensitive enough that, if it was pointed the right way, it could pick up a signal with the equivalent energy of one snowflake hitting the ground. And even if it's not pointed right at you, it's got two acres of surface area to hear your phone screaming for cell towers that just aren't there. Living in a place without a cell phone is definitely an interesting change. Before two years ago, I did have a cell phone, could look up anything I wanted on Google. You know, after a week of living here? I didnât even really notice it. The only difference is that you have to plan things ahead more if you want to go out with your friends â you plan in advance, or you say âIâll meet up with them when I meet up with themâ. Things like that. And many, many people have come and gone, stayed for weeks or months at a time, and really none of them have ever said âman, I really miss my cell phoneâ. In the nearby town of Green Bank, anything that transmits, whether itâs baby monitors or wireless doorbells, is banned. So is anything that might cause interference. Microwave ovens arenât allowed. Power lines have to be buried four feet underground. The observatory buildings near the telescope are huge Faraday cages, keeping all the emissions inside. So this is the anechoic chamber that I test in. I first test the device itself to see what the emissions are, then design a box for it, put it back in the chamber, and see if I did a good job or not. Things like cameras, for instance, need to see high frequency electromagnetic energy, namely light, and yet weâre trying to keep them from emitting lower frequency electromagnetic energy. Usually we use a mesh embedded in glass thatâs very fine, and so it doesnât distort the image too much. Once you're within a mile of the telescope, the restrictions are so severe that only diesel cars are allowed. Regular gasoline cars: they cause too much interference from the spark plugs inside. Folks who say they're hypersensitive to electromagnetic fields move to this area: and even if pretty much all the evidence says it's in their heads, they still feel better for being here. The scientists, however, have more practical concerns. Mostly my work here deals with radio-frequency interference on site, and also doing routine runs to see if thereâs anything new out there. We have a monitoring station down on site, and then weâll jump in the truck. And we have direction finding equipment in the truck. We just basically have to look at it with the receiver and the spectrum analyser and just drive around and watch the signal peak or fall away. It is getting more difficult. Because thereâs more and more wireless stuff out there. The wireless genie is out of the bottle. And thereâs so many things out there â the Internet of Things is creeping into almost every device. Refrigerators now have hotspots in them. When we go around and scan for wi-fi hotspots, thereâs always three or four printers out there. The strangest one Iâve heard of was an electric pad in a doghouse. There was some arcing inside the pad, and it was generating a lot of RFI, soâ¦ My predecessorâs the one that found that one, and they fixed it by buying the guy a new heater for the doghouse! Thank you to everyone at the Green Bank Observatory and all the staff at the radio telescope. I am kind of overwhelmed to be up here, I am so grateful to all of them, please, pull down the description, check out the links, and go see what they do."
308,Listening for Nuclear Tests at the Top of the World,"It looks like I'm in the middle of nowhere, and I guess I am. About a mile that way is Qaanaaq, on the west coast of Greenland, about 700 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The town has more sled dogs than people; the locals, some of them, still hunt seals and narwhal when the ice retreats in the summer. And just outside the town, someone is listening for nuclear explosions. In 1989, 183 countries signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The Cold War had just ended, and with the threat of nuclear apocalypse seeming just a little less likely, the idea of the treaty was to completely ban nuclear explosions, even for research. Two decades later, and the treaty is still not enforced, because politics. But the people who drafted the treaty thought that might happen, and created the Preparatory Commission, whose job it is to get everything in place for when the treaty hopefully, eventually, comes into force -and even if it never actually happens, to try and do some good anyway. And this over here is one of the results: IS18, an infrasound listening station, part of a network that spans the planet. Itâs a microbarograph: a set of very precise air pressure sensors, and it listens for very low frequency sound waves, far below the range of human hearing. Theyâre less like sound, and more like massive disturbances in the air that travel round the globe after enormous explosions. I'm an electronics engineer, and my job here, now, is to maintain the infrasound station. If you just put a microbarometer in the air, the noise from the wind will be killing every signal. So we have these arrays, we have 96 inlets. It all goes to the barometer. Because we have that many inlets, it is not really probable that the wind noise will be exactly the same at all those inlets so they are fed to a central manifold and the wind will sort-of cancel out. It really does! Detecting something doesnât mean that thereâs been a nuclear test â it might be a meteor breaking up, a volcano erupting, or even a massive iceberg calving off a glacier nearby â but if it can't be explained like that, then governments should start asking questions. Results from here go to the Commissionâs headquarters in Vienna, via a base in the middle of town, where theyâre combined with those from the dozens of other listening stations around the planet. And as well as that, the commission uses hydroacoustic sensors to detect underwater explosions, seismic stations that detect earthquakes from nuclear tests, and radionuclide detection stations that check the level of radioactivity in the air. You can see from the time difference when the individual stations detect the pressure wave. From that you can deduct what direction it's coming form. The nuclear test ban treaty, if it ever actually comes into force, will apply around the world. Even up here in the Arctic. And theoretically, some rogue government could be ridiculous enough to try and get away with a nuclear test in the Arctic. After all, back in the 20th century, about a fifth of all Soviet nuclear tests were in the Russian Arctic â and that included Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear bomb in history. Even if new testing in the Arctic is unlikely, data from here can still help triangulate other explosions. When youâre designing a network to keep watch on the planet, not just where most of the people live, that network really does have to be global. Even if that means setting up a research base in one of the most remote locations on Earth. I'm here because of Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic! It's an amazing chance to be here on the top of the world, Ellesmere Island, glacier right behind us, and we're going to put on a show in Toronto. Massey Hall, November 12th. And apart from that, go see all the videos from all the people who were on this expedition. Links are on screen and in the description now. Thank you so much! My pleasure. Nice to be here!"
309,The Fake-British Ghost Town In China: Thames Town,"I am still in the Arctic, so todayâs guest video comes from Collin Rodefer over at the Collin Sphere Travel Vlog, whoâs reporting from China. Nice to meet you, my name is Collin and here we are in beautiful Shanghai, China. Home to tens of millions of people, Shanghai is one of the most populated cities in the world. You might know some attractions that Shanghai has to offer, such as the Bund, Nanjing Road, and even the newly opened Disneyland. But despite the enormous population, you might be surprised to find out that here lies, within this city, fully built newly constructed towns that remain virtually empty. Modern day ghost towns. Located at the end of subway line 9 lies Thames Town, an English style ghost town with street names such as Prince and Harry Street. Itâs what you might expect from a replica town which even sports many statues of well-known figures from English history and culture. This town was originally built to service a thriving community. And with shop signs that read âopenâ, you have to take a closer look to realise that the fresh fruits that are on display in the windows are actually fake and that these shots are, in fact, abandoned. On the chance that you do encounter people, itâs not hard to see that this town serves more as a place of tourism, and even more so, a backdrop for wedding photography. Completed in 2006, Thames Town was one of nine Western-style towns to be built on the outskirts of Shanghai. In order to alleviate pressure and congestion within the city centre. It was reported that it cost Â¥5 billion to complete, and can house up to 10,000 people. Its sole purpose was to house students and staff at nine universities in nearby Songjiang University City. As you can tell, ten years later, it just hasnât met that purpose. After walking the perimeter of the town, which only occupies one square kilometre of space, and seeing nothing but empty residential after residential, I decided to test my luck and head into the city centre to see what kind of lively events Thames Town has to offer on a summerâs weekend night. Nothing. So why did this happen? Why did this fail? Well, once the town was completed, the majority of properties were bought up by wealthy investors and individuals looking to make businesses and this place their second home. As naturally, as demand rises, prices rise, and in this case prices skyrocketed, making it unattainable for universities to provide accommodation for their students and staff. So with the majority of properties purchased, you end up with a lot of empty shops, and you have all the businesses trying to provide services for around 1,000 people when the population should really be around ten times that. When you think of a ghost town, you may think of the classic Western American towns we all see in movies with the ever-so-classic tumbleweeds being blown into the distance. The difference between a town like that and this, is that those towns one point developed communities and now we just have the remains of the buildings â whereas here everything is new and clean, and is just... existing. Walking to this town, you definitely get an eerie feeling here, and it kind of almost feels like the Truman Show, as in you know thereâs people living here, however something about it just feels fake. The best way to describe it, I would say, is it kind of feels like a Hollywood set. But behind closed doors it doesnât feel so Hollywood, and you get a totally different feeling. Searching around, I was able to get into a small coffee shop called Andy Coffee, and with the counters turned over and the chairs thrown around, you get the feeling that previous owners just up-and-left the place. Like, they had to be suddenly evacuated. In that moment, I was rather paranoid about being in there, but in hindsight, I really should have just sat down and brewed myself a coffee. The thought that I keep trying to shake is that this is an actual community where people actually live their lives, rather than just being a tourist attraction. And thereâs reasons why there have been many comparisons to the EPCOT Center, and I have to keep reminding myself that I can stay here as long as I want. There is no closing time. Itâsâ¦ itâs quite interesting to say the least, and would I live here? Definitely. Definitely, if I could afford it. If you were to ask me how English this is town actually feel, I would say that other than the Chinese characters around every corner, and other tell-tale signs such as bamboo scaffolding, you would have a hard time differentiating between Thames Town and an actual English town. Of course you can nitpick the small things, like windows being larger in comparison, but this is just a preference of Chinese culture. The middle ground lies somewhere in both the English and Chinese undying love for tea. Now whether this town is deemed successful or not, thatâs not my call. And although the town did not meet its initial purpose, the fact that the majority of the properties were purchased, coupled with the fact that China is now building another one of these towns in Beijing, tells me that they see something worthwhile in building these little western towns. Once again, my name is Collin, and thank you for experiencing this amazing place with me. Thank you, Collin! Go subscribe to his channel now, links are in the description or on screen. Heâs got loads of great videos like that. And what I love about that is finding out that the replica version of London has exactly the same property bubble problem as the real version of London. Next time, the final guest video: and itâs about something that youâve probably seen and probably didnât want to."
310,The Scientifically Inaccurate Dinosaurs That Must Stay That Way,"I'm in Crystal Palace Park, in south London, and there are dinosaurs. Models of dinosaurs, anyway. And inaccurate models at that: but that's because they're more than 150 years old. These were the first ever lifesize models of extinct creatures, built for the gardens of the enormous Crystal Palace that used to stand on top of that hill over there. They were made by the wonderfully-named Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, we now know that they are utterly wrong in many significant ways, but at the time they were a marvel: look at what once walked the earth! Now, in England, there's a list of buildings that have special protection under the law. Buildings on that list are called... Listed Buildings. Because they're on the list. Of buildings. And this country's full of them: Historic England, the not-quite-government organisation that manages the list, says there's about half a million buildings on it. Most of those are only Grade 2 listed, which means they've got to be kept mostly intact, and any changes need a really good reason behind them, but more than 10,000 places are Grade 1 listed, which means they must be preserved. Pretty much anything that was built more than 200 years ago and is still standing is on the list, but there are some more modern things too... including these dinosaurs. Yep. Grade 1 listed dinosaurs. Can't be changed, moved, or demolished, have to kept in good condition. And they can't be updated to reflect what modern palaeontologists know, because that would involve changing them, and destroying not a dinosaur display -but a display about what we once thought dinosaurs looked like, something that's notable not because of what it represents in itself, but because of the history in the sculptures. These dinosaurs must, by law, remain inaccurate, because the story they tell isn't about prehistoric times... it's about science, just 150 years ago. I've done a video with Minute Earth about Null Island, the busiest place that doesn't exist. You can check go it out on their channel. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
311,"The Bus Replacement Rail Service (yes, that's the right way round)","In Britain, the words ""rail replacement bus"" are not good words to hear. It means the train you wanted to take isn't going anywhere, and instead everyone is going to have to get on a slow and lumbering bus that will take at least twice as long and be so much less comfortable. If you've already left the first station, then the rail company is required to get you to your destination... but there's no rule to say how fast. Rail replacement buses are the train traveller's nightmare. Which is why I was surprised to learn that, for just a few days, things were happening the opposite way around: here, between two remote villages in the lowlands of Scotland, there is a very rare sight: the bus replacement train. The normal schedule here is to run every weekend, usually from Easter to the end of September. The bus replacement service was an idea that was born out of some discussions between some villagers and the volunteers on the railway, and then once we realised there would be enough volunteers to run this week, we devised a timetable, and we've now got a daily service for this week. The B797, the tiny road between Leadhills in South Lanarkshire and Wanlockhead in Dumfries and Galloway, is shut for resurfacing. The diversion takes about 45 minutes by road... but by luck, there happens to be a volunteer-run, narrow-gauge railway between the two. There's all volunteers, there are no paid employees at Leadhills at all. We all just give up our time for free. Tomorrow, I'll be the guard, but today, I'm the driver. And we cover all of the different roles. It's being used by people going to the doctor's surgery, for people commuting to work at the Museum of Lead Mining. And a few other places besides. And yes, it looks a little bit ridiculous. But you know what? It works. And it's not often you'll find that a disruption to your journey can actually make your day better. The response has been great so far this week. The villagers are enjoying it, and we've also had a few extra tourists that we wouldn't normally get on a weekday coming to see us. So it's good publicity for the line, and it helps the villagers! Thank you to everyone at the Leadhills and Wanlockhead railway! If you're watching this video on the day or so after it goes up, there may still be time to travel on this service! Details and a link are in the description, along with the dates when they're running steam trains on the track this summer. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
312,"The Strangest Elevator In Italy: the Ascensore Castello d'Albertis-Montegalletto, Genoa","Welcome to Genoa, a beautiful port city in the north of Italy. It's a very vertical city, built on a lot of hills. So many hills, in fact, that the city has several funicular railways and elevators tunnelled through the rock, shortcuts that get around miles of twisty, congested roads or thousands of stairs. And the strangest one of these is the Ascensore Castello d'Albertis Montegalleto. Or: the castle elevator. Years ago, you'd have to walk through 300m of tunnel yourself to reach the lift, but now, if you start at the bottom, an odd little square box comes to pick you up. It looks a bit like a regular elevator car, only going horizontally. You get on, it takes you the 300 metres through the rock, past some control equipment and then, after a bit of shunting around with another box that's headed the other way... It goes vertically, right up to the castle at the top of the hill. Now you might think, that's a great idea in theory, it's like a Star Trek turbolift, but surely that's dangerous? And I say that wearing a red shirt. Elevators need to have all sorts of protection systems so one bad cable can't snap and cause disaster. How can they possibly make one that has all that protection when it's got to detach itself and move off? The answer is: they can't. Because that's not what it's doing. And in hindsight, the solution is kind of obvious: there are two separate systems here. It's the same hack that Disney use for the Tower of Terror at their theme parks: the bit that the passengers get into can only go horizontally on its own. It attaches to a cable that pulls it along. When it reaches the lift shaft, it's actually getting into another, bigger elevator, it attaches itself firmly to that, and then it gets hoisted up and down in safety as if it were a regular passenger elevator. It's a brilliant bit of engineering. And it's all so people don't have to walk 300 metres to a regular lift. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
313,"The Most Dangerous Stretch of Water in the World: The Strid at Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire","Behind me is a bit of water called the Strid. There are a couple of Strids in Britain, but this is the one on the River Wharfe, at Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire. And I reckon it is the most dangerous stretch of water anywhere on Earth. Now that's a bold claim, I know. There are certainly rivers that have taken more lives, and there are rapids and waterfalls that few boats could ever sail. But generally, you can see them coming. This is just an innocent looking stream in the middle of some woods. You could jump over it. People occasionally do. But if you miss that jump, it'll kill you. This is what the river looks like about a hundred metres upstream. Same river. All that water went down. Thanks to the local geology, the river basically turns on its side, gouging out passages and tunnels in the rocks below. Those banks are actually overhangs: there isn't any riverbed just below the surface, it's a deep, boiling mass of fast and deadly currents. There are claims that falling in has a 100% fatality rate. There's no way to confirm that, of course, because ""local person doesn't die in river"" doesn't make the news, but it has claimed a lot of lives: there are even tales from the 12th century of a young boy, set to be the future king of Scotland, who died trying to jump across those waters. And anything, or anyone, that falls in might not come out in any recognisable form: it could just get pulverised against the rocks underwater over and over and over again. I'd try and put a camera in, but then I'd have to get close to the edge. And the edge isn't sharp, it just curves towards the water and it's covered in slippery moss. Besides, the water is opaque and brown with peat stain, you'd see nothing. Is it survivable? Maybe, with a lot of equipment and a lot of luck. And you'll find occasional testimony from foolhardy people who've swum in the calmer pools at the bottom on drier days -but that's also where a young child drowned back in 2010. That's why it's so dangerous. It looks safe, it looks tempting, and it'll kill you. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
314,The Not-Quite-Robots That Help Fix Fusion Reactors,"I am not inside a fusion reactor. It'd be wonderful if I was, the Joint European Torus reactor here at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy is behind some blast doors just a few metres away, but that's not really somewhere humans are meant to go. Not even for maintenance: it's not really dangerous in the same way that current nuclear power plants are, but it contains toxic beryllium and low-level radioactive... stuff. This is the mockup version of the reactor, used for training. And by the way, if the camerawork here seems a little bit odd, that's because it's being done by... well, here. Meet my camera operator. Say hi! I was going to say that my camera operator is a robot, but that's not strictly true either. This isn't a robot, it can't carry out anything automatically: instead, it's a remote handling arm. Basically, it's an extension of John over in the control room. It's not as versatile as a human arm, but it's got enough degrees of freedom. You are actually there, at that point, and not detached from it in a control room. You don't even realise you're doing it. You're actually thinking about the job as you're there, and you're imagining all the components around you. Certainly from the views, we have a VR model as well, which gives us good detail, so from that you actually work at the coalface imagining that the items are there right next to you. It's got very good feedback. Even down to something as thick as a layer of tape. If you were to put that on a smooth surface and run the grip across it you'd be able to feel that level of detail. We have to service the ceiling as well, so the transporter will drive the manipulator upside down and up into position so the operator stays in this position, but gravity changes. So we have to teach the operators to deal with that as well. There are all sorts of cool technologies for remote presence that could be used one day. Virtual reality. Gesture recognition. 3D cameras. All of which would be great: if they work reliably, every time, and if they'll still work and be supported after 10, 20 or 30 years of use in a radioactive environment. This system can't be experimental, it can't be risky, because the only way to fix or upgrade this robot arm inside a reactor is to send in a human. You don't take risks for something like this: you use something that is known to work safely. And I did ask whether I could have a go controlling the remote handling arm. For all those same reasons, the answer was yes... but very, very slowly. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
315,Driving Through Russia Without A Visa: The Saatse Boot,"Right, let's go to Russia. Let's go to Russia! Russia. If you're a British tourist, Russia isn't easy to get into. You have to book your travel, then request a formal invitation from the hotel you're staying at, and then apply for a visa weeks or months in advance. You can't just arrive on a plane and ask them to let you in. And you certainly can't ever, ever just drive across the border. That pole is where they're spying from. Oh, you're right! They must-yes! 'Cos that is lumpy at the top. Cell towers normally go right at the top... There is going to be someone who job is counting the cars in and counting the cars out. And if they see anyone walking towards here... Yeah, of course. That's where the cameras are. Good spot. I'd get my zoom lens out, but I'm not doing that on a Russian border. The area behind me is the Saatse Boot, and it's about one square kilometre of Russia that juts out into Estonia. When Estonia was part of the Soviet Union, that wasn't a problem: but when the country became independent in 1991, a couple of villages on this side of the Boot, including Saatse here, were cut off. Until recently, the road over there was the only way to reach them: there is another way round now, but that's still the quickest route by far. So, for convenience, Russia allows people to use that road... as long as they don't stop. That's the no stopping sign. Yeah. No stopping for... 1km? Right, you see that post, the red and green post? -I do. -That's it. That's Russia. If you're on foot, you're entering Russia, and you can be arrested. If you're in a car, you've got to keep moving: if you stop or if you break down, you're entering Russia, and you can be arrested. Estonia... Estonia... -Russia! -We're in Russia. And I know, immediately, people are going to ask, how far can you push this? What happens if you're on a bicycle? What if you drive 1mph but don't technically stop? What happens if you stand half in and half out, or stop just on the Estonian side of the border and take loads of photos? What happens if you break the law on promoting homosexuality in Russia by playing the Village People out of your car's speakers at full blast? The answer to all of those is: I don't know. It depends on if any border guards see it, and how they feel that day. They might just escort you back to Estonia... they might arrest you and lock you up for the night. Either way, we are not bloody finding out, because it is a really, really bad idea to mess with Russia at all, let alone on their territory, while you're filming it. Now, at some point, like many of the complicated borders in the world, the Boot is going to be fixed. Officially, it was fixed and handed over to Estonia in a treaty back in 2005, and then again by another treaty in 2014. Russia agreed to give up that bit of land in exchange for getting a couple of bits of Estonia somewhere else. And... Estonia! -That's it! -Yeah! But diplomacy is slow, and so is government bureaucracy, and right now, it is still possible to drive through a little bit of Russia without a visa. Just very very carefully. We just drove through Russia without a visa! Wow. It's actually a bit of an anticlimax. Hello! Tourist. Tourist. Yes. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
316,Inside A Satellite Clean Room,"TOM SCOTT: I got an email that said: ""Do you want to come and see our satellite clean room""? Yes. Yes I do. (How do you get into this thing?) WOUTER WEGGELAAR: This is the clean room area. We have a working environment here for the people to work clean. Basically this is a box in a box. And on the roof we have some filters and also in the walls we have ventilation so the air is always going downwards and this is also a laminar flow cleanroom so the air is also going straight down instead of in vortexes. TS: This is Innovative Space Logistics in the Netherlands. Originally a spinoff from TU Delft's engineering department, they now launch Cubesats, like this one -okay, it's a model, that's why I'm allowed to touch it -but they launch satellites like this into actual space. I mean, the rockets go up from all over the world, but some of the satellites that are on board? Put together right here. WW: Well, the cage behind me is a customs area where we have the satellites enter the clean room but not the Netherlands and that's for export reasons. Technically we're exporting these satellites to a country which is the country of launch but they are exporting to space and space doesn't have a box on the forms! TS: There are international standards for cleanrooms. They go from ISO 9, which is just normal air, to ISO 1. Now this room is only ISO 7, which doesn't sound very impressive until you realise it's a log scale: each level of that standard requires a tenth of the dust and particulates. So this room guarantees less than 1% of the dust outside it. WW: So the main contamination source -and that's also why I'm wearing all of this -is particles that are released from our own bodies. Dead skin cells, hairs. If you smoke, even air you exhale. Beard, in my case, because I have a beard mask on. Cardboard, paper, velcro -basically stuff that can hold particles and release it when you don't want to. TS: And it's not just the dust particles that you can see. Those are actually pretty easy. Cleanrooms also have to remove microparticles, things smaller than a bacterium. You don't have to get them all, but you do have to get most of them. WW: This is a small communications satellite called Nayif-1. And this satellite will be a communication experiment and also will be used in classrooms for teaching about space. Schools can pick up the signals from this satellite decode them in the classroom and teach about space, teach about radio. TS: In here, the worst-case scenario is contamination on a camera lens, or a vacuum gyroscope that fails while it's doing 10,000 RPM... in space. This down here is an actual satellite, it's headed for space later this year, and I've got to stand back from it, because if I lean over, dust from me, or spittle from my mouth, could fall down. Won't break anything right now, but in zero-gravity, in vacuum, with direct solar radiation shining down on it? You can't exactly call a breakdown service to fix your satellite. So for safety's sake, it's kept very, very clean. But those ISO 1 cleanrooms? They're for very different missions. WW: ISO 1 cleanrooms is very clean, and basically for Mars missions, or missions to the moon, where we do not want to contaminate the surface of a planet or a body that we go to.

317,The Second Largest Freezer in Norway,"TOM SCOTT: The Youth Winter Olympic Games have brought me out to Lillehammer, in Norway, and to this: the Hunderfossen Bobsleigh Track, the second largest freezer in Norway. I know, you see ""Norway"" and ""freezer"", and you think about the seed vault that's up in the Arctic which is technically bigger than this but this track really is one giant freezer. This track stays frozen in temperatures up to 20Â°C so athletes can speed down here and pull 4G on the final turn even when there really shouldn't be any ice for them to slide on. JAN ODDVAR TANGEN: We can keep it frozen during the summer -in a normal Norwegian summer! It's built with concrete. Inside the concrete, there are lots of layers with pipes. Inside the pipes, it's running with ammonia. TS: When a liquid evaporates, it pulls in heat from the surrounding area. So there are 90 tonnes of ammonia circulating in pipes inside this freezer, underneath the track, being repeatedly compressed and then evaporated to move heat away. Ammonia, by the way, really dangerous if it's not handled properly. JOT: Because ammonia is the fastest working fluid to drag away the warmth. All the ammonia is going inside 65km of pipes and it will stay inside the pipes in all conditions. If something happens, I will shut down the spots that accidentally have the leaks. It's lighter than air, so it will be going upwards so you won't be harmed! TS: But the laws of thermodynamics always hold true. You can't create cold. You can only ever move heat. And in the process of moving it, you generate more heat. That's why the back of your fridge at home is warm, and why air conditioning units need to vent outside. And on a freezer this big? That's quite a lot of heat to move. JOT: The first thing we're doing is cleaning the track with normal hoses with water, cleaning from the summer. And then, start of the season, we're running with luge the first week, and then we start with the skeleton bob after approximately 10 days because then the ice thickness is thick enough to cope with the bob and skeleton. TS: And with bobsleigh and luge runs being measured in hundredths of a second, keeping the ice consistently frozen is important for what is called ""competitive parity"": basically, making sure everyone has a fair shot. A little bit more or less friction over a day could change the result. And when there's this much riding on how fast someone goes down a track? Turns out having a big freezer is really important. There's a load more videos over on the Olympics channel and on my channel, go check 'em out, go subscribe, and thank you to the Youth Winter Olympic Games for bringing me out here to Lillehammer.

318,Why Wuppertal's Suspended Monorail Wasn't The Future Of Travel,"There's a reason that the old, retro-futuristic dreams of monorail travel didn't come true. Nowadays, monorails are mostly known as attractions in theme parks, or short systems around airports, or as impractical, expensive boondoggles. Sydney, Australia, actually demolished theirs a few years ago. Sure, monorails looked cool, but objectively, they're a pretty terrible idea. But in some places in the world: they do work. This is Wuppertal, in Germany, where they don't just have a monorail: they have a century-old suspended monorail that still carries about 80,000 people a day along miles and miles and miles of track. Never mind your 1980s dreams of World's Fairs: construction on this started in the 19th century, and it's been kept up to date ever since. It's like something out of 'Thunderbirds'. There's a fantastic story about it once carrying an elephant -which panicked, fell out into the river, and -amazingly -survived. So why are monorails such a terrible idea? Well, compared to other options, they generally fail on cost and reliability. First, you need a constantly elevated track -the term is 'grade-separated' -along the whole route. Even in the rare case it's down at ground level, you've got to put huge concrete blocks for it to run on rather than just some rails. And given all that cost, governments generally just build one track so if something breaks down, the whole system fails, and passengers have to be evacuated from a great height. You can solve exactly the same problems as a monorail with light rail that doesn't always need an expensive elevated track. Or a tram, that can run along existing streets with just some rails laid down. Or you could just use the simplest option: a bus. Doesn't look as cool, though. [Translating these subtitles?

319,The Russian Woodpecker of Chernobyl: How To See Over The Horizon,"In the 1970s, during the Cold War, if you wanted to see if someone was launching an intercontinental ballistic missile at your country, you had two options: put a satellite in space -which at that point was expensive, impractical, and likely to fail -or build a radar system. But radar can only see to the horizon. It'll show you a missile in flight, but by the time you've seen it your chain of command might not have time to react. You'd need to know it's launched, when it's launched. You need radar powerful enough to bounce off the ionosphere, spread out for thousands of miles, and still have enough signal to be detectable after it bounces back. You need megawatts of power and one of the biggest radar arrays ever constructed. You need something like this. Welcome to the Duga-3 Array, in Chernobyl. This was known in the west as the Russian Woodpecker. For more than a decade, it randomly hopped shortwave frequencies, trying to find the best one to get a return signal, sending out a repetitive rat-t-t-t-t-t-t that sounded like a woodpecker. It was so powerful that countries around the world filed official complaints with the Soviet Union, and there was a small industry of ""Woodpecker filters"" or ""Moscow mufflers"" that would notch it out on your radio. There's another one about 60km away, they act as a pair: one transmits, one receives. And it needs to be this big to get any sort of resolution, so you can tell roughly -very roughly -where the missile's headed. But the really clever thing is how any radar system like this can tell the difference between a missile and the ground. Because this isn't like pointing a radar into the air: if you're bouncing the signal, then the ground is going to reflect back just as much as the missile that's flying above it. How do you tell the difference? Doppler effect. The same way that the siren on a police car moving towards you sounds higher, the radar reflections from a missile will be at a higher frequency. And missiles move at speeds measured in miles per second. So Duga didn't listen for the same frequency that its friend transmitted. It listened for a slightly higher one. If it found that return frequency, then -well. It didn't happen. Fortunately, all that transmission power, all that disruption, was for nothing. Wonderfully. Because no-one ever launched, and somehow, despite everything, humanity got through the Cold War. [Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]"
320,Radioactive Bananas in Chernobyl,"I'm in the abandoned city of Pripyat, in Ukraine. 3km away is the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which exploded in 1986. And ""nuclear power plant"" and ""exploded"" are never something you want to hear in the same sentence. It caused the worst nuclear accident in humanity's history. So I'm here, and I have brought a banana. For scale. Because bananas are radioactive. They're a great source of potassium, and a tiny fraction of that potassium -about one part in 10,000 -is an unstable, radioactive isotope. Every second, a few hundred potassium atoms in this banana decay. Which is enough that a containerful of bananas can cause false alarms at shipping docks where they're looking for radioactive bombs. Bananas are called a ""legitimate radioactive material"". So why are we still eating them? Well, that much radiation is basically nothing. There's something called the banana equivalent dose: it's not a serious measurement, particularly because your body regulates your potassium levels anyway and you'd just get rid of it, but it's a good way to get an idea of how dangerous something is, and how dangerous this city is. If you just spend a night sleeping next to someone, anywhere on earth: you'll get half a banana's dose. We've got potassium in us as well, so we're all very slightly radioactive. Being here, in the city next to the world's worst nuclear accident? Three bananas an hour, rising to twenty or thirty in a few areas. That sounds like a lot, until you realise that the cosmic radiation I got on the airplane flight here was about a hundred bananas, or about a chest x-ray. The actual danger here in most parts of Pripyat and Chernobyl, is not from background radiation. Nearer the plant, and in some less-travelled areas, yes; the workers who are building the new confinement structure have very strict limits on how long they can linger. But the danger here is from fallout, from material left behind in the 1986 explosion, it's from the vegetation that's very good at pulling radioactive particles into itself, it's from kicking up dust and breathing it in, it's from things getting into your system and staying there. I'm not allowed to put any of my belongings down on the ground just in case they pick up dust, and I'll be scanned for radiation when I leave, just in case. Radiation isn't some terrifying spectre, if it's managed properly. If it's not: well, even now, nearly thirty years after the Chernobyl disaster, everyone in Europe is still getting about an extra twenty or thirty bananas of radiation every year.

321,Containing the Worst Nuclear Disaster in History: Chernobyl's New Confinement Structure,"This is how you contain the worst nuclear disaster in humanity's history. This is the New Safe Confinement structure, at Reactor 4 at Chernobyl. In 1986, the nuclear power plant here exploded -and that is a sentence you never ever want to hear. The local area was evacuated, and it won't be safe to live in for millennia: to get here you need special permissions, although it's become a bit easier in recent years. In the months after the disaster, a concrete sacrophagus -it's called the Shelter Object -was built around the damaged reactor. It was constructed rapidly and desperately. It cost a lot of lives, and used a megaton of concrete and metal. It worked, but it won't hold forever, and it was built on top of the unstable debris of the old reactor. But over there is its replacement, still under construction. It's the New Safe Confinement, and it has cost more than one and a half billion US dollars. It is enormous, a steel arch a hundred metres high. When it's done, it'll be hauled by steel cables on enormous tracks over the reactor over the course of a week. And once it's there: the sides will be filled in, and the reactor will be contained again, ready to be decommissioned safely. This is the world's largest movable structure -although it's only going to have to move once. And it's got some pretty astonishing design requirements. It can't let anything leak out. And it has to withstand everything that Ukraine's weather can possibly throw at it for a hundred years. But just think about that. One and a half billion dollars for something that'll last a hundred years. That's great -provided in that hundred years, we can find the money, time and technology to safely dispose of all the radioactive waste that's going to be in there. Will we do that? Or, once there's not an imminent threat of disaster, will we kick it down the road for a future generation to deal with? In a hundred years, when this arch is at the end of its lifespan, will we be dismantling it and celebrating a job well done? Or will we be spending another huge sum building its replacement?
