1,1,NVIDIA's AI Makes Amazing Slow-Mo Videos!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you how to fill in missing frames in slow-motion videos. This technique builds on U-Net, a superfast convolutional neural network architecture. This neural network was trained on a bit over a 1,000 videos and computes multiple approximate optical flows and combines them in a way that tries to minimize artifacts. As the current, commercially available tools are super slow and take forever, I cannot wait to be able to use this technique to make some more amazing slow motion footage for you Fellow Scholars!

2,2,DeepMind's AI Takes An IQ Test!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is the co-founder of DeepMind, a company that develops artificial intelligence programs. He says the holy grail of machine learning research is a general AI that is capable of obtaining new knowledge by itself through abstract reasoning. To tackle this problem, scientists at DeepMind created a program that is able to generate a large amount of problems that test abstract reasoning capabilities. They are inspired by human IQ-tests with all the these questions about sizes, colors and progressions. This is indeed a step towards teaching an AI how to reason, and as the authors made this dataset publicly available for everyone, I expect a reasonable amount of research works appearing in this area in the near future who knows, perhaps even in the next few months. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Károley. Back to the page you came from. The Two Minute Papers is a weekly, off-beat look at the latest developments in the field of artificial intelligence.

3,3,DeepMind Has A Superhuman Level Quake 3 AI Team!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at an AI that beats the Capture The Flag game mode in Quake 3. The AI agents learned by looking at the video output of the game and have never been told anything about the game or what the rules are. This builds on a new architecture by the name For The Win, FTW in short. Instead of training one agent, it uses a population of agents that train and evolve from each other to make sure that a diverse set of playstyles are discovered. In another experiment, two agents were paired up against two professional tester who could freely communicate with the same agents. The reaction time and accuracy of the agents is better than that of humans, but they outclass humans if we artificially reduce their accuracy and reaction times. And now, a human+agent team has been able to defeat an team that has been given 5% of the time, indicating these AIs are able to coordinate and play with anyone they are given to play with.

4,4,This is How You Hack A Neural Network,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: A new piece of work on how to hack and reprogram neural networks to make them perform any task we want. This work reveals a new kind of vulnerability by performing this kind of reprogramming of neural networks in an adversarial manner, forcing them to perform tasks that they were originally not intended to do. Potential consequences of adversarial repprogramming include theft of computational resources from public facing services, and repurposing of AI-driven assistants into spies or spam bots.

5,5,DeepMind's AI Learns The Piano From The Masters of The Past,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: A new AI from DeepMind is capable of creating beautiful piano music. While we listen, I'll show you the composers it has learned from to produce this. I have  never heard any AI-generated music before with such articulation and the harmonies are also absolutely amazing. For now, let's marvel at one more sound sample. This is already incredible, and I can only imagine what we will be able to do not ten years from now, just a year from now.

6,6,OpenAI + DOTA2: 180 Years of Learning Per Day,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about DOTA 2, a multiplayer online battle arena game with a huge cult following and world championship events with a prize pool of over 40 million dollars. Last time we talked about this in Two Minute Papers episode 180, an AI beat some of the best players of the game in a limited 1 versus 1 setting. This was a huge milestone as this game requires long-term strategic planning, has incomplete information and a high-dimensional continuous action space. The next milestone was set to defeat a human team in the full 5 versus 5 game, and I promised to report back when there is something new on this project. Now, you better hold on to your papers right away, because this video dropped 10 months ago, in August 2017, and since then, the AI has played 180 years worth of gameplay against itself every single day. 80% of these games it played against itself, and 20% against its past self, and even though five of these bots are supposed to work together as a team, there is no explicit communication channel between them. There will be an upcoming event on July 28th where these bots will challenge a team of top players, so stay tuned for some more updates on this! There is no paper yet, but I've put a link to a blog post and the full video in the description.",DOTA 2 - A Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Game With a Huge Cult Following
7,7,OpenAI's Gaming AI Contest: Results,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at a contest by OpenAI to see who has the best transfer learning capabilities. In this experiment, these programs start playing Sonic the Hedgehog, and are given a bunch of levels to train on. After one minute of training, the AI is still quite inept and does not make any meaningful progress on the level. After 30 minutes, things look significantly better as the AI now understands the basics of the game. And look here, almost got up there, and, got it. It is clearly making progress as it collects some coins, defeats enemies, goes through the loop, and gets stuck seemingly because it doesn't yet know how being under water changes how high it can jump. This is quite a bit of a special case, so, we are getting there. After only 60-120 minutes, it became a competent player and was able to finish this challenging map with only a few mistakes. Really impressive transfer learning in just about an hour. And note that the algorithm has never seen this level before. And now you see that we have a job where we train computers to play video games, and we are even paid for it. What a time to be alive. By the way, if you wish to unleash the inner scholar in you, Two Minute Papers shirts are available in many sizes and colors.",The Best Transfer Learning Contest
8,8,Style Transfer...For Smoke and Fluids!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a technique that performs style transfer, but this time, not for paintings, but for fluid and smoke simulations. It takes the low-resolution source and detailed target footage, dices them up into small patches and borrows from image and texture synthesis techniques to create a higher resolution version of our input simulation. The challenge of this technique is that we cannot just put more swirly motion on top of our velocity fields because this piece of fluid has to obey to the laws of physics to look natural. Have a look at the ground truth results from the high resolution simulation this is the one that would take a long time to compute. There are clearly deviations, but given how coarse the input footage was, I'll take this any day of the week. We can now look forward to seeing even higher quality smoke and fluids in the animation movies of the near future. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

10,10,Infinite Walking in Virtual Reality,"The promise of virtual reality is indeed truly incredible. Doctors could be trained to perform surgery in a virtual environment, or even perform surgery from afar. We could enhance military training by putting soldiers into better flight simulators, expose astronauts to virtual zero-gravity simulations, and of course, games. The technique takes into consideration even other moving players in the room and dynamically remap our virtual paths to make sure we don't bump into them. There is a lot more in the paper that describes how the whole method adapts to human perception. Papers like this make me really happy because there are thousands of papers in the domain of human perception within computer graphics, many of which will now see quite a bit of practical use. VR is going to be a huge enabler for this area. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Back to Mail Online home.

11,11,An AI For Image Manipulation Detection,"A new learning-based algorithm can look at any image and highlight the regions that were tampered with. It can detect image splicing, which means that we take part of a different image and add it to this one. The algorithm is able to detect these anomalies too. This is great because a smart attacker may try to conceal their mistakes by recompressing an image and thereby adding more artifacts to it. With a little modification, we can perhaps turn it around and use it as a discriminator to help training a neural network that produces better forgeries. It is of utmost importance that we inform the public that these tools exist.

13,13,Faceforensics: This AI Detects DeepFakes!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: If we can train an AI to impersonate, why not train an other AI to detect impersonation? This has to be an arms race. We need a large dataset to train a neural network-based solution. This paper contains a useful dataset with over a 1000 videos that we can use to train such a network. After the training step, the algorithm will be able to pick up on the smallest changes around the face and tell a forged footage from a real one, even in cases where we humans are unable to do that. This could be super useful for animating photorealistic characters for video games and movies, reviving legendary actors who are not with us anymore, and much more. I bet there will be many completely authentic videos that will be thought of as fakes by humans in the near future. I wonder if it can detect footage that is has improved itself? What do you think?

A key part of this new technique is that it extracts additional data such as pose and eye positions both from the source and target videos. The results are truly mesmerizing, I almost fell out of the chair when I've first seen them. It also contains a great idea that opens up the possibility of creating quantitative evaluations against ground truth footage.

15,15,Curiosity-Driven AI: How Effective Is It?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We have seen some amazing results from DeepMind's Deep Q Learning algorithm that performed on a superhuman level on many games, but faltered on others. What really made the difference is the sparsity of rewards and the lack of longer-term planning. This work is about introducing an intrinsic reward by endowing an AI with one of the most humanlike attributes: curiosity. In short, this AI is driven to explore, even if it hasn't been told how well it is doing. It will naturally start exploring levels in Super Mario, even without seeing the score. And now comes the great part: this curiosity really teaches the AI to learn new skills, and when we drop it into a new, previously unseen level, it will perform much better than a non-curious one. This will be able to play much harder games than previous works. And remember, games are only used to demonstrate the concept here, this will be Able to do so much more. Love it.

16,16,Neural Image Stitching And Morphing,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: An AI-based technique that is able to find corresponding points between our pair of images. This enables two killer applications. One, this can augment already existing artistic tools so that we can create a hybrid between two images. And two, it can also perform cross-domain image morphing. This tool is going to be invaluable for, I was about to say artists, but this doesn't require any technical expertise, just good taste and a little bit of imagination.

17,17,NVIDIA's AI Removes Objects From Your Photos!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows how NVIDIA's AI-based solution to image inpainting works. Traditional non-learning approaches either try to fill these holes in with other pixels from the same image that have similar neighborhoods. This work also borrows from earlier artistic style transfer methods to make sure that not only the content, but the style of the inpainted regions also match the original image. It is also remarkable that this new method works with images that are devoid of symmetries and can also deal with cases where we cut out really crazy, irregularly shaped holes. Without doubt, this is going to be an invaluable tool for artists in the future. The paper contains a ton more of these comparisons, so make sure to have a look. The quality of different techniques is measured against a reference output. This new method produces more convincing results than its competitors. For reference, PatchMatch is a landmark paper from almost 10 years ago that still represents the state of the art for non learning-based techniques. In fact, in this very series, we use Photoshop's built-in image inPainting tool on a daily basis, so this will make our lives much easier. Loving it.

19,19,This AI Learned To See In The Dark!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Cameras that work remarkably well in well-lit scenes produce almost unusable results in dim environments. He shows how an AI-based technique takes sensor data from the first, unusable image, and produces this output image in less than a second. The key idea is to use different exposure times for the input and output images. This is because more light is let in, and we'll get brighter and clearer images. I really hope we get a software implementation of something like this in the smartphones of the near future, that would be quite amazing.

The efficiency of this population is assessed, and new offsprings are created from the best performing candidates. After only 5 hours of training, it was able to find a way to abuse game mechanics in Q*bert in the most creative ways. It has found a glitch where it sacrifices itself to lure the purple blob into dropping down after it. It also found and exploited another serious bug which was previously unknown after completing the first level, it starts jumping around in a seemingly random manner.

24,24,This AI Reproduces Human Perception,"Assessing how similar two images are has been a long standing problem in computer graphics. If we build a database from many of these human decisions, feed it into a deep neural network, we'll find that this network will be able to learn and predict how humans see differences in images.

25,25,This AI Learns From Its Dreams ,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about an AI that plays video games really well, and can also dream up new, unseen scenarios. This is an interesting new framework that contains a vision model that compresses what it has seen in the game into an internal code. It is also endowed with a controller unit that is responsible for making decisions as to how to play the game. In this racing game, on a selection of a 100 random tracks, its average score is almost three times that of DeepMind's groundbreaking Deep Q-Learning algorithm. And now comes the even more exciting part! Because it can create an internal dream representation of the game, and this representation really captures the essence of thegame, then it means that it is also be able to play and train within these dreams. It makes up dream scenarios and learns how to deal with them without playing the actual game. And the cool thing is that with this AI, this dream training actually works, which means that the newly learned dream strategies translate really well to the real game. We really have only scratched the surface, so make sure to read the paper in the description. This was a really new and fresh idea, and I think it will give birth to a number of followup papers. Cannot wait to report on these back to you.",AI That Plays Video Games Really Well

28,28,AI Photo Translation,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: A new breed of AI techniques surfaced that were capable of this new thing called image translation. This is done through a Generative Adversarial Network. This architecture where we have a pair of neural networks, one that learns to generate new images, and the other learns to tell a fake image from a real one. As they compete against each other, they get better and better without any human interaction.

29,29,4 Experiments Where the AI Outsmarted Its Creators!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you four experiments where AI researchers were baffled by the creativity and unexpected actions of their own creations. In the first experiment, robots were asked to walk around while minimizing the amount of foot contact with the ground. The scientists wondered how that is even possible, and pulled up a video of the proof. This proof showed a robot flipping over and walking using its elbows. A different robot arm experiment also came to a surprising conclusion. At first, the robot arm had to use its grippers to grab a cube, which it successfully learned to perform. However, in a later experiment, the gripper was crippled, making the robot unable to open its fingers. This demonstrates that when trying to maximize the probability of the survival of an entire colony, the concept of communication and cooperation can emerge even from simple neural networks. And what is even more incredible, is that later, when a new reward system was created that fosters self-preservation, the robots learned to deceive each other by lighting up the the food signal near the poison to take out their competitors and increase their chances. And these behaviors emerge from a reward system and a few simple neural Networks. Mind blowing. Make sure to have a look at the paper, there are many more experiments that went similarly, including a case where the AI found a bug in a physics simulation program to get an edge.",The Science of Artificial Intelligence
30,30,Gaussian Material Synthesis (SIGGRAPH 2018),"The team developed a system for rapid mass-scale material synthesis. It uses a convolutional neural network to predict images of materials that are close to the ones generated via global illumination, and takes less than 3 milliseconds per image. Sometimes a recommended material is close the one envisioned by the user, but requires a bit of fine-tuning. This adjustment doesn't require any domain expertise or direct interaction with a material modeling system and can be done in real time. After assigning the appropriate materials, displacements and other advanced effects can be easily added to these materials. The team also experimented with an extended, more expressive version of their shader that also includes procedural textured albedos and displacements. They hope to see more exploratory works combining the advantages of multiple state of the art learning algorithms in the future. The work was published in the open-source journal, Theoretical and Applied Computer Graphics (TCG) The team is now working on a version of the work for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One, as well as a version for the PC and Xbox One. For more information, visit www.ctg.org.uk and follow them on Twitter @TCG_Research and @ctgstudio. The project is also on GitHub.",The New CTG System for Rapid Mass-Scale Material Synthesis
31,31,Evolving Generative Adversarial Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Szeged in Hungary. He is the author of two papers on the evolution of neural networks. He says the technique mimics the steps of evolution in nature: evaluation and selection and variation. The resulting algorithm can be trained in a more stable way, and it can create new bedroom images when being shown a database of bedrooms. It can also generate new human faces that are quite decent. We are also getting very close to an era where we can generate thousands of convincing digital characters from scratch to name just one application. What a time to be alive!

32,32,Das täuscht deine Sicht | Two Minute Papers # 241,"Neural networks are amazing at recognizing objects when being shown an image. But they have an interesting property where we can add small changes to an input photo and have the network misclassify it to something completely different. A super effective neural network can be reduced to something that is less accurate than a coinflip with a properly crafted adversarial attack. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Is it possible that some of the properties of machine vision systems can be altered to fool the human vision? And now, hold on to your papers, I think you know what's coming. This algorithm performs an adversarial attacked on you. This image depicts a cat. And this image depicts, uh... a dog? Surely it's a dog, right? Well, no. This is an image of a previous cat plus some carefully crafted noise that makes it look like a dog. And despite that, we still see it as a dog! This is insanity. The technique works by performing an adversiliar attack against an AI model, and modifying the noise generator model to better match the human visual system. And it turns out that some. of these noise distributions are also useful against the humanvisual system. Make sure to have a look at the paper, I have found it to be an easy read, and quite frankly I am stunned by the result. It is clear that machine learning research is progressing at a staggering pace, but I haven't expected this at all.

33,33,One Pixel Attack Defeats Neural Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Many neural networks can be defeated by only changing one pixel. By changing only one pixel in an image that depicts a horse, the AI will be 99.9% sure that we are seeing a frog. A ship can also be disguised as a car, or, amusingly, almost anything can be seen as an airplane. Also, our next episode is going to be on adversarial attacks on the human vision system.

36,36,AI Learns Human Pose Estimation From Videos,"The project is a collaboration between INRIA and Facebook AI research and is about pose estimation. Pose estimation means that we take an input photo or in the cooler case, video of people, and the output should be a description of their postures. This is kind of like motion capture for those amazing movie and computer game animations, but without the studio and the markers. This work goes even further and tries to offer a full 3D reconstruction of the geometry of the bodies, and it is in fact doing way more than that as you will see in a minute.

It uses a neural network to extract attributes like length, spikiness, are there hair buns, is there a ponytail, where the hairline is, and more. This is an extremely deep neural network with over 50 layers and it took 40 thousand images of different hairstyles to train. The technique also supports retargeting, which means that our gestures can be transferred to different characters. The framework is also very robust to different lighting conditions, which mean that a differently lit photograph will lead to very similar outputs. The final result also includes secondary components like eyes, teeth, tongue, and gum. It can be used in video games or any telepresence application where a set of users interact in a virtual world.

40,40,Why Should We Trust An AI?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: If we don't trust a classifier, we won't use it. He says the best way of earning the trust of a human would be if the AI could explain how it came to a given decision. The tests indicate that humans make significantly better decisions when they lean on explanations that are extracted by this technique. The technique is model agnostic, which means that it can be applied to other learning algorithms that are able to perform classification. It is also a possibility that an AI is only right by chance, and if this is the case, we should definitely know about that. The source code of this project is also available.

41,41,"DeepMind's WaveNet, 1000 Times Faster","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: WaveNet is a text to speech algorithm that takes a sentence as an input, and gives us audio footage of these words being uttered by a person of our choice. All this requires is some training data from this person's voice, typically 10-30 hours, and, a ton of computational power. The computational power part is especially of interest, because we have to produce over 16 to 24 thousand samples for each second of continuous audio footage. And unfortunately, as you can see here, these new samples are generated one by one. We need to make this more parallel somehow. So, the solution is simple, instead of one, we can just simply make more samples in parallel. And, this yields a blistering fast version of WaveNet that is over a 1000 times faster than its predecessor. And you know what the best part is? Usually, there are heavy tradeoffs for this, but this time, the validation section of the paper reveals that there is no perceived difference in the outputs from the original algorithm. Hell yeah! So, where can we try it? Well, it is already deployed online in Google Assistant in multiple English and Japanese voices. It is not real time, but 20 times faster. What a time to be alive!",WaveNet - A Text to Speech Algorithm That Takes a Sentence and Says It
42,42,Bubble Collision Simulations in Milliseconds,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Simulating on a computer what happens when bubbles collide. This is typically done by simulating the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the evolution of the velocity and pressure within a piece of fluid over time. Because the world around us is a continuum, we cannot compute these quantities in an infinite number of points. So, we have to subdivide the 3D space into a grid, and compute them only in these gridpoints. The finer the grid, the more details appear in our simulations. We can write a computer program that reproduces what would happen in reality and result in lots of beautiful video footage. And, the best part is that the first surface evolution step is done through an effective implementation of the hyperbolic mean curvature flow, which means that the entirety of the process is typically 3 to 20 times faster than the state of the art while being more robust in handling splitting and merging scenarios. The computation times are now in the order of milliseconds instead of seconds. The paper is beautifully written, and there are plenty of goodies therein, for instance, an issue with non-manifold junctions is addressed, so make sure to have a look. The source code of this project is also available.",Simulation of Bubbles Colliding on a Computer
43,43,This AI Sings,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created an AI vocoder that is able to synthesize believable singing from MIDI and lyrics as inputs. The vocoder separates the pitch and timbre components of the voice, therefore the waveforms are not generated directly, which is a key difference from Google DeepMind's WaveNet. This is one important stepping stone towards synthesizing singing that is highly usable in digital media and where generation is faster than real time. The test showed that this new method is well ahead of the competition, approximately midway between the previous works and the reference singing footage. There are plenty of other tests in the paper, this is just one of many, so make sure to have a look.

44,44,Pruning Makes Faster and Smaller Neural Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Pruning helps create neural networks that are faster and smaller. This particular technique is specialized for pruning Convolutional Neural Networks, where the neurons are endowed with a small receptive field and are better suited for images. Initial tests reveal that around a quarter of the filters can be pruned with an accuracy loss of 0.3%. With a higher b, we can prune more than 75% of the filter with a loss of around 3%. This is incredible. It is really great to see that new research works make neural networks not only more powerful over time, but there are efforts in making them smaller and more efficient at the same time.

45,45,Google's Text Reader AI: Almost Perfect,"Google's WaveNet is a learning-based text-to-speech engine. After a training step using someone's voice, it has to read it aloud using this person's voice as convincingly as possible. The magic component in this new work is using Mel spectrograms as an input to WaveNet. This is an intermediate representation that is based on the human perception that records not only how different words should be pronounced, but the expected volumes and intonations as well. The new model was trained on about 24 hours of speech data. And of course, no research work should come without some sort of validation. The mean opinion score is a number that describes how a sound sample would pass as genuine human speech. And this is truly incredible, because most of the time, people had no idea which was which if you don't believe it, we'll try this ourselves in a moment. A very small, but statistically significant tendency towards favoring the real footage was recorded, likely because some words, like ""merlot"" are mispronounced. Automatically voiced audiobooks, automatic voice narration for video games. What a time to be alive! Note that producing these waveforms is not real time and still takes quite a while. To progress along that direction, scientists as DeepMind wrote a heck of a paper where they sped WaveNet up a thousand times.",WaveNet - A New Text-To-Speech Engine
46,46,SLAC Dataset From MIT and Facebook ,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a dataset created through a joint effort between MIT and Facebook. Datasets are used to train and test the quality of learning algorithms. This particular dataset contains short video clips. These clips are passed to a neural network which is asked to classify the kind of activity that is taking place in the video. In this dataset, there are many cases where everything is given to come to a logical answer that is wrong. We may be in a room with the climbing wall, but exercising is not necessarily happening. And here comes the more interesting part when trying to train a neuralNetwork for other, loosely related tasks, using this dataset for pre-training improves the scores significantly.

48,48,Reinforcement Learning With Noise (OpenAI),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about improving reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a learning algorithm that we can use to choose a set of actions in an environment to maximize a score. This problem is especially difficult when the rewards are sparse. Scientists at OpenAI proposed an approach where they add noise not directly to the actions, but the parameters of the agent. This leads to less flailing and a more systematic exploration that substantially decreases the time taken to learn tasks with sparse rewards. The solution does not come without challenges, and, the effect of the noise on the outputs grows over time, which requires changing the amount of noise to be added depending on its expected effect on the output. This technique is called adaptive noise scaling. There are plenty of comparisons and other cool details in the paper, make sure to have a look, it is available in the video description.

Intuitive psychology is present in young infants. We can try to endow an AI with similar knowledge by feeding it with physics simulations and their evolution over time. This could be used to augment already existing neural networks and give them a better understanding of the world around us.

51,51,This Autonomous Robot Models Your House Interior,"The goal of this work is to have a robot that automatically creates a 3D model of an indoor space, including path planning and controlling attention. This robot uses an RGBD camera, so beyond the colors, it also gets some depth information that describes how far the viewed objects are from the observer. From this information, it tries to create a 3d digital model of these interiors. It not only does that, but it also constantly replans its trajectory based on newly found areas. These paths have to be smooth and walkable without bumping into objects, and of course, adapt to the topology of the building. You'll see in a moment why even this mundane sounding smooth path part is really challenging to accomplish. Spoiler alert: it's about singularities. This new proposed tensor field representation contains a lot fewer singularities, and its favorable mathematical properties make it sink-free. This leads to much better path planning which is crucial for maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Previous works on neural texture synthesis focused on how different features in a given layer relate to the ones before and after it. This new method is about changing the inputs and the outputs of the network to be able to process these images at different scales. These scales range from coarser to finer versions of the same images. In a future work, it would be super useful to extend this algorithm to have a greater understanding of the structure and the symmetries of the input images into consideration.

The technique can simulate viscous and elastic fluids, plus rigid and deformable bodies. The simulation phase here took place at one frame per second, which is still not yet fast enough for the much coveted real-time applications, however, is super competitive compared previous off-line techniques that could do this. Have a look at this honey pouring scene. This simulation uses more than a 100 thousand particles and 6 of these frames can be simulated in just 1 second. If we reduce the number of particles to a few tens of thousands,real-time human interaction with these simulations also becomes a possibility.

55,55,Distilling Neural Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Decision trees take into consideration a series of variables and provide a clear roadmap towards a decision based on them. It is shown that these trees perform better than traditional decision trees. What's more, they are only slightly worse than the corresponding neural networks, but can explain their decisions much more clearly and are also faster. In summary, the rate of progress in machine learning research is truly insane these days, and I and am all for papers that try to provide us a greater understanding of what is happening under the hood.

57,57,AlphaZero: DeepMind's New Chess AI,"AlphaZero is based on a neural network and reinforcement learning and is trained entirely through self-play after being given the rules of the game. AlphaZero was able to outperform Stockfish in about 4 hours of learning from scratch. They played a 100 games AlphaZero won 28 times, drew 72 times and never lost to Stockfish. With every paper from DeepMind, the algorithm becomes better AND more and more general. This is the equivalent of intuition in other words, being able to identify a small number of moves and focusing on them. And we are even being paid for this? I can tell you, this is very rarely the case. Total insanity. I think that as computers and processing power increases over time, all we have to do is add more time to the algorithm and brute force to just evaluate more positions. If you think this is the case, have a look at this paper at this Unreal Chills run down my spine as I read this paper. It might very well be in a couple of years, but given the trajectory of the improvements we've seen lately, it might very likely be in the next few months or even years. I will note that I was told by DeepMind that this is a preliminary version of the paper, so now we shall have an initial look, and perhaps make a part 2 video with the newer results when the final paper drops.",AlphaZero - The New Game
58,58,AI Learns Noise Filtering For Photorealistic Videos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new technique for light simulation. The technique uses a Recurrent Neural Network, which is able to deal with sequences of data. It remembers how it dealt with the previous images a few moments ago, and, as a result, it can adjust and produce outputs that are temporally stable. In the very near future, we'll run learning-based noise filters that take images that are so noisy, they don't even have one ray sample per pixel. This is going to be the new milestone. Computer games, VR and all kinds of real-time applications will be able to get photorealistic light simulation graphics in real time. And for video, this is insanity. I need to take some time to digest this. If someone told me that this would be possible when I started doing light transport as an undergrad student, I wouldn't have believed a word of it.

Pneumonia is an inflammatory lung condition that is responsible for a million hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths per year in the US alone. The training set used for this algorithm contained over a 100,000 images of over 30,000 patients. This is not the only algorithm for pneumonia detection, and it has been compared to the state of the art for all 14 diseases, and this new technique came out on top on all of them.

He explains how a new algorithm is about architecture search that does exactly that. In this chart, you can see the number of evolution steps on the horizontal x axis, and the performance of these evolved architectures over time on the vertical y axis. Finally, after taking about 1.5 days to perform these few thousand evolutionary steps, the best architectures found by this algorithm are only slightly inferior to the best existing neural networks for many classical datasets.

63,63,Meta Learning Shared Hierarchies,"Reinforcement learning is a technique where we have a virtual creature that tries to learn an optimal set of actions to maximize a reward in a changing environment. Playing video games, helicopter control, and even optimizing light transport simulations are among the more awesome example use cases for it. And this algorithm is very much like how humans learn it breaks down a big and complex task into sequences of smaller actions. The search space over sub-policies can easily be a hundred or more times smaller than the original search space of all possible actions, therefore this kind of search is way more efficient than previous techniques. Creating more general learning algorithms is one of the holy grail problems of AI research, and this one seems to be a proper, proper step towards defeating it. We're not there yet, but it's hard not to be optimistic with this incredible rate of progress each year. Really excited to see how this area improves over the next few months.

64,64,Image Matting With Deep Neural Networks,"Image matting is the process of taking an input image, and separating its foreground from the background. Traditional techniques rely on useful heuristics, like assuming that the foreground and the background are dominated by different colors. This is useful, but of course, it's not always true, and clearly, we would get the best results if we had a human artist creating these alpha mattes. The main reason why humans are successful at this is that they have an understanding of the objects in the scene. So perhaps, we could come up with a neural network-based learning solution that could replicate this ideal case. The first part of this algorithm is a deep neural network that takes images as an input and outputs an alpha matte, which was trained on close to 50 thousand input-output pairs. So here comes the second, refinement stage where we take the output matte from the first step and use a more shallow neural network to further refine the edges and sharper details. There are a ton of comparisons in the paper, and we are going to have a look at some of them, and as you can see, it works remarkably well for difficult situations where many tiny hair strands are to be matted properly. If you're interested, we also have some nice Two Minute Papers shirts for your enjoyment.",Image Matting - A Neural Network Based Learning Solution

67,67,Generalizing AI With Neural Task Programming,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Algorithms of this type we often refer to as a weak AI, or narrow AI. A key to extend these algorithms would be to design them in a way that their knowledge generalizes well to other problems. This is what we call transfer learning, and this collaboration between the Stanford AI lab and Caltech goes by the name Neural Task Programming. This technique is a bit like divide and conquer type algorithms that aggressively try to decompose big, difficult tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. The smaller and easier to understand the pieces are, the more reusable they are and the better they generalize. Now, please don't take this as a complete solution for AGI, because it is a fantastic piece of work, but it's definitely not that. However, it may be a valuable puzzle piece to build towards the final solution. We advance one step at a time. Man, what an amazing time to be alive.

The dataset used for training the neural network contains 75 different clouds, some of which are procedurally generated by a computer, and some are drawn by artists to expose the learning algorithm to a large variety of cases. As a result, these images can be rendered in a matter of seconds to minutes. I think this work is also a great testament to show how these incredible learning algorithms can accelerate progress in practically all fields of science. And given that this work was done by Disney, I am pretty sure we can expect tons of photorealistic clouds in their upcoming movies in the near future.

70,70,Video Game Graphics To Reality And Back,"Researchers at NVIDIA have been hitting it out of the park lately, and this work is no different. This technique performs image translation, which means that the input is an image of our choice, and the output is the same image with somewhat different semantics. Remarkably, with this new work, converting dogs and cats into different breeds is also a possibility. So that means that it can also perform real to synthetic image translation and vice versa. And even more remarkably, convert video game footage to real world video. This is insanity, one of the craziest ideas I've seen in a while. Bravo.

71,71,Transferring AI To The Real World (OpenAI),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about training an AI on relatively crude computer simulations in a way that can be transferred to the real world. The problem used to demonstrate this was localizing and grasping objects. Note that this algorithm has never seen any real images and was trained using simulated data. It only played a computer game, if you will. The key observation is that using simulated training data is okay, but we have to make sure that the AI is exposed to a diverse enough set of circumstances to obtain knowledge that generalizes properly. In these experiments, the following parameters were heavily randomized: number of shapes and distractor objects on the table, positions and textures on the objects, table and the environment, number of lights, material properties, and the algorithm was even exposed to some random noise as well in the images. And it turns out that if we do this properly, leaning on the knowledge of only a few thousand images, when the algorithm is uploaded to a real robot arm, it becomes capable of grasping the correct prescribed objects. In this case, the objective was, spam detection. Very amusing. I think the very interesting part is that it is not even using photorealistic rendering and light simulations these programs are able to create high quality images.",Training an AI on Computer Simulations
72,72,New DeepMind AI Beats AlphaGo 100-0,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: The work on AlphaGo is absolute insanity. In the game of Go, the players put stones on a table where the objective is to surround more territory than the opponent. AlphaGo uses a combination of a policy network that is responsible for predicting the moves, and a value network that predicts the winner of the game after it plays it to the end against itself. This algorithm started out with a bootstrapping process where it was shown thousands of games that were used to learn the basics of Go. Some voiced their doubts within the Go community and noted that the algorithm would never be able to beat Lee Sedol, a 9-dan world champion, and winner of 18 international titles. And get this, at 40 days, this version surpasses all previous versions and defeats the previously published world-beater version 100-0. This is insanity, but if you think that's it, well, hold on to your papers now. In this newest work, AlphaGo has reached its next form, Alpha go Zero. This variant does not have access to any human played games in the first phase and learns completely through self-play. It is beautiful to see these curves as they show this neural network starting from a random initialization, but it is completely clueless about the game itself. And I am completely out of words now and I think it is fair to say that is history unfolding before our eyes.",AlphaGo Zero - The Work on AlphaGo Is Absolute Insanity

74,74,Learning to Model Other Minds (OpenAI),"Scientists at OpenAI and the University of Oxford came up with a work by the name ""Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness"", LOLA in short. This is about multiplayer reinforcement learning, if you will. This new agent does not only care about maximizing its own score but also inserts a new term into the equation which is about anticipating the actions of other players in the environment. For instance, it can learn tit for tat, which is a strategy that mirrors the other player's actions. And now comes the even cooler thing! These LOLA agents know that if the previous time, they cooperated, they will immediately give each other another chance, and again, get away with the least amount of prison time. As you can see here, the results vastly outperform other naive agents, and from the scores it seems that previous techniques enter a snitching revenge war against each other and both will serve plenty of time in prison. It is an ideal benchmark because an advanced agent would know that we cooperated the last time, so it is likely that we can partner up this time around too! And now, the first cool result is that if we run the prisoner's dilemma with two of these new LOLA agent, they quickly find the Nash equilibrium. The optimal solution of this game is when both criminals remain silent, and this strategy is something that we call the Nashilibrium.",The New LOLA Agent

77,77,Deep Learning From Human Preferences,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a collaboration between OpenAI and DeepMind's security team. The goal was to learn to perform a backflip through reinforcement learning. After around 700 human feedbacks, the algorithm was able to learn the concept of a back flip. The algorithm is still able to learning using these. binary yes/no scores, which are extremely difficult to use for any sort of learning. We provide feedback on less than 1% of the actions the algorithm makes, and it can still learn difficult concepts off of these extremely sparse and vague rewards. Low-quality teaching leads to high-quality learing. How about that!? This is significantly more complex than what other techniques were able to. learn with human feedback. And, it works with other games too! And it is incredible that the algorithm isstill able. to learn using these binary yes-or-no scores. This is a problem formulation in which humans can overlook and control the learning process, which is going to be an increasingly important aspect of learning algorithms in the future. As the media is all up in arms about the demise of the human race I feel that it is important to show the other side of the coin as well.

This is different from what we've seen a few episodes ago, where scientists at NVIDIA worked on synthesizing lip sync geometry for digital characters solely relying on audio footage. The results are also compared to the Face2face paper from last year that we also covered in the series.

80,80,Light Transport on Specular Microstructure,"Using light simulation programs, we are able to populate a virtual scene with objects, assign material models to them, and create a beautiful, photorealistic image of this digital scene. The theory of light transport follows the physics of light, therefore these images should be indistinguishable from reality. However, there are some cases when we can tell them apart from real images. The main issue is that in our mathematical models, these materials are often defined to be too perfect. In reality, metals are rarely perfectly polished, and the classical material models in light transport can rarely capture these microstructures that make surfaces imperfect. This algorithm is about rendering new material models that can represent the imperfect materials like scratched coating and metallic flakes on carpaint, a leather sofa, wooden floor, or a teapot. It is over a hundred times faster than previous techniques, has less limitations as it works on curved surfaces, and, it only takes 40% longer to render it compared to the standard perfect material models. Just look at these phenomenal images. It's truly incredible that we can create images of this sophistication using science. If you would like to learn more about light simulations, I have been holding a full master-level course on it at the Technical University of Vienna for a few years now.",Light Simulations - A New Way to Create Images of the Real World
81,81,Hindsight Experience Replay,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Hindsight Experience Replay, HER, or her in short. This algorithm takes on problems where the scores are binary, which means that it either passed or failed the prescribed task. In the video, you can see a comparison with a previous algorithm with and without the HER extension. The higher the number of epochs you see above, the longer the algorithm was able to train. The incredible thing here is that it is able to achieve a goal even if it had never been able to reach it during training. The key idea is that we can learn just as much from undesirable outcomes as from desirable ones. A really cool piece of work that could potentially open up new ways of thinking about reinforcement learning. And do you think 8 minutes of these videos is worth a dollar? If you have enjoyed this episode and your answer is yes, please consider supporting us on Patreon. Thanks for your generous support and I'll see you next time!

82,82,Latent Space Human Face Synthesis,"Generative adversarial networks are a new line of machine learning research. They can synthesize new images of animals, create 3d models from photos, or dream up new products based on our edits of an image. However, training these networks against each other is anything but roses and sunshine. We don't know if the process converges or if we reach Nash equilibrium. If you wish to hear more about the Nash-equilibrium, I've a put a link to Khan Academy's video in the description, make sure to check it out, you'll love it! I find it highly exciting that there are parallels in AI and game theory, however, the even cooler thing is that here, we try to build a system where we don't have to deal with such a situation. This is called Generative Latent Optimization, GLO in short and it is about introducing tricks to do this by only using a generator network. It is also able to perform simple arithmetic operations between any number of data points. For instance, if A is males with sunglasses, B are males without sunglasses, and C are females, then A-B+C is going to generate females in sunglasses. It can also do super resolution and much, much more, makesure to have a look at the paper in the video description.",Generative Anomalies - A New Line of Machine Learning Research
83,83,DeepMind's AI Learns Locomotion From Scratch,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new way to teach digital creatures to navigate in complex environments. The previous technique borrowed smaller snippets of movements from a previously existing database of motions and learned to stitch them together in a way that looks natural. The selling point of this new one, which you might say, looks less elaborate, however, it synthesizes them from scratch. This is amazing because it doesn't require any specialized reward function but at the same time, there are a ton of different solutions that get us far in these terrains. And as you see here, beyond bipeds, a bunch of different agent types are supported. The training process itself happens on a rich, carefully selected set of challenging levels. Make sure to have a look at the paper for details. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

84,84,What is The Best Way To Simulate Liquids?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: What matters is how the viewers perceive the end result, whether they think it looks fake, or if it keeps their suspension of disbelief. This paper provides an exhaustive user study to answer this question, where the users are asked to look at two different simulations and as a binary choice, tell us which is the one they perceived to be closer to the reference. It also turns out that after a relatively favorable breaking point which is denoted by 2x, further increasing the resolution does not make a significant difference in the user scores. But boy, does it change the computation times! So this is why such studies are super useful, and it's great to see that the accuracy of these techniques are measured both mathematically, and also how convincing they actually look for users. I think this is highly useful information for more time critical applications, so make sure to have a look at the paper for details. There are similar user studies with glossy and translucent material models and much more in the paper. The source code of this project is also available.

85,85,AI Learns To Improve Smoke Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér uses AI to create super detailed smoke simulations. One neural network is trained to capture similarities in densities, and one for vorticity. Using the two neural networks in tandem, we can take a low resolution fluid flow and synthesize the fine details on top of it in a way that is hardly believable. It also handles boundary conditions, which means that these details are correctly added even if our smoke puff hits an object. It took 9 years to do this. This is exactly 9 eternities in the world of research, which is a huge testament to how powerful the original algorithm was. It is also really cool to get more and more messages where I get to know more about you Fellow Scholars. I was informed that the series is used in school classes in Brazil, it is also used to augment college education, and it is a great topic for fun family conversations over dinner. That's just absolutely fantastic. Loving the fact that theseries is an inspiration for many of you. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

86,86,Physics-based Image and Video Editing,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you how to edit existing images and videos by adding new objects to them, or editing their physical attributes. These editable attributes include gravity, mass, stiffness, or we can even add new physical forces to the scene. For instance, we can change the stiffness of the watches in this Dalí painting and create an animation from it. Physically accurate animations from paintings. How cool is that? This is approaching science fiction levels of craziness. The biggest challenge is to make sure that the geometry and the visual consistency of the scene is preserved through these changes. There are plenty of details discussed in the paper, make sure to have a look at that, a link to it is available in the video description. As these 2D photo to 3D model generator algorithms improve, so will the quality of these editing techniques in the near future.

87,87,AI Creates 3D Models From Images,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a task that humans are remarkably good at, but learning algorithms mostly flounder. In video games and animation films, this is a scenario that comes up very often if we need a new weapon model in the game. This new technique still uses a learning algorithm to predict the geometry, but it creates these 3D models hierarchically. It starts out approximating the coarse geometry of the output, and restarts the process by adding more fine details to it. The geometry becomes more and more refined over several steps. As a result, we get 3D Models that are of higher quality than the ones offered by previous techniques. And you know the drill, research is a process, and every paper is a stepping stone. And this is one of those stepping stones that can potentially save many hours of work for 3D artists in the industry. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

88,88,AI Creates Facial Animation From Audio,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about creating facial animation from speech in real time. After recording audio footage of us speaking, we give it to a learning algorithm, which creates a high-quality animation depicting our digital characters uttering these words. This learning algorithm is a Convolutional Neural Network, which was trained on as little as 3 to 5 minutes of footage per actor, and was able to generalize its knowledge from this training data to a variety of real-world expressions and words. And if you think you've seen everything, you should watch until the end of the video as it gets better than that because of two reasons. Reason number one, it not only takes audio input, but we can also specify an emotional state that the character should express. Number two, and this is the best part, we can combine this together with DeepMind's WaveNet, which synthesizes audio from our text input. And then that sound clip can be used with this technique to make a digital character say what we've written. This way, we get a whole pipeline that works by learning and does everything for us in the most convenient way. No actors needed for voiceovers. No motion capture for animations. This is truly incredible. If you enjoyed this episode, and would like to help us make better videos in the future, please consider supporting us on Patreon.",How to Create a Face Animated Script
89,89,DeepMind's AI Learns Audio And Video Concepts By Itself,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about unsupervised learning. Algorithm is given a bunch of images, or any media, and is instructed to learn on it. There is no teacher to supervise the learning. The algorithm learns by itself. This technique not only classifies the frames of the videos, but it also creates semantic heatmaps. It looks at a man with a fiddle, listens to a sound clip and will say whether the two correspond to each other. The audio subnetwork also learned the concept of human voices, the sound of water, wind, music, live concerts and much, much more. And the answer is yes, it is remarkably close to human-level performance on sound classification. And all this is provided by the two networks that were trained from scratch, and, no supervision is required. We don't need to annotate these videos. Nailed it. And please don't get this wrong, it's not like DeepMind has suddenly invented unsuper supervised learning, not at all. This is a field that has been actively researched for decades. We rarely see really punchy results like these ones here. Truly incredible work.

90,90,Photorealistic Fur With Multi-Scale Rendering,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Creating a photorealistic image with fur and hair is hard. This work introduces a multi-scale model for rendering hair and fur. This means that it computes near and far-field scattering separately. If we render an image with 256 spp, we get a roughly equivalent quality to a previous technique using around six times as many samples. And one more thing: as these hamsters get closer or further away from the camera, we need to make sure that there is no annoying jump when we're switching models. And as you can see, the animations are buttery smooth. If you would like to learn more about light simulations, I am holding a full master-level course on it at the Technical University of Vienna. And the entirety of this course is available free of charge for everyone. Give it a go! As always, details are available in the video description.

91,91,DeepMind Publishes StarCraft II Learning Environment,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: This is a preliminary work, so please don't expect superhuman performance. To play the game, Deep Reinforcement Learning is used, which you heard about earlier in the series. The paper describes a set of minigames for the AI to learn, where the algorithm can learn different aspects of the game. And I really love the openness and the community effort on this work, which we've only just scratched the surface of given the magnitude and complexity of the problem, he says. Károley: I think it is now easy to see that starting out with throwing the AI in deep to perform well on a full one versus one match, this point, is a forlorn effort, but I'm expecting it to make a full turn at some point in the next few years. He continues with a look at the first joint paper between DeepMind and Blizzard on creating an AI program to play Stacraft II, which he says is a huge challenge to write a formidable AI for because of the three reasons. He says the AI has reached the level of a novice player, which is quite amazing given the complexity and magnitude and magnitude of the issue. Kérastor: It's way more complex than most people would think, but we'll see in a minute that it's way better than we thought.",Deep Learning in the Game of Stacraft II
92,92,Real-Time Noise Filtering For Light Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Real-time photorealistic rendering is one of the most exciting areas in computer graphics research. This is particularly useful for the film industry because we can create highly realistic scenes and set them up in a way that we couldn't do in real life. This technique performs spatiotemporal filtering. This means that we take a noisy input video and try to eliminate the noise and guess how the final image would look like. It can create almost fully converged images from extremely noisy inputs. These images with the one sample per pixel can be created extremely quickly, in less than ten milliseconds per image. And yes, you heard it right, this is finally a real-time result. This all happens through decoupling the direct and indirect effect of light sources and denoising them separately. And, no neural networks or learning algorithms have been used in this work. Super excited to see where the artists will take this, and of course, I'll be here to show you the coolest followup works.

93,93,OpenAI's Bot Beats DOTA World Champion Dendi,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: OpenAI created an AI for DOTA 2 that is so good that they challenged the best players in the world. The algorithm was trained in 24 hours, and during this time, it not only learned the rules and objectives of the game, but it also pulls off remarkable tactics, he says. Károley: In this case, the number of actions that this program performs in a minute is comparable to that of a human player. This means that these results stem from superior technical planning and not from the fact that humans with biological limitations would stand no chance against a computer program. He says the program not only won, but apparently also broke the will of Dendi, the reigning world champion, who tapped out after two matches. ""I feel like someone being hit by a sledgehammer. I didn't even know this was being worked on! This is such a remarkable achievement,"" he says, referring to OpenAI's bot. ""It's a game that is a huge challenge because unlike chess and go, it has lots of incomplete information, and even the simplified one versus one mode involves a reasonable amount of long-term planning,"" he adds, ""which is a true test for any kind of AI""",OpenAI's DOTA 2 AI
94,94,Verifying Mission-Critical AI Programs,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: The age of AI is coming, and clearly, there are possible applications of it that we need to be very cautious with. We know that in some cases, neural networks are unreliable, but it is remarkably hard to identify these failure cases. The paper discusses a way of verifying important properties of neural networks. It can measure the adversarial robustness of such a network, and this is super useful, because it gives us information about forged inputs that could break our learning systems. This is one of those incredible papers that, even without the usual visual fireworks, makes me feel that I am a part of the future. It is a step towards a future where we can prove that a learning algorithm is guaranteed to work in mission critical systems. The goal here is avoiding midair collisions between commercial aircrafts while minimizing the number of alerts. It's a small-scale ""what if"" kind of experiment that may prove to be a first step towards something really exciting. It doesn't mean that there are any sort of aircraft safety systems deployed in the industry that are relying on neural Networks. No no no, absolutely not. But in this case, such a neural network would have to be verified. And it is now finally a possibility.",The Age of AI: A New Approach to Learning
95,95,DeepMind's AI Learns Imagination-Based Planning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about the Imagination-Augmented Agents algorithm. The algorithm is based on a combination of a neural network and reinforcement learning. This algorithm works similarly to how an animal learns new things. It observes the environment, tries different actions and sees if they worked well. If yes, it will keep doing that, if not, well, let's try something else. And as you can see, this is only the first paper on this new architecture and it can already solve a problem with seven boxes. This is just unreal. And please note that this is a fairly general algorithm that can be used for a number of different problems. The paper contains more results and is a great read, make sure to have a look.

96,96,AI Learns Semantic Style Transfer,"Style transfer is an amazing area in machine learning and AI research. This first paper opened up an incredible new area of research. It is meant to do well with input image pairs that may look completely different visually, but have some semantic components that are similar. For instance, a photograph of a human face and a drawing of a virtual character is excellent example of that. In this case, this learning algorithm recognizes that they both have noses and uses this valuable information in the style transfer process. As a result, it has three super cool applications. First, the regular photo to style transfer that we all know and love. Second, it is also capable of swapping the style of two input images. Third, and hold on to your papers because this is going to be even more insane. And we have a plus one here as well, so, fourth, it also supports color transfer between photographs, which will allow creating amazing time-lapse videos. And this is one of those moments when I get super happy, because more than a 170 episodes into the series, we can not only appreciate the quality of these these new results, but we also had previous episodes about both of these algorithms. As always, the links are available in the video description, make sure to have a look. The source code of this project is also available.",Machine Learning Research - A New Way to Do Style Transfer

98,98,Animating Elastic Rods With Sound,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at a new technique that simulates the sound of virtual elastic rods made of aluminum, steel, oak tree, and rubber. The sound emerging from these elastic rods is particularly difficult to simulate because of the fact that sound frequencies vary quite a bit over time. The authors of the paper proposed a dipole model to create these simulations. It is computationally quite effective and can eliminate these lengthy pre-computation steps that are typically present in previous techniques. And of course, before you ask, this also means that there will be sound simulations of everyone's favorite toy the walking slinky. For the Fellow Scholars who are worried about the validity of these Star Wars sounds, I know you're out there, make sure to watch the video until the end. And as you know all too well, I love all papers that have something to do with the real world around us. And the reason for this is that we can try the very best kind of validation for these algorithms and this is, when we let reality be our judge.

99,99,Interactive Green-Screen Keying,"In the film industry, we can often see footage of a human walking on the Moon, fighting underwater, or appearing in any environment without actually going there. To do this, a piece of footage of the actor is recorded in front of a green screen, and then, the background of the scene is changed to something else. This process is called green-screen keying, and in theory, this sounds simple enough, but make no mistake this is a challenging problem. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains how to create a novel solution to this keying problem in the Two Minute Papers. The final results are compared to a ton of already existing methods on the market and this one smokes them all, he says. He also shows that the algorithm is not too sensitive to this choice of dominant colors, so there is room for amazing followup papers to make the process a bit more automatic.

100,100,Refocusing Videos With Neural Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains how light fields can be used to edit videos. Light field cameras can change the focal distance, or even slightly adjust the viewpoint of the camera. With some more improvements, this could be tremendously useful in the film industry, because the directors could adjust their scenes after the shooting, and not just sigh over the inaccuracies and missed opportunities.

It is also blazing fast and takes less than a tenth of a second to create one of these new views. Absolutely amazing. If we stitch all this information together in a smart way, maybe it is a possibility to get full light field editing for videos. This would be awesome, but we're not there yet. Too much information is missing. This stitching process works with a bit more information than this, and the key idea is to use two convolutional neural networks to fill in the blanks. One is used to predict flows, which describe the movements and rotations of the objects in the scene, and one to predict the final appearance.",Light Field Editing for Videos
101,101,Phace: Physics-based Face Modeling and Animation,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new way to transfer gestures onto a virtual human's face in a way that is physically correct. This means that not only the changes in the facial geometry are transferred to a digital character, but also the bone and flesh and muscle structures as well. As a result, the body mass index of a character can also be changed in both directions, slimming or fattening the face. Lip enhancement is also a possibility. If we had super high resolution facial scans, maybe a followup work could simulate the effects of botox injections. How cool would that be? Make sure to have a look at the paper for more applications, for instance, they also demonstrate the possibility of modifying the chin and the jawbone. They even have some result in simulating the effect of Bell's palsy, which is the paralysis of facial muscles on one side. Oh, my! Another glimpse of the future of computer graphics and animation.

102,102,Real-Time Hair Rendering With Deep Opacity Maps,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at a new technique that produces self-shadowing effects for hair and fur. The key idea is that if we look at the hair from the light source's point of view, we can create the new layers further and further away according to this shape. This way, the layers are not planar anymore, they adapt to the scene that we have at hand and contain significantly more useful occlusion information. I have found an implementation from Philip Rideout, the link to this is available in the video description. If you have found more, let me know and I'll include your findings in theVideo description for the fellow tinkerers out there. Thanks for watching and for your generous support.

104,104,AI Learns Visual Common Sense With New Dataset,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new endeavor to teach some more common sense to learning algorithms. The goal is to get tons of training data for these, and would be able to distinguish whether a human is showing them something, or just moving things about. The already existing video databases are surprisingly sparse in this sort of information, and in this new, freshly published dataset, we can learn on a 100,000 labeled videos to accelerate research in this direction. Some initial results with learning on this dataset are also reported to kick things off, and they seem quite good if you look at the results here, but since this was not the focus of the paper, we shouldn't expect superhuman performance. However, as almost all papers in research are stepping stones, two more followup papers down the line, this will be an entirely different discussion. I'd love to report back to you on the progress later. Super excited for that. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time. Back to the page you came from.

105,105,DeepMind's AI Learns Superhuman Relational Reasoning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new method of teaching neural networks to be capable of relational reasoning. This means that we can present the algorithm with an image and ask it relatively complex relational questions. This is something that we humans are amazingly good at, but computer algorithms are dreadful for this type of work. Some of these questions sound like ones that we would get in the easier part of an IQ test. I wouldn't be very surprised to see a learning algorithm complete a full IQ test with flying colors in the near future.

106,106,Text-based Editing of Audio Narration,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We write a piece of text, and a computer synthesized voice will read it aloud for us. This is really useful for reading the news, or creating audiobooks that don't have any official voiceovers. This work was done by researchers at Princeton University and Adobe and is about text-based audio narration editing. It solves an optimization problem where the similarity, smoothness and the pace of the original footage is to be matched as closely as possible. It is traditional in a sense that it doesn't use any sort of neural networks, however, there are great strides being made in that area as well. And due to some of these newer video and audio editing techniques, I expect that within the internet forums, fake news is going to be an enduring topic. I hope that in parallel with better and better text and video synthesis, there will be an arms race with other methods that are designed to identify these cases. And now, if you excuse me, I'll give this publicly available TTS one more try and see if I can retire from narrating videos. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time. Yep. Exact same thing. Bet you didn't even notice it.",Text Based Audio Narrative Editing
107,107,Efficient Yarn-based Cloth Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about creating stunning cloth simulations that are rich in yarn-to-yarn contact. New technique optimizes this process by only computing some of the forces that emerge from these yarns pulling each other. The good news is that this approximation is carried out with temporal coherence. This means that these contact models are retained through time and are only rebuilt when it is absolutely necessary. The regions marked with red in these simulations show the domains that are found to be undergoing significant deformation, therefore we need to focus most of our efforts in rebuilding the simulation model for these regions. And all this was done seven years ago. In research and technology, this is an eternity. This just blows my mind. The results are also compared against the expensive reference technique as well. And you can see that the differences are minuscule, but the new, improved technique offers a 4 to 5-time speedup over that. If someone would say that each of my all-nighters would now count as 5, I'd be absolutely delighted.

108,108,Iridescent Light Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about iridescence, or goniochromism. Light simulation programs can now be used to create iridescent images. The paper is about simulating this effect with microfacets, which are tiny microstructures on the surface of rough objects. This is one of the best papers in photorealistic rendering I've seen in a while, says Károley. The production quality of this paper is through the roof. The methodology, derivations, comparisons are all really crisp. I am getting more and more messages from you Fellow Scholars who tell their stories on how they chose to turn their lives around and started studying science because of this series. Wow. That's incredibly humbling, and I really don't know how to express my joy for this. I always say that it's so great to be a part of the future and I am delighted to see that some of you want to be an observer and not only as an observer. This sort of impact is stronger than the absolute best case scenario I have ever dreamed of for the series. Thanks for watching and for your generous support,. and I'll see you next time! The next episode of Two Minute Papers is on Monday, November 14th at 9pm ET.",Two Minute Papers - The Next Episode
109,109,Simulating Cuts On Virtual Bodies,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new technique for cutting 3D geometry. The new technique is able to process really complex cuts without creating new geometry. There is so much visual detail in the results that I could watch this video ten times and still find something new in there. There are also some horrifying, Game of Thrones kinda experiments in this footage. The presentation of the results and the part of the video that compares against a previous technique is absolutely brilliant. I am really itching to make some longer videos where we can go into some of these derivations and build a strong intuitive understanding of them. That sounds like a ton of fun, and if this could ever become a full time endeavor, I am more than enthused to start doing more and work on bonus videos like that.

110,110,DeepMind's AI Creates Images From Your Sentences,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a followup work to an algorithm that looks at a bunch of images and from that, it automatically learns the concept of birds, human faces or coral reefs. The downside of this method is that these images are generated pixel by pixel, and many of these pixels depend on their neighborhoods. This means that we cannot do this process in parallel, but create these new images one pixel at a time. The complexity of the new algorithm scales with the number of pixels not linearly, but in a logarithmic manner, which is basically the equivalent of winning the jackpot in terms of parallelization, and it often results in a more than 100 times speedup. The lead author, Scott Reed has also published some more amazing results on twitter as well. In these examples, we can see the evolution of the final image that is generated by the network. If we're looking for ""A yellow bird with a black head, orange eyes and an orange bill"", we're going to see much more detailed images. It is an amazing feeling to be a part of the future. And note that there is a ton of challenges with the idea, this is one of those typical cases when the idea is only the first step, and execution is king.",The New Algorithm - A New Approach to the Future
111,111,Style Transfer For Fluid Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at how an algorithm can transfer an artist's style to a fluid or smoke simulation sequence. The technique is called patch-based regenerative morphing. The animation sequences were created from 8 to 9 colorized frames, and whatever you see happening in between was filled in by the algorithm.

112,112,AI Learns To Create User Interfaces (pix2code),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created an algorithm that learns how to create graphical user interfaces and automates part of this process. The algorithm supports several different target platforms, for instance, it can give us code for iOS and Android devices. The image of the graphical user interface is learned by a classical convolutional neural network, and this text representation is learned using a technique machine learning researchers like to call Long Short Term Memory. The author also has a GitHub repository with a few more clarifications, stating that the source code of the project and the dataset will be available soon.

This year it will have its twentieth year anniversary.",Machine Learning - A New Approach to Learning
113,113,Simulating Wet Sand,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is addicted to fluid simulations. In this episode, he shows you how to solve equations that tell us how the velocity and the pressure evolves in time. The longer our simulation runs, the larger the volume of the sand becomes. This issue can be alleviated by using a finer grid, which is, as we know, extremely costly to compute, or, the authors proposed a volume fixing method to take care of this without significantly increasing the execution time of the algorithm. In the meantime, I am always delighted to see you Fellow Scholars sending over photos of yourselves proudly posing with your newly obtained shirts for the series.

114,114,Algorithmic Beautification of Selfies,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about the creation of the perfect selfie photo. This technique works the following way: we analyze the photo and try to figure out how distant the camera was when the photo was taken. Then, we create a digital model of the perspective camera and create a 3D models of the face. This is a process that mathematicians like to call fitting. The authors also uploaded an interactive version of their work online that anyone can try, free of charge.

This piece of work takes a simple 2D drawing of this interlocking structure and assembles the required pieces for us to build a 3D model from them. This drawing can be done with one of the most user friendly modeler program out there, Google SketchUp. It is remarkable to see that a novice user who has never done a minute of 3D modeling can create such a beautiful and resilient piece of furniture. Really, really nice work. Loving it.

117,117,Self-Illuminating Explosions,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Light transport is one of my favorite topics. If we wish to render a huge smoke plume, we perform something that computer graphics people call volumetric light transport. This means that a ray of light doesn't necessarily bounce off of the surface of materials, but it can penetrate their surfaces and scatter around inside of them. The explosion in this image took 13 hours and it is still not rendered perfectly. But this technique is able to solve this problem in 20 minutes, which is almost 40 times quicker. If you would like to learn even more about light transport, I am holding a Master-level course on this at the Vienna University of Technology in Austria. I thought that the teachings should not only be available for those 30 people who sit in the room, who can afford a university education. It should be available to everyone. So, we made the entirety of the lecture available for everyone, free of charge, and I am so glad to see that thousands of people have watched it, and to this day I get many messages that they enjoyed it and now they see the world differently. It doesn't have the audio quality of Two Minute Papers. However, it conjures up the atmosphere of these lectures and you can almost feel like one of the students sitting there.",Light Transport - A Master-Level Course
118,118,Simulating Liquid-Hair Interactions,"Two Minute Papers with Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. This episode is going to be ample in amazing slow motion footage.

122,122,An Efficient Scattering Material Representation,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Representing materials that you see here takes more than 25 gigabytes of storage. This technique is able to compress all this into 45 megabytes without introducing any significant perceptible difference. This improved representation not only helps easing the storage requirements of these assets, but it is also makes the rendering times more than twice as fast to process.

123,123,Deep Photo Style Transfer,"Style transfer is a magical algorithm where we have one photograph with content, and one with an interesting style. And the output is a third image with these two photos fused together. This is typically achieved by a classical machine learning technique that we call a convolutional neural network. The more layers these networks contain, the more powerful they are, and the more capable they are in building an intuitive understanding of an image. Have a look at these results. They are just right in some sense. There is an elusive quality to them. And this is the challenge! We not only have to put what we're searching for into words, but we have to find a mathematical description of these words to make the computer execute it. Just think about this, this is a really challenging question. The authors decided that the photorealism of the output image is to be maximized. One possible solution would be to stipulate that the changes in the output color would have to preserve the ratios and distances of the input style colors. But we've used one more new word here what does this regularization term mean? This means that there are a ton of different possible solutions for transferring the colors, and we're trying to steer the optimizer towards solutions that adhere to some additional criterion, in our case, the affine transformations.",Style Transfer - A New Word

132,132,Geometric Detail Transfer,"In the world of digital 3D modeling, it often occurs that we are looking for surfaces that are not perfectly smooth, but have some sort of surface detail. Metric learning is a classical technique in the field of machine learning, where we're trying to learn distances between things where distance is mathematically ill-defined. And in this work, this metric learning is used to learn the relationship between objects with and without these rich surface details. The results look absolutely amazing. I would love to use this right away in several projects. I hope some public implementations of this method will appear soon, I would be quite excited to use it right away. In the meantime, we have a completely overhauled software and hardware pipeline to create these videos.

133,133,Modeling Knitted Clothing,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a technique that can create highly detailed cloth geometries for our digital characters. We start out with dreaming up a piece of cloth geometry, and this simulator gradually transforms it into a real-world version of that. The most obvious drawback of this technique is its computation time. It was run on a very expensive system and still took several hours of number crunching to get this done.

134,134,Structural Image Editing With PatchMatch,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: PatchMatch is an algorithm that can be used to make crazy modifications to previously existing photographs. He says the algorithm works by adding additional hints to the algorithm, for instance, marking the expected shape of an object that we wish to cut out and have it filled in with new data. The whole thing happens interactively, almost in real time, but if we consider the hardware improvement since this paper was published, it is safe to say that today it runs in real-time even on a mediocre computer, he says. The technique does not use any of the modern machine learning techniques, so in the era of these incredibly powerful deep neural networks, I can only imagine the quality of solutions we'll be able to obtain in the near future.

137,137,Stable Neural Style Transfer,"Neural style transfer is an incredible technique where we have two input photographs, and the output would be a combination of these two, namely, the content of one and the artistic style of the other fused together. The first work required a powerful computer to accomplish this, and took several minutes of strenuous computation, and now, less than two years later, it's right in your pocket and can be done instantly. This extension is also capable of texture synthesis, which means that we give it a small image patch that shows some sort of repetition, and it tries to continue it indefinitely in a way that seems completely seamless. It is also important to point out that this proposed technique is also more art directable, make sure to have a look at the paper for more details on that.

It is so effective that it can turn a powerful learning algorithm into a blabbering idiot. In the future, the robustness of a learning algorithm will be just as important of a design factor as how powerful it is, Károley says. He also talks about the possibility of creating a black box system, where we know much less about the target system, but we know the game itself, and we train our own system and look for weaknesses in that.

141,141,Real-Time Fiber-Level Cloth Rendering,"This piece of work shows us how to render a piece of cloth down to the level of fibers. This is a difficult problem, because we need to be able to handle models that are built from potentially over a hundred million fiber curves. The closer we get to the cloth, the more details appear, and that it is possible to create a highly optimized algorithm that doesn't render these details when they are not visible. This could be used in many state of the art systems as-is, right now. The authors also made the cloth models available for easier comparisons in followup research works.

142,142,Shape and Material from Video,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created an algorithm to create a digital copy of an object on a robot arm. The algorithm works the following way: in the first step, we estimate the lighting and leaning on this estimation, we build a rough initial surface model. And in the second step, using this surface model, we see a bit clearer, and therefore we can refine our initial guess for the lighting. And now, feast your eyes on these incredible results, and marvel at the fact that we know next to nothing about the input, and the geometry and material properties almost magically appear on the screen. This is an amazing piece of work, and lots and lots of details and results are discussed the paper, which is quite well written and was a joy to read. Make sure to have a look at it, the link is available in the video description.

143,143,Learning to Fill Holes in Images,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a paper from 2007 that foreshadowed the power of data-driven learning algorithms. The paper shows how an algorithm can be used to fill in holes in an image with data that makes sense. The main challenge of this solution is finding similar images within the database, and fortunately, even a trivial technique that we call nearest neighbor search can rapidly eliminate 99.99% of the dissimilar images. He also discusses some of the failure cases, which arise mostly from the lack of high-level semantic information, for instance, when we have to finish people, which is clearly not what this technique is meant to do, unless it's a statue of a famous person with many photographs taken in the database.

144,144,AI Builds 3D Models From Images With a Twist,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents an algorithm that can create a digital 3D model of a room from a photograph. The algorithm uses a database that contains the geometry for publicly available furniture pieces and finds which ones are seen in the image. This entire process of creating the 3D geometry of the scene takes around 5 minutes. And this technique can also estimate the layout of the room from this one photograph.

145,145,Digital Creatures Learn to Cooperate,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents an optimization problem for digital characters. The algorithm has to come up with a series of smooth movements and contact interactions to obtain this goal. The goal does not necessarily have to be a position, but it can be an orientation or a given pose as well. It is truly incredible to see how these digital characters can learn such complex animations in a matter of minutes. A true testament to the power of mathematical optimization algorithms. If you wish to hear more about how optimization works, we've had a previous episode on this topic, make sure to check it out, it includes a rigorous mathematical study on how to make the perfect vegetable stew.

146,146,How Do Hollywood Movies Render Smoke?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: How do people create these beautiful computer generated images and videos that we see in Hollywood blockbuster movies? In the world of light simulation programs, to obtain a photorealistic image, we create a digital copy of a scene, add a camera and a light source, and simulate the paths of millions of light rays between the camera and the light sources. This technique we like to call path tracing and it may take several minutes to obtain only one image on a powerful computer. In these simulations, the rays of light are allowed to bounce off of the surface of objects. In reality, many objects are volumes, where therays of light can penetrate their surface and scatter around before exiting or being absorbed. This family of techniques we call importance sampling methods. These help us finding the regions where light is concentrated, if you will. This piece of work is an excellent new way of doing importance sampling for volumetric path tracing, and it works by identifying and focusing on regions that are the most likely to scatter light. And, it beats the already existing importance sampling techniques with ease. By the way, Marcos and his team recently won a technical Oscar award, not only for this, but for their decades of hard work on their Arnold renderer, which is behind many many Hollywood productions.",How to Do Importance Samples for Volumetric Path Tracing
147,147,Fast Photorealistic Fur and Hair With Cone Tracing,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a cone-based ray tracing algorithm for rendering photorealistic images of hair and furry objects. It works by replacing infinitely thin light rays with thicker, cone-shaped rays. The algorithm is also able to adapt the cone sizes to the scene we have at hand. The previous techniques typically took at least 20 to 30 minutes to render one image, and with this efficient solution, we'll be greeted by a photrealistic image at least four to six times quicker, while some examples were completed in less than a minute. I cannot get tired of seeing these tiny Photorealistic furry animals in Pixar movies and I am super happy to see there's likely going to be much, much more of these. The paper contains techniques to overcome this issue, and an efficient data structure is proposed to store and find the individual hair strands, and a way to intersect these cones with the fibers.

149,149,Enhance! Super Resolution From Google,"Super resolution is process where our input is a coarse, low resolution image, and the output is the same image, but now with more details and in high resolution. This particular method is not based on neural networks, but is still a learning-based technique. The technique looks at how the small and large resolution images relate to each other when viewed through the lens of these features. Two remarkably interesting things arose from this experiment: one, it outperforms existing neural network-based techniques, two, it only uses 10 thousand images, and one hour of training time, which is so little, it's completely unheard of. Really, really well done. I am hoping to see a more widespread adoption of this in future papers in this area. For now, when viewing websites, I feel that we are close to the point where we could choose to transmit only the lower resolution images through the network and perform super resolution on them locally on our phones and computers. This will lead to significant savings on network bandwidth. We are living amazing times indeed.

153,153,Deep Learning Program Hallucinates Videos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains how a machine learning technique can be used to generate new videos from scratch. The technique is based on a generative adversarial network. This means that we have two neural networks that race each other, where one tries to generate more and more real-looking animations, and passes it over to the other that learns to tell real footage from fake ones. The results in the paper show that this new technique beats the previous techniques by a significant margin, and that users have a strong preference towards the two-stream architecture. The previous technique they compare against is an autoencoder, which we have discussed in a previous Two Minute Papers episode, check it out, it is available in the video description! The synthesized results vary in quality, but it is remarkable to see that the machine can have a rough understanding of a concept and animation types. We can also visualize what the neural network has learned by finding a particular neuron that makes a particular image. Some of the results are quite horrifying, but what is sure of is that we go out and train for images of people and trains for images before we go home. And a huge shout out to László Cózmán for his work on this.",Machine Learning Techniques to Generate Videos From Scratch
154,154,Amazing Slow Motion Videos With Optical Flow,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér uses optical flow to create beautiful slow-motion footage. Optical flow is not a silver bullet and it should be used with moderation and special care. It can also introduce nasty artifacts like the one that you see here. It's just one of the coolest application of optical flows. But if we have an unmanned aerial vehicle, it's really great because it will be able to know which direction to end it in. It will also help us decide when to use an algorithm that is adaptively able to adaptively use the footage. I'd like to make it extremely sure that you don't leave this video thinking that this is the only way to make slow motion footage beautiful. You'll understand why they look the way they do at the end of the video, but by the end, it may seem disconnected from the narrative, but at first, you'll understand it's all about the video.

His work uses neural networks to solve problems that are otherwise close to impossible to tackle. The execution time of the algorithm is in the order of a few milliseconds for a reasonably sized simulation. The results look quite reassuring, even the phenomenon of a smoke puff bouncing back from an object is modeled with high fidelity. And let's not forget that this is only the first step: we haven't even talked about other kinds of physical simulations, such as collision detection, shattering glassy objects and gooey soft body simulations. I think it is truly remarkable, and I'll see you next time for your generous support and support for your next research project. I am extremely excited for this piece of work, but I am also aware that it is not the destination, but a stepping stone towards something truly remarkable and remarkable. I feel that it's important to mention my affiliation, even though my role in this project has been extremely tiny.

159,159,3D Printing Flexible Shells For Molding,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new technique for 3D printing flexible molds for objects with detailed geometry. The technique endeavors to have the least amount of cuts, and the length of the cuts is also subject to minimization. The paper discusses tons of issues that arise from this problem formulation, for instance, what one should do with the tiny air bubbles stuck in the resin. And there's a lot more, make sure to have a look! Of course, as always, we would love to hear your ideas about possible applications of this technique. Leave your thoughts in the comments section!

The last two weeks will be devoted to the ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Computer Science"" topics.",The Two Minute Papers
160,160,Multiphase Fluid Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new fluid simulation technique. The technique is an extension to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, or SPH. The visual quality of the simulation scales with the number of simulated particles. This way, it is possible to create a scene where we have instant coffee and soft candy dissolving in water. It also maps well to parallel architectures and the results shown in the video were run on a relatively high-end consumer NVIDIA card. A nice and general framework for fluid-solid interactions, dissolution, elastoplastic solids, and deformable bodies. What a fantastic value proposition. I could watch and play with these all day. I'll try my best to resist, but in case the next episode is coming late, you know where I am. The quality of this paper is absolutely top tier and if you like physics, you're going to have lots of fun reading it. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

161,161,Precomputed Deformation Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new way to simulate elastic deformations. The authors identified 3 major bottlenecks in already existing precomputation techniques. They proposed optimizations to speed them up considerably at the cost of higher memory consumption. The results of the new technique are clearly very close to the results we would obtain with standard methods. But the computation time is 20 to 2000 times less. In the more favorable cases, computing deformations that would take several hours can take less than a second. That is one jaw-dropping result and a hefty value proposition indeed. And there is a lot of other things to be learned from the paper. If you wish to support the show and get access to cool perks, like an exclusive early access program, check out our page on Patreon.

162,162,Sound Propagation With Bidirectional Path Tracing,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new algorithm to simulate sound effects in a virtual world. The algorithm is based on a technique called bidirectional path tracing. It is significantly more efficient than the classical path tracer on difficult indoors scenes. The proposed technique is built around minimizing this metric, which leads us to an idea on which rays carry important information and which ones we are better off discarding. I also like this minimap on the upper left that actually shows what we hear in this footage, exactly where the sound sources are and how they change their positions. Have a look!

163,163,Water Wave Simulation with Dispersion Kernels,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new convolution formulation of Sir George Biddell Airy's dispersion model. The resulting algorithm parallelizes and maps well to the graphical card in our computers. I expect and hope this to be useful for ocean and coastal engineering and in simulating huge tidal waves. This example took roughly one and a half second per frame to compute. You know the drill a couple more followup papers down the line, and it will surely run in real time. Can't wait!

164,164,3D Printing Acoustic Filters,"An acoustic filter is an arbitrarily shaped object that takes a sound as an input, and outputs a different sound. In this work, a novel technique is proposed to automatically design such filters. The goal can be to eliminate the peaks of the sound of a car horn or an airplane engine, and we can achieve this objective by means of optimization. This method also supports designing musical instruments with, hmm, well, non-conventional shapes. And also, that is about the most harmonious sound I've heard coming out of the rear end of a hippo. If you feel like improving your kung fu in math, there are tons of goodies such as transmission matrices, the Helmholtz equation, and oh my! The paper and the talk slides are amazingly well written, and yes, you should definitely have a look at them.

165,165,Synchronizing Animations To Sound,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér and his team have created a way to synthesize sound effects from animations. They used a pre-generated database of rigid body simulations with dozens of different objects. No machine learning is used here, if we look under the hood, we'll see a big graph that tries to group different events and motions together and encode the order of execution. This will be just spectacular for creating music videos, animated movies, and I am convinced that professional artists will be able to do incredible things with such a tool. Some limitations apply, such as the environment is constrained to be this plane that we've seen in these animations, and as always with works that are inventing something completely new it currently takes several minutes, which is not too bad, but of course, there is plenty of room to accelerate the execution times. Now hold on to your papers, and let's check out the first round of results together. Wow. I think it would be an understatement to say that they nailed it. As I am looking through the results, I am still in complete disbelief. This shouldn't be possible. And what's more, we can also add additional constraints, like a prescribed landing location to the object to make sure that the animations are not too arbitrary, but are more in line with our artistic vision.",Synthesize Sound Effects From Animations
166,166,Deep Learning Program Simplifies Your Drawings,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains the difference between raster and vector graphics. He explains how a convolutional neural network can transform a raster image into a vector image. He also explains how this technique can be used to create high-resolution images. Károley concludes with a video demonstration of this technique in action. The video is linked in the video description box in the bottom right corner of the page.

167,167,Human Pose Estimation With Deep Learning,"Pose estimation is an interesting area of research where we try to automatically extract the pose this person was taking. In this paper, a previously proposed convolutional neural network is used to predict the position of the individual joints, and curiously, it turns out that we can create a faithful representation of the 3D human body from that. The results show that this algorithm outperforms several other state of the art techniques by a significant margin. It is an auspicious opportunity to preserve and recreate a lot of historic events in digital form, maybe even use them in computer games, and I am sure that artists will make great use of such techniques. There will be lots of fun to be had indeed! Also, make sure to check out the YouTube channel of Welch Labs, who has a great introductory series for neural networks, which is in my opinion, second to none. He also has a new series called ""Learning to see"", where he codes up a machine learning technique for a computer vision application.

168,168,Computer Games Empower Deep Learning Research,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: A dataset is typically a big bunch of data, for instance, a database of written letters, digits, images of human faces, stock market data that scientists can use to test their algorithms on. To have a usable dataset, we have to label tens of thousands of these images, and as you may imagine, creating such labeled images requires a ton of human labor. So how do we create huge and accurate datasets without investing a remarkable amount ofhuman labor? Well, hear out this incredible idea: What if we would record a video of us wandering about in an open-world computer game, and annotate those images? This way, we enjoy several advantages: 1. Since we have recorded continuous videos, after annotating the very first image, we will have information from the next frames, therefore if we do it well, we can propagate a labeling from one image to the next one. 2. We don't have any of the problems that stem from using handheld cameras. Noise, blurriness, problems with the lens, and so on are all non-issues. 3. Not only that, but the algorithm also has some knowledge about the rendering process itself. This means that it looks at how the game communicates with the software drivers and the video card, tracks when the geometry and textures for a given type of car are being loaded or discarded.",How to Create Huge Datasets Without Investing a Ton of Human Labor
169,169,Building a Community Around Two Minute Papers,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér wants to create a community platform around Two Minute Papers.

170,170,How To Steal a Lost Election With Gerrymandering,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Gerrymandering is the process of manipulating electoral district boundaries to turn the tide of an election. The term originates from one of the elections in the USA in the 1800s, where Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill to reshape the districts of Massachusetts in order to favor his party. The entire process relies on a relatively faithful prediction of the vote distributions per region, which in many countries, is not really changing all that much in time. It is of utmost importance that these district boundaries are drawn by an independent organization and that the process is as transparent as possible. Please feel free to post the more interesting finding of yours in the comments section, we always have excellent discussions therein.

171,171,Real-Time Soft Body Dynamics for Video Games,"The key to real-time physically based simulations is parallelism. In software engineering, these virtual people we like call threads, or compute units. The big contribution of this piece of work is a technique to distribute the computation tasks to these compute units in a way that they are working on independent chunks of the problem. This is achieved via using graph coloring, which is typically used for designing seating plans, exam timetabling, solving sudoku puzzles and similar assignment tasks. The technique produces remarkably realistic animations and requires only 15 milliseconds per frame, which means that this technique can render over 60 frames per second comfortably. It not only works in an absolutely spectacular manner, but graph theory is an immensely beautiful subfield of mathematics, so additional style points to the authors! And the other most important factor is that this Technique is also stable, meaning that it offers an appropriate solution, even when many other techniques fail to deliver.

172,172,Generating Tangle Patterns With Grammars,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Grammars are a set of rules that tell us how to build up a structure. From grammars, we can build not only sentences, but buildings, he says. In this piece of work, we start out with an input shape, subdivide it into multiple other shapes, assign these smaller shapes into groups. And the final tangle is obtained by choosing patterns and assigning them to all of these groups. This yields a very expressive, powerful, tool that anyone can use to create beautiful tangle patterns. And all this, through the power of grammar. Thanks for watching, and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

173,173,3D Printing Materials With Subsurface Scattering,"Subsurface scattering means that not every ray of light is reflected or absorbed on the surface of a material, but some of it may get inside somewhere, and come out somewhere else. In physics, the laws of light scattering are well understood, and the wonderful thing is that instead of printing a real object, we could just use a light simulation program to tell us how close the results should be. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Imagine that many mathematicians have to study this transform without ever hearing what it can be used for. These are not some dry and tedious materials. I feel that people need to know that we can do these miracles with these inventions, and I hope you did!

They are excellent at energy absorption and resisting fracture, and are widely used in body armor design. These auxetic patterns can be cut out from a number of different materials. The method supports copper, aluminum, plastic and leather designs, and I am sure there will be mind blowing applications that we cannot even fathom so early in the process.

177,177,Sound Propagation With Adaptive Impulse Responses,"A realistic simulation of sounds within virtual environments dramatically improves the immersion of the user in computer games and virtual reality applications. To be able to simulate these effects, we need to compute the interaction between sound waves and the geometry and materials within the scene. We can use path tracing to simulate the path of many waves to obtain an impulse response, which is a simple mathematical function that describes the reverberation that we hear if we shoot a gun in a given scene, such as a space station or a church. After we obtained these impulse reponses, we can use an operation called the convolution with our input signal, like our voice to get a really convincing result. In the best cases, the algorithm executes five times as quickly as previous techniques, and the memory requirements are significantly more favorable. Limitations include a bit overly smooth audio signals and some fidelity loss in the lower frequency domains. Some of these scenes in the footage showcase up to 24 distinct sound sources, and all of them are simulated against the geometry. So let's listen together and delight in these magnificent results.

My favorite intuition is that the rank encodes the information content of the matrix. The uglier the colorscheme, the better suited it is for learning. As future work, I would propose replacing the basic mathematical operators such as addition and multiplication by machine learning. Except that it is already done and is hilariously fun, and it even supports division by zero. Talk about the almighty powers of deep learning.

179,179,WaveNet by Google DeepMind,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: WaveNet can synthesize samples in someone's voice. It also generates waveforms sample by sample, which is particularly perilous because we typically need to produce these at the rate of 16 or 24 thousand samples per second. The algorithm currently takes 90 minutes to synthesize one second of sound waveforms, but down the line, it will take only a few more minutes, it'll be real time, he says. He also predicts that artistic style transfer for sound and instruments is not only coming, but it will be here soon, and we'll be able to sing something in Lady Gaga's voice and intonation.

180,180,Automatic Hair Modeling from One Image,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Hair modeling is about trying to compute the physical forces that act on hair strands. The output results are so spectacular, it's almost as if we were seeing magic unfold before our eyes. The method is fully automatic, which means that unlike most previous works, it doesn't need any guidance from the user to accomplish this task. As a result, the authors created an enormous dataset with 50 thousand photographs and their reconstructions that they made freely available for everyone to use. The fact that we have so many hairstyles in this dataset also opens up the possibility of editing, which is always quite a treat for artists working in the industry. It is slightly ameliorated by the fact that the public repositories contain hairstyles that make sense, so we can expect results of reasonable quality even for the regions we haven't seen in the input photograph.

184,184,Neural Material Synthesis,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about two papers that help us create physically based material models from photographs that we can use in our light simulation programs. The authors ask us to grab our phone for two photographs of a material to ensure a high-quality reconstruction procedure: one with flash, and one without. In the Two-Shot Capture paper, a material model is given by how much light is reflected and absorbed by the diffuse and specular components of the material, and something that we call a normal map, which captures the bumpiness of thematerial. And it is needless to say, the presented results are absolutely fantastic. And therein lies the problem, which they tried to address in the second paper. Can we explain the same kind of understanding of materials to a computer somehow? Can we do it with only one image? And the answer is, yes we can, and, hopefully, we already feel the alluring call of neural networks. We can get a neural network that was trained on a lot of different images to guess what reflectance parameters should look like. But the output should not be one, but multiple images with multiple reflectance informations, and normal map to describe the bumpy surface of this surface. This conspiracy part of the paper is a bit like if we had 4 criminals testifying at trial where they try to sell their story and maintain their credibility.",The Two-Shot Capture Paper

186,186,What is an Autoencoder?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Autoencoder is an interesting variant of neural networks. Autoencoders are capable of creating sparse representations of the input data. They can therefore be used for image compression. There is a variant that is called the variational autoencoding that not only learns these sparse representations, but can also draw new images as well. We can, for instance, ask it to create new handwritten digits and we can actually expect the results to make sense! There is an excellent blog post from Francois Cholle, the creator of the amazing Keras library for building and training neural networks, make sure to have a look! With these examples, we were really only scratching the surface, and I expect quite a few exciting autoenCoder applications to pop up in the near future. I cannot wait to get my paws on those papers. Hopefully you Fellow Scholars are also excited! If you are interested in programming, especially in python, check out the channel of Sentdex for tons of machine learning programming videos and more.

187,187,The Science of Medal Predictions (2016 Rio Olympics Edition),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Can we predict the future? The answer is very simple: no, we can't. But we can predict what is likely to happen based on our experience of what happened so far. In mathematics, this is what we call extrapolation. There is also a big difference between trying to extrapolate the results of one athlete, or the aggregated number of medals for many athletes, usually an entire nation. The take home message is that usually the bigger the group we're trying to predict results for, the lesser the number of variables that are enough to explain their behavior. If you are interested in how the Olympic Games unfold, make sure to have a look at the Olympics reddit, I found it second to be second to the link is available in the description box. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time! I'll be back with a Two Minute Papers next time and talk about a model that was used to predict previous Olympic Games events.

If we sit down and read the paper, which is a great and very easy read and you should definitely have aLook, it's in the video Description box. I'd like to mention that we won't be showcasing any predictions for this year's Olympics. We'll see in a second.",Can We Predict the Future?
188,188,Peer Review and the NeurIPS Experiment,"In science, making sure that the validity of published results is beyond doubt is of utmost importance. Many scientific journals and conferences exist where researchers can submit their findings in the form of a science paper. As a condition of acceptance, these papers shall undergo extensive scrutiny by typically 2 to 5 other scientists. At a given prescribed acceptance ratio, there was a disagreement for 57% of the papers. This is hardly something to be proud of: the consistency of expert reviewers is significantly closer to a coinflip than to a hypothetical perfect review process. Can we do something about this? Well, of course, this is a large and difficult problem for which I don't pretend to have any perfect solutions. There is a really interesting idea by a renowned professor about crowdsourcing reviews that I found to be spectacular. I'll leave the blog post in the comments section in the both for this and the NIPS experiment, and we shall have an entire episode about this soon. Stay tuned!

190,190,What is Optimization? + Learning Gradient Descent,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér will talk about mathematical optimization. This kind of optimization means finding one, hopefully optimal solution from a set of possible solutions. An optimization problem is given the following way: one, there are variables we can play with, and two, there is an objective function that we wish to minimize or maximize. In our cooking example, after making several meals, we would ask our guests about the tastiness of these meals. From their responses, we'd recognize that adding a bit more salt led to very favorable results, and since these people are notorious meat eaters, decreasing the amount of vegetables and increasing the meat content also led to favorable reviews. This was just one toy example, but the list of applications is endless. In fact, optimization is so incredibly ubiquitous that there is hardly any field of science where some form of it is not used to solve difficult problems. This episode is also going to be a bit heavy on what optimization is and we'll talk a little bit at the end about the intuition of the paper itself. If you have any questions regarding the gradient part, we had an extended Two Minute Papers episode on what gradients are and how to use them to build an awesome algorithm for light transport. It is available, where? Well, of course, in the box, Károley, why are you even asking?",The Mathematical Optimization Podcast
191,191,Bundlefusion: 3D Scenes from 2D Videos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created a way to create a 3D computer model from video footage. The technique has a really cool effect where the 3D model is continuously refined as we obtain more and more data by walking around with our camera. The comparisons to previous works reveal that this technique is not only real time, but the quality of the results is mostly comparable, and in some cases, it surpasses previous methods. To produce the results presented in the paper, an NVIDIA TITAN X video card was used, which is currently one of the pricier pieces of equipment for consumers, but not so much for companies who are typically interested in these applications. If we take into consideration the rate at which graphical hardware is improving, anyone will be able to run this at home in real time in a few years time.

We can also observe such shapes in mother nature, for instance, in a sunflower. Fermat spirals can also be used to approximate a number of different shapes. Researchers have found that if we get a 3D printing machine and create a layered material exactly like this, the surface will have a higher degree of fairness, be quicker to print, and will be generally of higher quality than other possible shapes.

196,196,Procedural Yarn Models for Cloth Rendering,"Two Minute Papers with Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we're going to talk about a procedural algorithm. Procedural graphics is a subfield of computer graphics where information is generated on the fly. In this paper, a technique is proposed to automatically generate procedural yarn geometry. A yarn is a piece of thread from which we can sew garments. The authors extensively studied parameters in physical pieces of yarns such as twisting and hairyness and tried to match them with a procedural technique. The solutions are validated against photographs and even CT scans. The paper is a majestic combination of beautifully written mathematics and amazing looking results. Make sure to have a look!

197,197,What Can We Learn From Deep Learning Programs?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We know exactly how to train a neural network, it's just that as an output of this process, we get a model of something that resembles a brain as a collection of neurons and circumstances under which these neurons are activated. We store these in a file that can take up to several gigabytes, and the best solutions are often not intuitively understandable for us. In fact, they are so effective at it that if we you try to forcefully insert some of our knowledge in there, the solutions are going to get worse. What if we have extremely accurate algorithms where we don't know what is going on under the hood, or simpler, more intuitive algorithms that may be subpar in accuracy? If we have a top tier scientific conference where only a very limited number of papers get accepted, which ones shall we accept? I hope that this question will spark a productive discussion, and hopefully scientific research venues will be more vigilant about this question in the future. And by the way, we have talked about a fantastic paper on Neural Programmer Interpreters that also aims to complete algorithms that can be understood directly by the user. And perhaps, perhaps, this is one of the more interesting future frontiers of machine learning.",Machine Learning - The Future Frontiers of Machine Learning
198,198,Hallucinating Images With Deep Learning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about one shot learning, a technique that can learn something from one, or at most a handful of examples. In this episode, we ask the neural network to have a sentence as an input, and ask it to generate images according to it. The output images are tiny because this technique is very expensive to compute. But with the current progress in this area, I am convinced that in a few years, feeding millions of examples to a deep neuralNetwork to learn such a simple concept will be considered a crime.

199,199,Rocking Out With Convolutions,"A convolution is a mathematical technique to mix together two signals. Convolutions can be used to add reverberation to a recorded instrument. For instance, a guitar plus concert hall equals a guitar sound that was played in a concert hall. We also had many examples of convolutional neural networks that provide efficient means to, for instance, get machines to recognize traffic signs. And before we go, a quick shoutout to immersive math, a really intuitive resource for learning linear algebra. If you are into math, you simply have to check this one out, it's really cool.

It is the miracle of mathematics.",Convolutions - The Miracle of Mathematics
200,200,Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI's Gym,"Reinforcement learning is a technique in the field of machine learning to learn how to navigate in a labyrinth, play a video game, or to teach a digital creature to walk. The intuition behind the algorithm itself is incredibly simple. Choose an action, and if you get rewarded for it, keep doing it. If the rewards are not coming, try something else. The reward can be, for instance, our score in a computer game or how far our digital creature could walk. As more techniques pop up in this direction, it is getting abundantly clear that we need a framework where they can undergo stringent testing. This means that the amount of collected rewards and scores should be computed the same way, and in the same physical framework. It is usually quite difficult to learn things where the reward comes long after our action because we don't know when exactly the point was when we did something well. This is one of the reasons why Google DeepMind will try to conquer strategy games in the future, because this is a genre where good plays usually include long-term planning that reinforcement learning techniques don't really excel at. It gets more and more difficult to be the first at something. That's a great challenge for researchers. From a consumer point of view, this means that better techniques will pop up day by day. We have really exciting times ahead of us.",Reinforcement Learning - The Future of Machine Learning
201,201,Image Colorization With Deep Learning and Classification,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new technique for adding color to black and white images.

202,202,Schrödinger's Smoke,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about the Schrödinger equation. The equation is used to describe how subatomic particles behave in time. This work reformulates the equation in a way that it tracks the density and the velocity of the fluid. This way, it can be integrated in a purely grid-based, Eulerian fluid simulator, and we don't need to track all these individual particles one by one. Many questions still remain, such as how to mix different fluid interfaces together, how to model the forces between them. I do not have the prescience to see the limits of the approach, but I am quite convinced that this direction holds a lot of promise for the future. I cannot wait to play with the code and see some follow-up works on this! As always, everything is linked in the video description box.

It just boggles the mind to see that so many people are interested in learning more about awesome new research inventions, and I hope that it is as addictive to you as it was for me when I first got to see some of these results. And I must say that I am completely blown away by your loyal support. Thanks so much for each one of you, I am honored to have loyal supporters like you. It has never been about the details, it has always been about intuition. Most materials on any scientific topic on YouTube are about details. It took me four days to get a good grasp, a good high-level intuition of what is going on.

204,204,Surface-Only Liquids,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Most of the time, we can get away with not doing computations inside the volume of the fluid, but only on the surface. This surface-only technique scales extremely well compared to traditional techniques that simulate the entire volume. To make such a technique work, we have to make simplifications to the problem. This one is such a spectacular paper. It is so good, I had it on my tablet and couldn't wait to get on the train so I could finally read it.

205,205,Artistic Style Transfer For Videos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Style transfer is possible on still images. But can we apply this artistic style transfer to videos? Would it work if we would simply try? For an experienced researcher, it is flagrantly obvious that it's an understatement to say that that it wouldn't work. But with this technique, it apparently works quite well. To be frank, the results look gorgeous. So how does it work? This technique preserves temporal coherence when applying the artistic style by incorporating the optical flow of the input video. Such great progress in so little time. Loving it. Thanks for being around and I've definitely learned from you Fellow Scholars! I am really loving the respectful and quality discussions that take place in the comments section, and it is really cool that we can both learn from each other.Thanks for watching, and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

206,206,Deep Reinforcement Terrain Learning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a followup work to a technique we have talked about earlier. This time, these creatures not only learn to walk, but they also monitor their surroundings and are also taught to cope with larger terrain differences. This means that they learn both on character features, like where the center of mass is and what the velocity of different body parts are, and terrain features, such as, what the displacement of the slope we're walking up on is or if there's a wall ahead of us. One important limitation of this technique is that it is restricted to 2D, this means that the characters can walk around not in a 3D world, but on a plane. A question whether we're shackled by the 2D-ness of the technique or if the results can be applied to 3D remains to be seen. It's very clear that in this research area, enormous leaps are made year by year, and there's lots to be excited about. And please note that the technique still supports a variety of different creature setups. As more papers are published on this locomotion problem, the authors also discuss that it would be great to have a unified physics system and some error metrics so that we can measure these techniques against each other on equal footings.",The Evolution of a Locomotion Technique
207,207,Separable Subsurface Scattering,"Subsurface scattering means that a portion of incoming light penetrates the surface of a material. The lack of subsurface scattering is the reason why we've seen so many lifeless, rubber-looking human characters in video games and animated movies for decades now. This technique is a collaboration between the Activision Blizzard game development company, the University of Zaragoza in Spain, and the Technical University of Vienna in Austria. It can simulate this kind of light transport in half a millisecond per image. In one second, it can do this calculation two thousand times. The entire technique is so simple, a computer program that executes it can fit on your business card. It also seems to have appeared in Blender recently. If you would like to hear more about the details on how this algorithm works, I have put some videos in the description box. The most important message from this project, at least for me, is that it is possible to conduct academic research projects together with companies, and create results that can it to multi-million dollar computer games, but also have proven results that are useful for the scientific community. Thanks for your generous support and I'll see you next time! Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Back to the page you came from.",Subsurface Scattering - A New Approach to Computer Games
208,208,Real-Time Shading With Area Light Sources,"In computer graphics, we use the term shading to describe the process of calculating the appearance of a material. In this piece of work, a technique is proposed that can approximate these two factors in real time. The paper contains a very detailed demonstration of the difference between this and the analytical computations that give us the perfect results but take extremely long. Some of the authors of this paper work at Unity, which means that we can expect these awesome results to appear in the video games of the future. Some code and demos are also available on their website which I've linked in the description box, make sure to check them out! Thanks for watching, and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. In short, this technique is very closely matching the analytic results, but it is doing it in realtime. I really don't know what to say. We're used to wait for hours to obtain images like this, and now, 15 milliseconds per frame. What a hefty value proposition for a paper. Absolutely spectacular. Someof the results really remind me of topological calculations. It's super useful because, for instance, if we can prove that light behaves in some way when the light source has the shape of a disk, then if we're interested in other shapes, topology can help us determine whether all these enormous books full of theorems on other shapes are going to apply to this shape or not.",The Amazing Results of a Computer Graphics Technique
209,209,Deep Learning and Cancer Research,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new technique for detecting cancer cells. The technique is label-free, so it can recognize cancer cells without any intrusive changes to the samples. The proposed technique is significantly more accurate and consistent in the detection than previous techniques. It is of utmost importance that we are able to do something like this on a mass scale because the probability of curing cancer depends greatly on which phase we can identify it. To demonstrate how important early detection is, have a look at this chart of the ovarian cancer survival rates as a function of how early the detection takes place. We have talked about what each of these terms mean in a previous episode, I've put a link for that in the description box.

210,210,Face2Face: Real-Time Facial Reenactment,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new way to edit pre-recorded videos in real time. Previous techniques often resorted to copying the footage from the mouth and adding synthetic proxies for teeth. Not anymore with this one! I tip my hat to the authors, who came up with a vastly improved version of their previous method so quickly. It is probably needless to say that the ramifications of such an existing technique are far reaching, and are hopefully pointed in a positive direction. However, we should bear in mind that from now on, we may be one step closer to an era where a video of something happening won't be taken as proper evidence. I wonder how this will affect legal decision-making in the future. Thanks for watching, and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

211,211,Training Deep Neural Networks With Dropout,"A neural network is a machine learning technique that was inspired by the human brain. We can train it on input and output pairs like images, and descriptions, whether the images depict a mug or a bus. When we provide the unknown images, it falters and almost never gets the answer right. This is the problem of overfitting, and intuitively, it is a bit like students who are not preparing for an exam by obtaining useful knowledge, but students who prepare by memorizing answers from the textbook instead. But no worries, because we have dropout, which is a spectacular way of creating diligent students. It gives the average of a very large number of possible neural networks, and we only have to train one network that we cripple here and there to obtain that. It indeed teaches slacking students how to do their homework properly. Please keep in mind using dropout also leads to longer training times, my experience has been between 2 to 10x, but of course, it heavily depends on other external factors. So it is indeed true that dropout is slow compared to training one network, but it is blazing fast at what it actually approximates. It is training an exponential number of models.

212,212,Narrow Band Liquid Simulations,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows off a new way of simulating fluids. The new technique uses only one million particles, and creates closely matching results. It also takes approximately half as much time to run the simulation, and uses half as many memory. I see a flood of amazing fluid papers coming in the near future and I'm having quite a bit of trouble containing my excitement. Exciting times are ahead indeed.

213,213,No Such Thing As Artificial Intelligence,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Arguments about AI are not about the algorithms they seem to be discussing, but about the very definition of AI, which is ill-defined at best. He argues that AI is imagined to be a mystical thing that only exists in the future, or it may exist in the present, but it has to be, in some way, shrouded in mystery. If we have a shaky definition of artificial intelligence, it is quite possibly pointless to argue whether self driving cars can be deemed artificially intelligent or not, he says. He says that using this knowledge, we can easily defuse such futile arguments.

215,215,The Dunning-Kruger Effect,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: The Dunning-Kruger effect tells us so much about people. People from the bottom 10 percent, the absolute worst performers are convinced that they were well above the average. Competent people, on the other hand, seemed to underestimate their skills. The more skilled we are, the more adept we are at estimating our skill level, he says. By gaining more competence, incompetent people also obtained the skill to recognize their own shortcomings, he adds. The results of this paper solidify the argument that we need to be very vigilant about our own shortcomings. This knowledge endows you with a shield against ignorance. Use it wisely, Károley says.

The concept is very simple: you choose an artistic style, you make a terrible drawing, and it creates a beautiful painting out of it. Some of these neural art results are so good that we should be creating a new class of Turing tests for paintings. As always, these techniques are new and heavily experimental, and this usually means that they take quite a bit of time to compute. If these works are worthy of further attention, and I definitely think they are, then we can expect great strides towards interactivity in followup papers very soon. I am really looking forward to it and we Fellow Scholars will have a ton of fun with these tools in the future. Thanks for watching, and for your generous support, andI'll see you next time! Károley.

220,220,How DeepMind's AlphaGo Defeated Lee Sedol,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: AlphaGo played and defeated Fan Hui, a 2 dan master and European champion player in the game of Go. He says the game has a stupendously large search space that makes it completely impossible to check every move and choose the best. The technique learns at a large number of games by amateurs, he says, but the question is how it can get beyond the level of amateurs? He says AlphaGo will play millions of games against itself and learn from them, to be able to solve a number of different problems without making significant changes to its algorithm. He concludes: ""Nothing in this algorithm is specific to Go. It can be used to solve any problem at any level"" and ""It is a wonderful testament of the power of mathematics and science"" and the potential of artificial intelligence to help people in their everyday lives in a variety of ways. ""It's incredible! Just as people who don't speak a word of Chinese can write an artificial intelligence program to recognize handwritten Chinese text, someone who hasn't played more than a few games can write a chess or Go program that is beyond the skill of most professional players,"" he says.

224,224,Interactive Photo Recoloring,"Image and color editing is an actively researched topic with really cool applications. Most of the existing solutions are either easy to use but lack in expressiveness, or they are expressive, but too complex for novices to use. Computation time is also an issue as some of the operations in Photoshop can take more than a minute to carry out. For color editing, the workflow is very simple, the program extracts the dominant colors of an image, which we can interactively edit ourselves. The technique executes really quickly, opening up the possibility of not real time, but interactive recoloring of animated sequences. Or, you can also leverage the efficiency of the method to edit not one, but a collection of images in one go. The paper contains a rigorous evaluation against existing techniques. For instance, they show that this method executed three to twenty times faster than the one implemented in Adobe Photoshop.

225,225,Deep Learning Program Learns to Paint,"In a previous episode, we discussed how a machine learning technique could paint in the style of famous artists. In this follow up paper, the authors use a very deep 19-layer convolutional network that they mix together with Markov random fields. The resulting algorithm retains the important structures of the input image significantly better than the previous work. If any of you are in the mood of doing some neural art of something Two Minute Papers related, make sure to show it to me, I would love to see that. In summary, the results are nothing short of amazing. I was full of ecstatic glee when I've first seen them. This is insanity, and it's only been a few months since the initial algorithm was published. I always say this, but we are living amazing times indeed. The most exciting thing about research is making something possible that was previously impossible If the work is worthy of attention, it does'nt matter if it's slow. Tree followup papers later, it will be done in a matter of seconds.

227,227,Should You Take the Stairs at Work? (For Weight Loss),"Scientists found that ascending 11 stories of staircases burns a whopping 19.7 kilo calories. Each step is worth approximately one tenth of a kilo calorie if we're ascending. The authors diplomatically noted: Stair-climbing exercise using a local public-access staircase met the minimum requirements for cardiorespiratory benefits and can therefore be considered a viable exercise for most people. If you are looking for a refreshing cardiovascular exercise in the morning that refreshes your body, and makes you happier, start climbing. I do it all the time and I love it!

228,228,What is Impostor Syndrome?,"High achieving people can suffer from impostor syndrome. Researchers, academics and high achieving women are especially vulnerable to this condition. Treatment includes group sittings where the patients discuss their lives and come to a sudden realization that they are not alone and this this not an individual case but a common pattern among high achieving people. They are also very keen on dismissing praise and kind words, and try to take in all the nourishment they get from their colleagues. These are the more common ways to treat this serious condition that poisons so many people's minds. For instance, Hayden Christensen, the actor playing Anakin Skywalker in the beloved Star Wars series appears to suffer from very similar symptoms. He said: ‘If this time away is gonna be damaging to my career, then so be it. If I can come back afterward and claw my way back in, then maybe I’ll feel like I earned it’“I don't even know what to do with this amount of time I saved reading the simple definition first. However funny as it may sound, this is a very real problem. Nothing can be convince me that I am not an imposter who fooled everyone else for being a bright person.” “I didn't want to go through life feeling like I was just riding a wave.""",Impostor Syndrome - A Common Symptom of Impostor Syndrome
229,229,Biophysical Skin Aging Simulations,"Scientists at the University of Zaragoza came up with a biophysically-based model that opens up the possibility of simply specifying intuitive parameters like age, gender, skin type. The idea is the following: you specify intuitive inputs like age and skin type, then run a detailed simulation once, that creates these diffusion profiles that you can use forever in your rendering program. And all this is done in a way that isBiophysically impeccable. I was sure that there was some potential in this topic, but when I first saw these results, they completely crushed my expectations. Excellent piece of work! Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. The faithful simulation of human skin is incredibly important both in computer games, the movie industry, and also in medical sciences. As we age, the outermost layer of our skin, the epidermis thins, the melanine, haemoglobin and water concentration levels drop over time. In this image, above, you can see a rendered image and the diffusion profiles of a 30 and an 80 year old person. The appearance of our face is strongly determined by the underlying structure ofOur skin. It becomes thinner and more dry, while the concentration of chromophores, the main skin pigments diminishes.",The Biophysical Simulation of Human Skin
230,230,Extrapolations and Crowdfunded Research (Experiment),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains the concept of extrapolation. He explains the difference between a logarithm function and a very conservative root-based growth. He also explains how to use crowdsourcing to fund research projects. He concludes with a question about how much money a startup can expect to raise for research in 2016, and the answer is 7.4 million dollars. It is possible to find out why we had wildly varying results from extrapolating the same data set over several years, but only if we take into account the fact that we had 4 samples, that means 4 dots. It seems that the further we go, the more we get the following about, we've been talking about, and it's a good idea to plot these possible functions that we're talking about. It's a simple idea, but it can lead to hilariously wrong results. It will make sense in the end, I promise! Back to Mail Online home.

Go is an ancient chinese board game where the opposing players try to capture each other's stones on the board. An elite pro  player and European champion Fan Hui was challenged to play AlphaGo and got defeated in all five matches they played together. In March, the algorithm will play a world champion. The rate of improvement in artificial intelligence research is accelerating at a staggering pace. The only question that remains is not if something is possible, but when it will become possible.

235,235,Interactive Editing of Subsurface Scattering,"Subsurface scattering means that a portion of light that hits a translucent material does not bounce back from the surface but penetrates it and scatters many-many times inside the material. Subsurface scattering looks unbelievably beautiful, but at the same time, it is very expensive because we have to simulate up to thousands and thousands of scattering events for every ray of light. With this technique, you can really create the materials you thought up in a fraction of the time of the classical workflow. Here is another interactive editing workflow where you get results instantaneously, and the result with this technique is indistinguishable from the real deal, which would be re-rendering this result image every time some adjustment is made.

238,238,Designing Cities and Furnitures With Machine Learning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Algorithm learns user preferences, then creates and recommends a set of solutions that are expected to be desirable. In this example, we are looking for tables with either one leg or crossing legs. It should also be properly balanced, therefore if we see any of these criteria, we'll assign a high score to these models. These are the preferences that the algorithm should try to learn. The algorithm also works on buildings, and after learning our preferences, it can populate entire cities with geometry that is in line with our artistic vision. The orange bars show the predicted score for new models created by the algorithm a larger value means that the system expects the user to score these high, and the blue bars mean the uncertainty. It's super cool that it is aware how horrendous these designs looks. It may have a better eye than many of the contemporary art curators out there. And we see exactly what were looking for novel, balanced table designs with one leg and crossed legs.

239,239,9 Cool Deep Learning Applications,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Machine learning provides us an incredible set of tools. If you have a difficult problem at hand, you don't need to hand craft an algorithm for it. It finds out by itself what is important about the problem and tries to solve it on its own. In many problem domains, they perform better than human experts. Some of these algorithms find out things that could earn you a PhD with 10 years ago. These results are only from the last few years, and it's really just scratching the surface. There are literally hundreds of more applications we haven't even talked about. I am eager to see, and perhaps, be a small part of this progress indeed. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!""Two Minute Papers"" is a weekly, offbeat look at what's happening in the world of science and technology. The next two weeks of Two Minute Papers will feature a look at some of the latest developments in the field of machine learning.

240,240,Neural Programmer-Interpreters Learn To Write Programs,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about new breakthroughs in machine learning research. This work is based on a recurrent neural network, which tries to learn not one something but a sequence of things. In this example, it learns to add two large numbers together. It can also learn how to rotate images of different cars around to obtain a frontal pose. And, as we can see, it can deal with a variety of problems. I am absolutely spellbound by this kind of learning, because it really behaves like a novice human user would: looking at what experts do and trying to learn and understand the logic behind their actions.

243,243,How Do Genetic Algorithms Work?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Genetic algorithms help us solve problems that are very difficult, if not impossible to otherwise write programs for. For instance, in this application, we have to build a simple car model to traverse this terrain. The farther it goes, the better the car is, and the goal is to design the best car you possibly can. A genetic algorithm then creates a new set of solutions, however, now, not randomly. It respects a rule that we call: survival of the fittest. Which means the best existing solutions are taken and mixed together to breed new solutions that are also expected to do well. Like in evolution in nature, mutations can also happen, which means random changes are applied to the DNA code of a solution. We know from nature that evolution works extraordinarily well. It's quite delightful for a programmer to see their own children trying vigorously and succeeding at solving a difficult task. Even more so if the programmer wouldn't be able to solve this problem by himself. I have also coded up a version of Roger Alsing's EvoLisa problem where the famous Mona Lisa painting is to be reproduced by a computer program with a few tens of triangles. This would be quite difficult for humans, but apparently a genetic algorithm can deal with this really well.",Genetic Algorithms Help Us Solve Problems
244,244,Randomness and Bell's Inequality [Audio only],"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Randomness is the lack of any patterns and predictability. He says a coinflip is not random because it doesn't happen by chance, and it is possible to predict. quantum-level effects happen according to the physics of extremely small things, and we again, find behaviors that seem completely random, he says. He concludes that we lose out on some details and generality because of the fact that we use intuitive words to discuss results as opposed to the original derivation with the original theory. On our imaginary hands, the wonders of the world, created by the minds of humans, should definitely be among the most interesting to us. And please note that we should definitely note that. we use the intuitive words ""wonderful"" and ""awesome"" to discuss these results, not by the hands of humans but by the. minds of the humans, who should definitely. be among this list of wonders among the world's wonders, but not by humans, but by. the minds. of the human minds, who can't do it. The Two Minute Papers is a weekly, off-beat look at the latest in science and technology. This week's topic is the role of the Internet in society and technology in society.",The Wonders of the World
245,245,Automatic Parameter Control for Metropolis Light Transport,"Metropolis Light Transport simulates rays of light that connect the camera to the light sources in the scene and compute the flow of energy between them. It simulates the path of millions and millions of rays that will eventually clean up our image. The key insight is that in a difficult scene we often experience that a completely random ray is very likely to be invalid. This insight, with two other simple metrics gives us all the knowledge we need to decide whether a scene is easy or difficult, and the algorithm tells us what mixture of the two sampling techniques we exactly need to use to get beautiful images quickly. The more complex light transport algorithms get, the more efficient they become, but at the same time, we're wallowing in parameters that we must set up correctly to get adequate results quickly. This way, an algorithm that doesn't take any parameters. You just fire it up, forget a good employee to work smart, when a dumb solution with a lot of firepower is better. And, it was tested on a variety of scenes and optimal settings. Implementing this technique is remarkably easy, someone who is familiar with the basics of light transport can do it in less than half an hour. Thanks for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.",Metropolis Light Transport - The Best Way to Get Beautiful Images
246,246,Artificial Superintelligence [Audio only],"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We may end up with an intelligence explosion, which means a possible exponential increase in capabilities. He says we need something more than the crude approximation of the human brain that we can simulate on a computer. Recursive self-improvement means that we tell the program to instead of work on an ordinary task like do better image recognition, we would order it to work on improving its own intelligence, he says. He adds: We wouldn't know if it would do it, but if it is capable of doing it, it is quite alarming, which is why Elon Musk compares creating an artificial superintelligence to ""summoning the demon"", and he offered 10 million dollars to research a ""summer of superintelligence"" He concludes with an argument on how to curb such a superintelligence if one recognizes it is no good to say it is a good thing to say to a person who is doing it to you.

247,247,Are We Living In a Computer Simulation?,"Nick Bostrom argues that at least one of the three propositions is true: almost all advanced civilizations go extinct before achieving technological maturity. There is a strong convergence among technologically mature civilizations in that none of them are interested in creating ancestor simulations. And here's the bomb we are living in a simulation. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: I'd love to hear what you think about these things. If you feel like it, leave your thoughts in the comments below. Thanks for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! I'll be back next week with a new Two Minute Papers episode. I've put a link in the description box. As always, I've also linked to a video on this here from Kurzgesagt. It's a very sad case, and even though there is research on the fact that war is receding there's a clear trend that we have less warfare than we've had hundreds of years ago. It is still possible that humanity eradicates itself before before reaching technological maturity, we have an even more powerful argument that maybe all civilizations do. And my personal opinions, conclusion. I'd go with the second. They are still not general enough, which means that they are good at doing something, like the deep blue is great at chess, but not really useful for anything else.",The Biggest Threat to Humanity
248,248,Google DeepMind's Deep Q-Learning Superhuman Atari Gameplays,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Algorithm can learn to play games the same way as a human would. He says the complaint that this is not real intelligence because it doesn't know the concept of a ball or what it is exactly doing is absurd. He adds that the algorithm doesn't have long-term memory, and even if it had, it wouldn't be able to generalize its knowledge to other similar tasks. Károley: I am perfectly happy with effective algorithms. We use these techniques to accomplish different tasks, and they are really good problem solvers.

249,249,Terrain Traversal with Reinforcement Learning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Reinforcement learning is a technique that can learn how to play computer games, or any kind of activity that requires a sequence of actions. In this case, we would like a digital dog to run, and leap over and onto obstacles by choosing the optimal next action. It is quite difficult as there are a lot of body parts to control in harmony. The algorithm has to be able to decide how to control leg forces, spine curvature, angles for the shoulder, elbow, hip, and knees. If it has learned everything properly, it will come up with exactly the same movements as we'd expect animals to do in real life! So this is how reinforcement learning works: If you do well, you get a reward, and if you don't you get some kind of punishment. These rewards and punishments are usually encoded in a score, which is a number that indicates how well you're doing. If your score is increasing, you know you've done something right and you try to self-reflect and analyze the last few actions to find out which of them were responsible for this positive change. The score would be, for instance, how far the dog could run on the map without falling, and at the same time, and it also makes sense to minimize the amount of effort to make it happen.",How to Play Computer Games With Reinforcement Learning
250,250,How Does Deep Learning Work?,"A neural network is a very loose model of the human brain that we can program in a computer. A key concept of neural networks is that they create an inner representation of the data model and try to solve the problem in that space. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: The study of knot theory, which is the study of tangling and untangling objects is a lot of snarky comments for being too exciting or too exciting for being well, or blowing your mind. The study is very heavily academic, but it can actually help us study the kinds of problems that we may encounter in the future, he says. He ends with a look at a 1 dimensional example to better understand what's going on with a 1D neural network, and the problem becomes the 1D equivalent of the original, and if we have the freedom to do this transformation, we can easily encounter cases where the data is very severely tangled and we don't know how good our best solution is to get to the bottom of the problem. He concludes by looking at a 2D example to show how a deep neural network can be used to solve problems in the real world, and how it can be more effective than a simple neural network in the field of machine learning.",A New Neural Network - A New Approach to Machine Learning
251,251,Recurrent Neural Network Writes Music and Shakespeare Novels,"Artificial neural networks are very useful tools that are able to learn and recognize objects on images. With recurrent neural networks, we can have a one-to-many relation between the input and the output. The input would still be an image, but the output would not be a word, but a sequence of words, a sentence that describes what we see on the image. It is also capable of learning the source code of the Linux operating system and generate new code that also looks quite sensible. It can also try to continue the song ""Let it Go"" from the famous Disney movie, Frozen. Or, it can write its own grooves after learning from other people's works.

If we would like to see how digitally modeled objects would look like in real life, we would create a 3D model of the desired scene, assign material models to the objects within, and use a photorealistic rendering algorithm to finish the job. We can get rid of this by simulating the paths of millions and millions of rays that will eventually clean up our image. This process: where a noisy image gets clearer and clearer -we call convergence.",Metropolis Light Transport - A New Approach to Light Transport
253,253,Building Bridges With Flying Machines,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about flying machines that can tie knots. The machines can create some crazy knots: from single to multi-round-turn hitches, knobs, elbows, round turns and multiple rope knobs. Each individual flying machine will hold one rope, therefore they have to pass through given control points at the strictly given time and a target velocity. These little guys also have to know the exact amount of force they need to exert on the structure to move into a desirable target position. And these structures are not just toys. The resulting bridges are resilient enough for humans to use. This work is a great example to show that the technology of today is improving at an incredible pace. If we can solve difficult collaborative control problems such as this one just think about the possibilities.. What an exciting time it is to be alive!

258,258,Simulating Breaking Glass,"Researchers at UC Berkeley have managed to crack this nut by creating an algorithm that uses more computational resources only around regions where cracks are likely to happen. This new technique enables the simulation of tearing for a variety of materials like cork, foils, metals, vinyl and it also yields physically correct results for glass. Here's an example of a beaten-up rubber sheet from their simulation program compared to a real-world photograph. It's really awesome that you can do something on your computer in a virtual world that has something to do with reality. It is impossible to get used to this feeling, it's so amazing. And what's even better since it is really difficult to know in advance how the cracks would exactly look like they have also enhanced the directability of the simulation, so artists could change things up a bit to achieve a desired artistic effect. In this example they've managed to avoid tearing a duck in two by weakening the paths around them. Bravo!

260,260,Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér explains what the huge deep learning rage is all about. This graph depicts a neural network that we build and simulate on a computer. It is a very crude approximation of the human brain. The first layer for an image consists of edges, and as we go up, a combination of edges gives us object parts. A combination of object parts yield objects models, and so on. This kind of hierarchy provides us very powerful capabilities. For instance, in this traffic sign recognition contest, the second place was taken by humans, but what's more interesting, is that the first place was not taken by human, it was taken a by a neuralNetwork algorithm.

262,262,Fluid Simulations with Blender and Wavelet Turbulence,"How can we simulate the motion of fluids and smoke? If we had a block of plastic in our computer program and we would add the laws of physics it would immediately start behaving like water. In these simulations we're mostly interested in the velocity and the pressure of the fluid. This we need to compute in every point in space, which would take an infinite amount of resources. And this is where Wavelet Turbulence comes into play. We know exactly what frequencies are lost and where they are lost. This technique enables us to synthesize this information and add it back very cheaply. This way one can get really detailed simulations at a very reasonable cost. It really makes a great difference. It is no accident that the technique was a technical Oscar award. Among many other systems it is implemented in Blender so anyone can give it a try. Make sure to do so because it's lots of fun. The paper and the supplementary video is also available in the description box.

This method uses a generative adversarial network, where we have a neural network for pose estimation, and a generator network to create new footage when given a test subject and a new posture. It is one of the first papers on this problem and it is already doing incredibly well. Just the way I like it. Two followup papers down the line and we'll be worried that we can barely tell the difference from authentic footage. And now, let the age of AI- based dance videos begin. The episode is sponsored by patreon.com/TwoMinutePapers, where you can pick up really cool perks, like early access to these videos, voting on the order of future episodes, and more. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! The next Two Minute Papers will be on November 14th and 15th at 10:30am ET on CNN.com and 11:00am EST on CNN TV.com.

267,267,NVIDIA Vid2Vid: AI-Based Video-to-Video Synthesis!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: New algorithm transforms edge maps into human faces, not only that, but it also animates them in time. The temporal coherence of this technique is second to none, which means that it remembers what it did with past images and doesn't do anything drastically different for the next frame. This work uses two discriminator neural networks, one checks whether the images look good one by one, and one more discriminator for overlooking whether the sequence of these images would pass as a video. Note that this pix2pix algorithm was published in 2017, a little more than a year ago. I think that is a good taste of the pace of progress in machine learning research. Up to 2k resolution, 30 seconds of video, and the source code is available. Congratulations folks, this paper is something else.

268,268,DeepMind's New AI Diagnoses Eye Conditions,"Machine learning algorithms can make our lives easier, and fortunately, some of them are also useful for serious medical applications. Medical imaging is commonly used in most healthcare systems where an image of a chosen set of organs and tissues is made for a doctor to look at and decide whether medical intervention is required. These methods can process orders of magnitude more of these images than humans, and after that, the final decision is put back into the hands of the doctor, who can now focus more on the edge cases and prioritize which patients should be seen immediately. This work from scientists at DeepMind was trained on about 14 thousand optical coherence tomography scans, this is the OCT label you see on the the left, these images are cross sections of the human retina. We first start our with this OCT scan, then, a manual segmentation step follows, where a doctor marks up this image to show where the most relevant parts, like the retinal fluids or the elevations of retinal pigments are. Now that we have the segmentation map, it is time to perform classification. This means that we look at this map and assign a probability to each possible condition that may be present. Finally, based on these, a final verdict is made whether the patient needs to be urgently seen, or just a routine check, or perhaps no check is needed.",Machine Learning Algorithms for Medical Imaging
269,269,Should an AI Learn Like Humans?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér's paper reveals us a fundamental difference between how humans and machines learn. Humans are remarkably good at reusing knowledge, and reading and understanding visual cues. However, if the visual cues become more cryptic, their performance drastically decreases. This is a remarkable property of learning algorithms, as they don't only think in terms of visual cues, but in mathematics and probabilities. Removing similarity information throws the machines off a bit, which is understandable, because the same objects may appear as if they were completely different. There is more analysis on this in the paper, so make sure to have a look. So, it is the perfect time to nourish your mind with a paper. Make sure to click it in the video description and give it a read. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! The paper contains a lot more insights.

270,270,This Painter AI Fools Art Historians 39% of the Time,"Style transfer is a mostly AI-based technique where we take a photograph, put a painting next to it, and it applies the style of the painting to our photo. A key insight of this new work is that a style is complex and it can only be approximated with one image. One image is just one instance of a style, not the style itself. The technique was tested by human art history experts, and they not only found this method to be the most convincing of all the other style transfer methods, but also thought that the AI-produced paintings were from an artist 39% of the time. So this means that the algorithm is able to learn the essence of an artistic style from a collection of images. This is a huge leap forward. It can also deal with HD videos at a reasonable speed of 9 of these images per second. The results are very convincing I feel that in most cases, it represents the art style really well and can decide where to leave the image content similar to the input and where to apply the style so the overall outlook of the image remains similar. Make sure to have a look at the paper that also describes a new style-aware loss function and differences in the training process of this method as well.

272,272,"Neural Material Synthesis, This Time On Steroids","With this technique, we can take a photograph of a desired material, and use a neural network to create a digital material model that matches it that we can use in computer games and animation movies. We can import real world materials in our virtual worlds, if you will. As you see in the comparisons here, it produces results that are closer to the ground truth than previous techniques. Note that there are some highly scattering materials that this method doesn't support, for example, fabrics or human skin. But since producing these materials in a digital world takes quite a bit of time and expertise, this will be a godsend for the video games andAnimation movies of the future.

It can also enhance the voice of the speaker at the same time. A key advantage of this architecture and training method is that this is speaker-independent, therefore we don't need specific training data from the speaker we want to use this on. The paper also contains an excellent demonstration of this concept by taking a piece of footage from Conan O'Brien's show where two comedians were booked to talk over each other. The result is a performance where it is near impossible to understand what they are saying, but with this technique, we can hear both of them one by one, crystal clear.

282,282,This Curious AI Beats Many Games...and Gets Addicted to the TV,"Reinforcement learning is a learning algorithm that chooses a set of actions in an environment to maximize a score. Intrinsic rewards are designed to come to the rescue, so the AI would be able to completely ignore the in-game score and somehow have some sort of inner motivation to drive an AI to complete a level. A key finding of this paper is that we can endow the AI with a very human-like property curiosity. This will drive the learner to favor actions that lead to unexplored regions and complex dynamics in a game. In Pong, when the agent plays against itself, it will end up in long matches passing the ball between the two paddles. How about Super Mario? Well, the agent is very curious to see how the levels continue, so it learns all the necessary skills to beat the game. The agent learned to play the game better than agents trained to maximize the (clipped) extrinsic reward directly. We think this is because the agent gets attracted to the difficult-to-predict flashing of the scoreboard occurring after the strikes. With a little stretch one could perhaps say that this AI is showing signs of addiction. I wonder how it would do with modern mobile games with loot boxes? But, we'll leave that for future work now.",Reinforcement Learning - A Game-Changing Approach to Learning
283,283,This AI Learns Acrobatics by Watching YouTube,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has developed a new way to create lifelike animations. The technique uses OpenAI's Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to find the best motions. It can also adapt to challenging new environments, or, get this, it can even work from a single photo instead of a video by completing the motion seen within. However, the Gangnam style dance still proves to be too hard, and the technology is not there yet. It works the following way. First, we take an input photo or video, and perform pose estimation on it. This is still a per-frame computation, and you remember that this doesn't give us temporal consistency. This motion reconstruction step ensures that we have smooth transitions between the poses. And now comes the best part: we start simulating a virtual environment, where a digital character tries to move its body parts to perform these actions. If we do this, we can not only reproduce these motions, but also continue them. It is quite robust so much so, that we can throw a bunch of boxes against the AI, and it still can adjust to it. These motions can be retargeted to different body shapes. You can see as it is demonstrated here quite aptly with this neat little nod to Boston Dynamics.",OpenAI - A New Way to Create Lifelike Animations
284,284,Building a Curious AI With Random Network Distillation,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows how a curious AI can solve Montezuma's revenge. The harder it is for the AI to guess what will happen, the more excited it gets to perform an action. This drives the agent to finish the game and explore as much as possible because it is curious to see what the next level holds. This work also introduces a technique, which the authors call random network distillation. It makes our neural network immune to the noisy TV problem from our previous episode, where our curious, unassuming agent would get stuck in front of a TV that continually plays new content. We'd also like to send a big thank you to Insilico Medicine for supporting this video. They use AI for research on preventing aging, believe it or not, and are doing absolutely amazing work. Make sure to have a look at the paper in the video description for more details. And hold on to your papers, because it can not only perform well in the game, but this AI is able to perform better than the average human. And again, remember that no ground truth knowledge is required, it was never demonstrated to the AI how one should play this game. Very impressive results indeed, and you see, the pace of progress in machine learning research is nothing short of incredible.",Machine Learning Research - Montezuma's Revenge

This subfield is only a few years old and has seen a number of amazing papers style transfer for HD images, videos, and some of these forgeries were even able to make professional art curators think that they were painted by a real artist. The authors also experimented applying this to video. In my opinion, the results are incredible for a first crack at this problem.

288,288,DeepMind’s Take on How To Create a Benign AI,"When creating a new AI to help us with a task, we have to somehow tell this AI what we consider to be a desirable solution. Scientists at DeepMind just published a paper on this topic, where they started their thought process from two assumptions: “For many tasks we want to solve, evaluation of outcomes is easier than producing the correct behavior” In short, it is easier to yell at the TV than to become an athlete. If you have a look at the paper, you will see a ton more details on how to do this efficiently and a case study with a few Atari games. Also, since this has a lot of implications pertaining to AI safety and how to create aligned agents, an increasingly important topic these days, huge respect for DeepMind for investing more and more of their time and money in this area.

290,290,6 Life Lessons I Learned From AI Research,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Life lessons I learned from ai research. You need an objective to train a neural network. New objectives require new strategies. If the objective was wrong, do not worry, and aim again! Have a look at AlphaGo. This is DeepMind’s algorithm that was able to defeat some of the best players in the world in the game of Go. Zooming out and evaluating experiences is immensely important, because this is where the real learning happens. And while we are here, I can simply not resist adding two more lessons from other scientific disciplines. So, lesson number five: If you find something that works, hold on to it! This is what Metropolis does, which is a light simulation that is able to create beautiful images for extremely difficult problems. However, when it finds something that is challenging to find, it is finally able to find the light, even when it is difficult to evaluate. And this is exactly what DeepMind's amazing Deep Q-Learning algorithm does that took the world by storm as it was able. to play Atari Breakout on a superhuman level just by the pixels of the pixels.

291,291,This AI Produces Binaural (2.5D) Audio,"Binaural or 2.5D audio means a sound recording that provides the listener with an amazing 3D-ish sound sensation. It produces a sound that feels highly realistic when listened to through headphones, and therefore, using a pair is highly recommended for this episode. A deep convolutional neural network is used to look at both the video and the single-channel audio content in our footage, and then, predict what it would have sounded like were it recorded as a binaural signal. The fact that we can use the visual content as well as the audio with this neural network, interestingly, also enables us to separate the sound of an instrument within the mix. Let’s listen to a few results. In this study, this new method performed better than previous methods, and in the second setup, users were asked to name the directions they hear the different instrument sounds coming from. Looking forward to a future where we can enjoy all kinds of video content with this kind of immersion. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

292,292,What Makes a Good Image Generator AI?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: NVIDIA’s amazing work that was able to dream up high-resolution images of imaginary celebrities. In the next episode, we will talk some more about their newest work that does something like this, and is even better at it, believe it or not. And for now, while we marvel at these outstanding results, I will quickly tell you about overfitting and what it has to do with images of celebrities. Overfitting is like the kind of student we all encountered at school who is always very good at memorizing the textbook but can’t solve even the simplest new problems on the exam. This is not learning, this is memorization! Overfitting means that a neural network does not learn the concept of dogs or cats, it just tries to memorize this database of images and is able to regurgitate it for us, but its knowledge cannot generalize for new images. That's not good. I want intelligence, not a copying machine! So at this point, it is probably clearer what images of Celebrities have toDo with overfitting. So, how do we know that this algorithm doesn't just memorize the celebrity image dataset it was given, and can really generate new, imaginary people? Is it the goodkind of student, or the lousy student?",The New NVIDIA Work That Can Dream Up High-Resolution Images of Imaginary Celebrities
293,293,None of These Faces Are Real!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Scientists at NVIDIA published an amazing work not so long ago that was able to dream up high-resolution images of imaginary celebrities. He says the algorithm is able to learn the properties and features of a human face and come up with truly novel human beings. He adds that the resolution of the output images is limited by the on-board video memory on the graphics card that is being used and should improve over time as new graphics cards are developed with more memory.

294,294,DeepMind’s AlphaStar Beats Humans 10-0 (or 1),"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: DeepMind has created an AI that can play Starcraft 2. The AI, AlphaStar, won the first game 7 minutes in, noting that in-game time is a little faster than real-time. AlphaStar can also see the whole map at once, but it is not given more information than what its units can see. In our next episode, you will see how this is even possible, so I hope you are subscribed to the series. We will fire up the second game, in the meantime, few interesting details. The goal of setting up the details of this algorithm was that the number of actions performed by the AI roughly matches a human player, and hopefully it still plays as well, or better. In the end, there are times when it performs more actions than humans and this may enable playstyles that are not accessible for human players. However, note that many times it also does miraculous things with very few actions. The reaction time of the AI is set to 350ms, which is quite slow. That’s excellent news because this is usually a common angle of criticism for game AIs. In other words, it sees exactly what a human would see if the human would move the camera around, but very quickly.",Starcraft 2 AI - DeepMind AI
295,295,AI Learns Real-Time Defocus Effects in VR,"In virtual reality, defocus effects are especially important because they mimic how the human visual system works. To accomplish this, a convolutional neural network is used, and our seasoned Fellow Scholars know that this means that we need a ton of training data. A neural network that successfully learned the concept of occlusions and depth by looking at random scenes. As virtual reality applications are on the rise these days, this technique will be useful to provide a more immersive experience for the users. And to make sure that this method sees more widespread use, the authors also made the source code and the training datasets available for everyone, free of charge, so make sure to have a look at that and run your own experiments if you’re interested.

296,296,OpenAI - Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about OpenAI’s new technique that teaches a robot arm to dexterously manipulate a block to a target state. In this project, they did one of my favorite things, which is, first, training an AI within a simulation, and then, deploying it into the real world. The knowledge that it has obtained is so general that we can change even the geometry of the target object and the machine will still be able to manipulate it correctly. I would not be surprised if this accuracy exceeds the capabilities of an ordinary human, given that it can perform this many times within a second. Now, I always read in the comments here on Youtube that many of you are longing for more. If you are also looking for some answers, we are now trying out a sponsorship for a great recommendation for none exist. The book Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom is a little slow for you, but it addresses all of these questions really well.

The new method is robust, which means that it works perfectly all the time. It is short, does not involve a lot of branching decisions, and is therefore an excellent candidate to run on state of the art graphics cards. The video shows fun physical simulations that utilize this technique, but no objects are imploding, although this extremely drunk dragon is showing a formidable attempt at doing that.

299,299,AI-Based 3D Pose Estimation: Almost Real Time!,"Pose estimation means that we have an image or video of a human as an input, and the output should be, this skeleton that you see here that shows us what the current position of this person is. It has a huge swath of applications, for instance, many of you often hear about motion capture for video games and animation movies, but it is also used in medical applications for finding abnormalities in a patient’s posture, animal tracking, understanding sign language, pedestrian detection for self-driving cars, and much, much more. The main idea in this paper is that it works out the poses both in 2D and 3D and contains neural network that can convert to both directions between these representations while retaining the consistencies between them. This makes all the difference. In the age of rapidly improving hardware, these are already fantastic results both in terms of quality and performance, and not only the hardware, but the papers are also improving at a remarkable pace. What a time to be alive. I hope nobody is going to install a system in my lab that starts beeping every time I slouch a little, but I am really looking forward to benefitting from these other applications.

He says that the main point of this work is not to solve Chess, or any of these games. Its main point is to show that a general AI can be created that can perform on a superhuman level on not one, but several different tasks at the same time, he says. The evaluation section in the paper is out of this world, so make sure to have a look in the video description and I am convinced that nearly any question one can possibly think of is addressed there.

He says scientists at the Google AI lab raised the issue that the reviewers themselves should also be reviewed. The authors propose a 7-point document to evaluate the quality of reviews. They also argue that reviewers should be incentivized and rewarded for their work. The paper is a short, easily readable 5-page that is very readable, but also requires money, but this also requires funds from the authors. It is available for download from the Google Play Store.

303,303,This Experiment Questions Some Recent AI Results,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about image classification using bag of words. Bag of words works by looking for keywords in a document and by using those, trying to find out what the writing is about. BagNet produces surprisingly similar results to a state-of-the-art neural network by the name ResNet. This has several corollaries. It means that neural networks are great at identifying objects in scrambled images, but humans are not. The other, more controversial corollary is that some results that show the superiority of deep neural networks over the good old bag of features come not from using a superior method, but from careful fine-tuning. There is a lot to say about this topic and we have only scratched the surface, so take this as a thought-provoking idea that is worthy of further discussion. Really cool work, I recommend it.

306,306,DeepMind: The Hanabi Card Game Is the Next Frontier for AI Research,"Scientists at DeepMind claim that Hanabi is the next frontier in AI research. The game is a card game where two to five players cooperate to build five card sequences. This is also an imperfect information game, which means the players don’t have all the knowledge available needed to make a good decision. Like in many of the best games, these simple rules conceal a vast array of strategies, all of which are extremely hard to teach to current learning algorithms. The goal is not to get a computer program that plays Hanabi well, the goal is to get an AI to learn to communicate effectively and work together towards a common goal. In the paper, a free and open source system is proposed to facilitate further research works and assess the performance of currently existing techniques. The difficulty level of this game can also be made easier or harder at will from both inside and outside the game. You can also run it yourself at home and train some of these agents on a consumer graphics card. Nobody wants to spend millions of dollars to play card games at work, so the final goal of DeepMind is to reuse this algorithm for other applications where even we, humans falter. I have included some more materials on this game in the video description, make sure to have a look.

307,307,Google’s PlaNet AI Learns Planning from Pixels,"PlaNET is a technique that is meant to solve challenging image-based planning tasks with sparse rewards. A key difference with this technique against classical reinforcement learning is that this one uses models for the planning. This means that it does not learn every new task from scratch, but after the first game, whichever it may be, it will have a rudimentary understanding of gravity and dynamics, and it will be able to reuse this knowledge in the next games. As a result, it is often 50 times more efficient than the previous technique that learns from scratch. And second, it can look at as little as five frames of an animation, which is approximately one fifth of a second worth of footage…that is barely anything and it is able to predict how the sequence would continue with a remarkably high accuracy, and, over a long time frame. This is an excellent paper with beautiful mathematical formulations, I recommend that you have a look in the video description. The source code is also available free of charge for everyone, so I bet this will be an exciting direction for future research works, and I’ll be here to report on it to you.

310,310,"Beautiful Gooey Simulations, Now 10 Times Faster","The animations were created using the Material Point Method, or MPM in short. MPM is a hybrid simulation method which is able to simulate not only substances like water and honey, but it can also simulate snow, granular solids, cloth, and many-many other amazing things. The technique has multiple stages, uses multiple data structures in many of them, and often we have to wait for the results of one stage to be able to proceed to the next. As a result, this granulation scene has more than 6.5 million particles on a very fine grid and can be simulated in only around 40 seconds per frame. And not only that, but the numerical stability of this technique is also superior to previous works, and it is thereby able to correctly simulate how the individual grains interact in this block of sand. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the number of particles, grid resolutions, and the amount of computation time needed to simulate each time step. I am currently in the middle of a monstrous fluid simulation project and oh man, I wish I had these numbers for the computation time. Look at that heavenly gooey thing.

He argues that we shouldn't try to rebuild the mind, but try to build a method that can capture arbitrary complexity and scale it up with hardware. We will talk about this method in more detail in this series of Two Minute Papers. And here comes the bitter lesson: OpenAI will be able to come up with a relatively simple neural network with so little prior knowledge that it is able to write articles that sound remarkably remarkably lifelike. The bitter lesson comes here in the way that we teach machines how to understand, simplify, and even generate text, even if it is only a few words or phrases. We are going to talk about how much easier it is for engineers to maintain and improve a simpler system in this area of research, and we haven’t even talked about the hardware scaling smarts, and how much it is possible to make the system even more powerful. We’ll talk about the way in which OpenAI can come up in the future with a much simpler neural network, and the way we can teach machines to understand and generate text in a similar way to humans.

312,312,Why Are Cloth Simulations So Hard?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: 70-80% of the total time taken to perform the simulation is spent with doing collision handling. The collision computation part is now up to 9 times faster, and if we look at the cloth simulation as a whole, that can be made over 3 times faster. As you see here, this is especially nice because we can test how these garments react to our manipulations at 8-10 frames per second. Most of the time, only a small subregion of the simulated cloth undergoes deformation due to response forces, and this knowledge can be kept track of. This knowledge contributed to cutting down the simulation time significantly. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! The next Two Minute Papers will be on February 14th and 15th at 10:30am and 11:00am. The next episode will be about the glory and the woes of cloth simulation programs.

314,314,How Do Neural Networks Memorize Text?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a paper about recurrent neural networks. These are neural network variants that are specialized to deal with sequences of data. For instance, processing and completing text is a great example usage of these recurrent networks. Here you can see with the green rectangles which previous letters these recurrent neural Networks memorize when reading and completing our sentences. The paper is even more interactive, meaning that you can also add a piece of text here and see how the GRU network processes it. It is possible for two models that work quite differently to have a very similar accuracy and score on these tests. The author argues that we should look beyond these metrics, and look at this kind of connectivity information as well. This way, we may find useful pieces of knowledge, like the fact that GRU is better at utilizing longer-term contextual understanding. A really cool finding indeed, and I am sure this will also be a useful visualization tool when developing new algorithms and finding faults in previous ones. Love it.

317,317,How To Train Your Virtual Dragon,"Scientists at the Seoul National University in South Korea wrote a great paper on teaching an imaginary dragon all kinds of really cool aerobatic maneuvers. This is all done by a reinforcement learning variant, where the AI has to continuously choose the character’s actions to maximize a reward. In this case, the big goal is following the trajectory with some more additional constraints, which, by itself, turned out to be too difficult to learn with these traditional techniques. Instead, the agent realizes, that if it tracks its own progress on a set of separate, but smaller subgoals, such as tracking its own orientation, positions, and rotations against the desired target states, it can finally learn to perform these amazing stunts. That sounds great, but how is this done exactly? This is done through a series of three steps, where step one is generation. Second is evaluation, where it has to judge these individual alternatives and find the best ones. And third, learning, which means looking back and recording whether these judgments indeed put the learner in a better position. Isn’t this amazing? I mentioned earlier that this kind of problem formulation is intractable without self-regulated learning, and you can see here how a previous work fares on following these trajectories.",How to Train a Dragon
318,318,DeepMind's AI Learned a Better Understanding of 3D Scenes,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about an AI that can decompose a 3D scene into its individual elements in a meaningful manner. This is typically one of those tasks that is easy to do for humans, and is immensely difficult for machines. The main motivation to create such an algorithm was to have an AI look at some gameplay of the Starcraft 2 strategy game and be able to recognize all individual units and the background without any additional supervision. I really hope this also means that DeepMind is working on a version of their StarCraft 2 AI that is able to learn more similarly to how a human does, which is, looking at the pixels of the game.

319,319,AI Learns Tracking People In Videos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has developed an AI technique that can identify objects in videos. The method is self-supervised and can even get close to supervised methods. It can also deal with momentary occlusions and is ready to track objects that rotate over time. However, all this greatness comes with limitations. Even though it does extremely well, it also plateaus, meaning that we don’t see a great deal of improvement if we add more training data. Now whether this is because it is doing nearly as well as it is humanly, or computerly possible, or because a more general problem formulation is still possible remains a question. I hope we find out soon. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Back to Mail Online home. Back to the page you came from.

321,321,OpenAI Five Beats World Champion DOTA2 Team 2-0!,"OpenAI Five is an AI that plays DOTA2, a multiplayer online battle arena game with a huge cult following. In match 1, right after picking the roster of heroes, the AI estimated its win probability to be 67%, so it was quite a surprise that early on it looked like OpenAI’s bots were running around aimlessly. Over time, we found out that it was not at all the case it plays unusually aggressively from the get-go and uses buybacks quite liberally at times when human players don’t really consider it to be a good choice. Later, it became clearer that these bots are no joke: they know exactly when to engage and when to back out from an engagement with the smallest sliver of health left. At the event, it was also such a joy to see such a receptive audience that understood and appreciated the high-level plays. And now, watch this video to see if OpenAI's confident move was justified! See if you can beat OpenAI Five! You’ll have to wait until the end of the video to find out if the AI is able to beat a human team in a best of 3 series.

322,322,This Robot Throws Objects with Amazing Precision,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is the lead author of a paper on robot throwing. The AI can perform 500 tosses per hour. It has to understand how to grasp an object with a given geometry. It also has to take into consideration the air resistance of a given object as well. After 14 hours of training, it achieves a remarkable accuracy, and it can restart itself without human help when it runs out of objects to train. The results look amazing, and note that this problem is much harder than most people would think at first. It is not about intelligence, it is about learning the underlying dynamics of object throwing, and not just found some good solutions via trial and error. It's a great time to be alive!

323,323,This is How Google’s Phone Enhances Your Photos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created a new way to create super resolution images. The method doesn’t use neural networks or any learning techniques, and is orders of magnitude faster than those while providing higher-quality images. In fact, get this, this is the method behind Google’s magical Night Sight and Super-Res Zoom features that you can access by using their Pixel 3 flagship phones. The entire process takes only a 100 milliseconds to process a really detailed, 12 megapixel image, which means that it can do it 10 times every second. These are interactive framerates, and it seems that doing this in real time is going to be possible within the near future. Huge congratulations to Bart and his team at Google for outmuscling the neural networks. And now, hold on to your papers, because this method does not use neural Networks or any Learning techniques. And I'll see you next time for your generous support and I'll show you the next time I'll be in Hungary.

324,324,Should AI Research Try to Model the Human Brain?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: AI research has come a long-long way in the last few years. He says there is a debate as to which research direction is the most promising going forward. He argues that with two well thought out changes, the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning may be drastically improved. Károley: Using episodic memory, which stores previous experiences to help estimate the value of different actions, not only improves the efficiency, but there is the potential for it to improve the learning of humans and animals alike. And it is beneficial to let the AI implement its own reinforcement learning algorithm, a concept often referred to as “learning to learn” or “ meta reinforcement learning” This helps obtaining more general knowledge that can be reused across tasks, further improving the efficiency. Here you see a picture of an fMRI and some regions of the brain that are marked with yellow and orange. What could these possibly mean? Well, these could hold the key to implementing a very similar neural structure within the brain to implement a similar reinforcement learning scheme within the human brain to improve its efficiency. And there is also the potential to use these structures to hold the keys to the learning to learn of real humans and real animals alike, because these could be very similar to neural structures that hold on your brain.",Deep Reinforcement Learning - The Future of AI Research
325,325,NVIDIA’s AI Transformed My Chihuahua Into a Lion,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new technique for image translation. The algorithm can translate an image of a different class of animal into a different one. It can do this translation with previously unseen object classes. You can even try it yourself through this web demo which works on pets, so make sure to read the instructions carefully, and, let the experiments begin! In fact, due to popular request, let me kick this off with Lisa, my favorite chihuahua. I got many tempting alternatives, but worry not, in reality, she will stay as is. I was also curious about trying a non-traditional head position, and as you see with the results, this was a much more challenging case for the AI. The paper also discusses this limitation in more detail. I am hoping that you will also try your own pets and as a Fellow Scholar, you will flood the comments section here with your findings. Strictly for science, of course. If you’re doing deep learning,Make sure to look into Lambda GPU systems. Lambda offers workstations, servers, laptops, and a GPU cloud for deep learning. You could save up to 90% over AWS, GCP, and Azure GPU instances.",Deep Learning - A New Technique For Image Translation
326,326,DeepMind Made a Math Test For Neural Networks,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: A paper from DeepMind is about taking a bunch of learning algorithms and torturing them with millions of classic math questions to find out if they can solve them. I wonder what kind of math questions would an AI find easy to solve? What percentage of these can a good learning algorithm answer today? Worry not, we’ll discuss some of the results at the end of this video. These kinds of problems are typically solved by recurrent neural networks that are able to read and produce sequences of data. To even begin to understand what the question is here, an AI would have to understand the concept of functions, variables, arithmetic operators, and of course, the words that form the question itself. It has to learn planning and precedence, that is, in what order do we evaluate such an expression, and it has to have some sort of memory, in which it can store the intermediate results. A neural network model that goes by the name Transformer network produced the best results by being able to answer 50% of the questions. This you find in the extrapolation column. When you look at the interpolation column, you see that it successfully answered 76%. So which one is it, 50% or 76%? Actually, both.",DeepMind: A Paper From DeepMind
327,327,How Can This Liquid Climb?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér will show you how to simulate ferrofluids. These are fluids that have magnetic properties and respond to an external magnetic field. In a simulation, we can finally do things that would be either expensive, or impossible in the real life, so let’s do exactly that! In the simulation we can also experiment with arbitrarily-shaped magnets. The information density in this example is just out of this world. And of course, it takes a team to create such a work, so congratulations to all three authors, this is one heck of a paper. Check it out in the video description. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! It is about Libo Huang, the first author of this paper.

329,329,All Hail The Mighty Translatotron!,"Scientists at Google just released the Translatotron. This is an AI that is able to translate speech from one language into speech into another language. However, there is another twist, perhaps an even bigger one, believe it or not. This technique can not only translate, but can also perform voice transfer, so it can say the same thing using someone else’s voice.

This is useful for medical applications, such as detecting issues with motor functionality, fall detection, or we can also use it for motion capture for our video games and blockbuster movies. To achieve this, this work contains two key elements. Element number one is the pose2pose network that takes an input posture and the button we pushed on the controller, and creates the next step of the animation. The pose2frame architecture then blends this new animation step into an already existing image. The neural network that performs this is trained to create these character masks in a way that is continuous and doesn’t contain jarring jumps between the individual frames, leading to smooth and believable movements.

331,331,"OpenAI's MuseNet Learned to Compose Mozart, Bon Jovi and More","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is the co-founder of OpenAI, a company that develops AI systems. In this video, he shows how a general learning algorithm can be used to compose music. Listen as the AI starts out from the first 6 notes of a Chopin piece and transitions into a pop style with a bunch of different instruments entering a few seconds in. The algorithm is also not without limitations as it has difficulties pairing instruments that either don’t go too well together or there is lacking training data on how they should sound together. I think these techniques are either already so powerful, or will soon be powerful enough to raise important copyright questions, and we’ll need plenty of discussions on who really owns this piece of music.

332,332,"Artistic Style Transfer, Now in 3D!","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows off a new technique for style transfer. Previously, style transfer could only be done in 2D, but this new method can do it in 3D. The new technique is 1000 times faster and can produce 100 frames per second using a whopping 4K resolution. It also gives us the opportunity to control the amount of flickering in the animation. It is now a proper tool to help artists perform this 3D style transfer and create these rich virtual worlds much quicker and easier in the future. And what you’ve seen here today is just one paper down the line from the original work, and we can do 4Kresolution at a 100 framesper second. Unreal.

333,333,This AI Makes The Mona Lisa Come To Life,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a learning-based method that is able to take just a handful of photos, and use those to synthesize a moving virtual character. Not only that, but it can also synthesize these faces from new viewpoints that the AI hasn’t seen before. This we refer to as 1-shot learning. If all it needs is really just one photo, this means that we can use famous photographs, and even paintings, and synthesize animations for them. The underlying laws are the same, only the style of the output is different. Absolutely amazing. The paper also showcases an extensive comparison section to previous works, and, as you see here, nothing really compares to this kind of quality. The authors also released a statement on the purpose and effects of this technology, which I’ll leave here for a few seconds for our interested viewers.

335,335,Rewrite Videos By Editing Text,"With WaveNet and its many variants, we can also learn someone’s way of speaking, write a piece of text and make an audio waveform where we can impersonate them using their own voice. With this amazing new technique, what we can do is look at the transcript of a talking head video, remove parts of it or add to it. This technique produces both the audio and a matching video of this person uttering these words. It works by looking through the video collecting small sounds that can be used to piece together this new word that we’ve added to the transcript. The motivation for this work was mainly to enhance digital storytelling by removing filler words, potentially flubbed phrases or retiming sentences in talking head videos. And of course, as it is not easy to measure the quality of these results in a mathematical manner, a user study was made where they asked some fellow humans which is the real footage, and which one was edited.

339,339,"AI Creates Near Perfect Images Of People, Dogs and More","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new technique for generating high-resolution images. This new technique uses a latent space, which means that instead of thinking in pixels, it thinks more in terms of these features that commonly appear in natural photos. It can rapidly generate new images with the size of approximately a thousand by thousand pixels. It also describes how this method is able to generate more diverse images than previous techniques and how we can measure diversity at all because that is no trivial matter.

340,340,This AI Learns About Movement By Watching Frozen People,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at how machine learning can be used to create depth maps. The depth maps are used to apply effects to an image that require knowledge about the distance of the objects within. A new paper from scientists at Google Research attempts to perform this, but, with a twist. The twist is that a learning algorithm is unleashed on a dataset of what they call mannequins. The goal is that the algorithm would have a look at these frozen people and take into consideration the parallax of the camera movement. This means that the objects closer to the camera move more than other objects that are further away. If we train our AI properly, it will be able to predict the depth maps of people that are moving around, even if it had only seen these frozen manenequins before. This method may open up the possibility of creating video versions of these amazing portrait mode images with many of the newer smartphones people have in their pockets. It is still there with the new method, especially for the background, but the improvement on the human part of the image is truly remarkable.

342,342,3D Style Transfer For Video is Now Possible!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Style transfer is an interesting problem in machine learning research where we have two input images, one for content, and one for style. The process goes as follows: we take a few keyframes from the video, and the algorithm propagates our style to the remaining frames of the video. This method does this magic through building a set of guide images, for instance, a mask guide highlights the stylized objects, and sure enough, we also have a temporal guide that penalizes the algorithm for making too much of a change from one frame to the next one.

346,346,DeepMind’s New AI Dreams Up Videos on Many Topics,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at a state of the art image generation technique from DeepMind. The technique uses a pair of neural networks that battle each over time to master a task. It also learned the concept of changes in the camera view, zooming in on an object, and understands that if someone draws something with a pen, the ink has to remain on the paper unchanged. The paper contains all the details that you could possibly want to learn about this algorithm, in fact, let me give you two that I found to be particularly interesting: one, it does not get any additional information about where the foreground and the background is, and is able to leverage the learning capacity of these neural networks to learn these concepts by itself. And two, it doesn’t generate the video frame by frame sequentially, but it creates the entire video in one go. That’s wild. For now, let's applaud DeepMind for this amazing paper, and I can't wait to have a look at more results and see some followup works on it. What a time to be alive!

347,347,This AI Hallucinates Images For You,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created a new way to synthesize images using machine learning. The technique uses a concept of latent spaces to find paths in the images that relate to intuitive concepts like camera zooming, rotation or shifting. This new work can perform that, and not only that, but it is also able to learn the concept of color enhancement, and can even increase or decrease the contrast of these images. It is not perfect in a sense that we can indeed zoom in on the picture of this dog, but the posture of the dog also changes, and it even seems like we’re starting out with a puppy that grows up frame by frame. However, as you see, we are now one step closer to not only having an AI that synthesizes images for us, but one that does it exactly with the camera setup, rotation, and colors that we are looking for. What a time to be alive! If you wish to see beautiful formulations of walks…walks in latent spaces, that is, make sure to have a look at the paper in the video description. Also, note that we have now appeared on instagram with bite-sized pieces of our bite- sized videos. Yes, it is quite peculiar.

This is why every video ends with what you’re coming with, with every episode ending with what the next episode is coming with. We’ve seen in the previous years that neural network-based learning methods are amazing at image classification, which means that after training on a few thousand training examples, they can look at a new, previously unseen image and tell us whether it depicts a frog or a bus. A new paper discusses whether we should look at these adversarial examples as bugs or not, and of course, does a lot more than that! It argues that most datasets contain features that are predictive, meaning that they provide help for a classifier to find cats, but also non-robust.",Two Minute Papers With Károly Zsolnai-Fehér
350,350,This AI Clears Up Your Hazy Photos,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about a new method that can subdivide an image into a collection of layers.

You see here the left image, this is the source person, the video on the right is the target video, and our task is to transfer not just the gestures, but the pose, gestures and appearance of the face. And, this new method works like magic. It not only works likemagic, but pulls it off on a surprisingly large variety of cases, many of which I haven't expected at all.",Face2Face - A New Technique That Transfers More Than Just Gestures
352,352,This is How You Simulate Making Pasta,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows us how thin, elastic strands interact with oil paint, mud, melted chocolate, and pasta sauce. These amazingly detailed simulations can be done on a grid of surprisingly low resolution. As a result, our simulations also needn’t be so tiny in scale with one hair strand and a few drops of mud or water. The fact that we can simulate this at all is a miracle, and a potential implementation on the graphics card could yield us significant speedups.

353,353,These Are The 7 Capabilities Every AI Should Have,"Scientists at DeepMind published a learning algorithm that they called deep reinforcement learning. This technique is a combination of a neural network that processes the visual data that we see on the screen, and a reinforcement learner that comes up with the gameplay-related decisions. This paper sparked quite a bit of mainstream media interest, and provided fertile grounds for new followup research works to emerge. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Measuring and comparing is an important part of research and is absolutely necessary so we can compare new learning methods more objectively. Now note that there is a lot more to this paper, if you have a look at it in the video description, you will also find the experiments that are part of this suite, what makes a good environment to test these agents in, and that they plan to form a committee of prominent researchers to periodically review it.

354,354,OpenAI’s GPT-2 Is Now Available - It Is Wise as a Scholar!,"OpenAI GPT-2 is a learning-based technique which can perform common natural language processing operations. The AI reads 40 gigabytes of internet text, which is 40 gigs of non-binary plaintext data. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér tried to frame it as an exam question and was not disappointed be the results. The results were absolutely amazing and show that it can be wise as a scholar, and it can also cheat like nobody’s business. The size of this model is about 750 million parameters. It is only half of the size of the original full model, which was expected to be even better. For now, for now, OpenAI for now for users alike, and a big thank you Daniel King and the Hugging Face company for this super convenient public implementation. Let the experiments begin! Thanks for your generous support and I'll see you next time! I'll be watching and the next time you'll see this next time, you'll be able to see it yourself! I love it. I'm stunned.

For instance, here you can see that one can train it on many source code files on GitHub and it will be able. to complete the code that we write on the fly.",OpenAI GPT-2 - A Learning-Based Technique
355,355,Google's AI Plays Football…For Science!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Reinforcement learning is an important subfield within machine learning research. This enables these AIs to play Atari games at a superhuman level, control drones, robot arms, or even create self-driving cars. In the meantime, the Google Brain research team has also been busy creating a physics-based 3D football, or for some of you, soccer simulation where we can ask an AI to control one, or multiple players in this virtual environment. In this environment, we can also test our reinforcement learning agents against handcrafted, rule-based teams. For instance, here you can see that DeepMind’s Impala algorithm is the only one that can reliably beat the medium and hard handcrafted teams, specifically, the one that was run for 500 million training steps. This will not only help researchers to train and test their own reinforcement learning algorithms on a challenging scenario, but they can extend it and make up their own scenarios. Now note that so far, I tried my hardest not to comment on the names of the players and the teams, but my will to resist just ran out. Go real Bayesians!

359,359,AI Learns Human Movement From Unorganized Data,"The goal here is also to learn something meaningful from lots of barely labeled human motion data. Barely labeled means that a bunch of videos are given almost as-is, without additional information on what movements are being performed in these videos. The number of frames contained in the original dataset is very scarce. To alleviate this, the authors decided to augment this dataset, which means trying to combine parts of this data to squeeze out as much information as possible. As a result of this augmented dataset, it can learn to perform zombie, gorilla movements, chicken hopping, even dribbling with a basketball, you name it. What’s even more, we can give the AI high-level commands interactively, and it will try to weave the motions together appropriately. They can also punch each other. Ow. What a time to be alive!

360,360,OpenAI Plays Hide and Seek…and Breaks The Game!,"OpenAI built a hide and seek game for their AI agents to play. Over time, the hiders learned to lock out the seekers by blocking the doors off with these boxes and started winning consistently. When playing a different map, a seeker has noticed that it can use a ramp to climb on the top of a box, and, this happens. Do you think couchsurfing is cool? Give me a break! This is box surfing! And, the scientists were quite surprised by this move as this was one of the first cases where the seeker AI seems to have broken the game.

In the last few years, we have seen DeepMind’s AI defeat the best Go players in the world. Now, DeepMind embarked on a journey to defeat pro players in Starcraft 2, a real-time strategy game. This is a game that requires a great deal of mechanical skill, split-second decision making and we have imperfect information as we only see what our units can see. The previous version of AlphaStar we covered in this series was able to beat at least mid-grandmaster level players. This new version can now play all three races, and here you see its MMR ratings, a number that describes the skill level of the AI, and for non-experts, win percentages for each individual race. One of the coolest parts of the work, in my opinion, is that this kind of exploitation is a general concept that will come to be used in general. Glorious Glorious! This is just one example of using exploiters to create a better AI, but surely you will see a lot more of this in the coming years.",DeepMind AI - The New Version of AlphaStar
371,371,This AI Creates A Moving Digital Avatar Of You,"This week, Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you how to build a 3D hair simulation system.

372,372,OpenAI Safety Gym: A Safe Place For AIs To Learn,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Reinforcement learning is a technique in the field of machine learning to learn how to navigate in a labyrinth, play a video game, or to teach a digital creature to walk. In reinforcement learning, if the rewards are not coming we have to try something else. In this paper, OpenAI introduces what they call the constrained reinforcement learning formulation, in which these agents can be discouraged from performing actions that are deemed potentially dangerous in an environment. The goal of this project is that in the future, for reinforcement learning algorithms, not only the efficiency, but the safety scores should also be measured.

374,374,This Robot Arm Learned To Assemble Objects It Hasn’t Seen Before,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows off a learning-based assembler robot that is able to put together simple contraptions. Since this is a neural-network based learning method, it needs to be trained to be able to do this. The training process takes place by assembling, disassembling, and doing it over and over again, several hundred times per object. When showing it new objects, it was able to successfully assemble them 86% of the time. This technique works on a 2D planar surface, for instance, this table, and while it is. able to insert most of these parts vertically it does not deal well with more complex. assemblies that require inserting screws and pegs in a 45 degree angle.

In many cases, the algorithm outperforms us several times, and up to several hundred times. This new method is so general, that it does as well as AlphaZero at these games, however, it can also play a wide variety of Atari games as well. The new technique beats the others on about 66% of the games, including the Recurrent Experience Replay technique, in short, R2D2.

378,378,Is a Realistic Water Bubble Simulation Possible?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you how to add foam, spray and bubble particles to a fluid simulation. The technique is so simple that it can be implemented in Blender plugin called FLIP Fluids. The fluid simulation took about 8 hours, and as always, I went a little overboard with the light transport, that took about 40 hours. It is one of the miracles of the world that we can take a piece of silicon in our machines, and through the power of science, explain fluid dynamics to it so well that such a simulation can come out of it. Have a look at the video below to see how the technique was implemented in a modern framework, and boy, does it come to life in there. You can also see how I challenged it about how good I think about fluid research in general. You see, I have a great deal of admiration for a 20-page long technique that gets us 80% of the way to an almost trivially simple method. Finally, these wave crests can be found through a high- locally convex method, which is also super simple and can be implement in a day and a half. It really changed my thinking about fluid simulation, but this paper is so good, I see it as so good for general research.","How to Add Foam, Spray and Bubble Particles to a Fluid Simulation"
379,379,This Neural Network Combines Motion Capture and Physics,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Is it possible to create something that reacts to our commands with the controller, looks good, and also adheres to physics? Well, have a look! This work was developed at Ubisoft La Forge. It responds to our input via the controller and the output animations are fluid and natural. Since it relies on a technique called deep reinforcement learning, it requires training. You see that early on, the blue agent is trying to imitate the white character, and it is not doing well at all. It basically looks like me when going to bed after reading papers all night. The white agent’s movement is not physically simulated and was built using a motion database with only 10 minutes of animation data. This is the one that is in the “looks good” category. Or, it would look really good if it wasn’t pacing around like a drunkard, so the question naturally arises, who in their right minds would control a character like this? Well of course, no one! This sequence was generated by an artificial, worst-case player which is a nightmare situation for any AI to reproduce. However…after 30 hours of training, theBlue agent learned to reproduce the motion of theWhite character, while being physically simulated.",How to Create a Game That Reacts to the Controller and Looks Good
380,380,"Finally, Differentiable Physics is Here!","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new research work that performs something that they call differentiable rendering. The problem formulation is the following: we specify a target image that is either rendered by a computer program, or even better, a photo. Now, because it progressively changes the input materials, textures, and even the geometry of this input in a 3D modeler system, it is able to match this photo. The system is general, and therefore can be applied to many-many more problems. For instance, it can also teach this gooey object to actuate itself in a way so that it would start to walk properly within only 2 minutes. The full thesis and the source code is available in the video description, and one of my kind students has even implemented it in Blender. We’ll have a look at a few that are much more challenging than this example. What a time to be alive! This episode has been supported by Biights & Biights.

384,384,Neural Portrait Relighting is Here!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Can neural networks put a dent into this problem and give us something new and better? The examples that you see here are done with this new work that uses a learning-based technique, and is able to change the lighting for human portraits. The paper contains a new dataset with over 25 thousand portrait images that are relit in 5 different ways. It also proposes a neural network structure that can learn this relighting operation efficiently. The encoder part takes an image as an input and estimates what lighting could have been used to produce it. The decoder part is where we can play around with changing the lighting, and it will generate the appropriate image that this kind of lighting would produce. The image on the left shows the result using all skip connections, while as we traverse to the right, we see the results omitting them. These connections indeed make a profound difference. I cannot wait to see some followup papers that take more advanced effects like this into consideration for relighting as well.

386,386,The Story of Light!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér talks about how to make light transport simulations more realistic. He explains how to combine different techniques to create a smoother, less noisy image. He also talks about his time at Disney working with Wojciech Jarosz, who is now a professor at the Darthmouth University, and how he came to be involved in the UPBP project. He ends the episode with a look at some of the techniques he used to create UPBP, which stands for unifying points and beams, and it formulates multiple importance sampling between all of these different kinds of light transport paths. It is absolutely unreal and you can see as they are running that they are completely unifying and you are running a completely different simulation program, and you see the difference in the results of these two programs. It's like witchcraft, I tell you. I can say without exaggeration that this is one of the most powerful techniques in all photorealistic rendering research. And now, hold on to your papers, because we have finally arrived to the main paper of this episode of Two Minute Papers, which we will talk about in the second half of the show. It will be about how we can make light travel between points in space, and between two beams instead.",Two Minute Papers - The Main Paper

388,388,Can We Detect Neural Image Generators?,"Every image that you see here and throughout this video is generated by one of these learning-based methods. These can offer high-fidelity synthesis, and not only that, but we can often even exert artistic control over the outputs. Now that we can generate arbitrarily many beautiful images with these learning algorithms, they will inevitably appear in many corners of the internet. So an important new question arises can we detect if an image was made by these methods? This new paper argues that the answer is a resounding yes. So, this detector was only trained on real images and synthetic ones created by the ProGAN technique, and you see with the blue bars that the detection ratio is quite close to perfect for a number of techniques, save for these two. If you look at the paper in the description, you will get a lot more insights as to how robust it is against compression artifacts, a little frequency analysis of the different synthesis techniques, and more. Let’s send a huge thank you to the authors of the paper, who also provide the source code and training data for this technique. And of course, DeepFake creation provides fertile grounds for research works, so much so that at this point, it seems to be a subfield of its own where the rate of progress is just stunning.

394,394,Can Self-Driving Cars Learn Depth Perception?,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. This week, we look at unsupervised depth learning from videos. Unsupervised learning is proper machine learning, where no crutches are allowed. We just unleash the algorithm on a bunch of data, with no labels, and if we do it well, the neural network will learn something useful from it. We can also use this depth information to enhance the perception of self-driving cars, but this application is much, much harder, because in the earlier, supervised learning example, we have trained the network in a simulation, and then, we also use it later in a computer game, which is, of course, another simulation. Let me explain why I am so excited for this work. Wo-hoo! This is something this is something to be excited about. This is the input and this output is the perfect depth map that is concealed from our beloved algorithm and is there is only one way to succeed. And there is this simple, but powerful thought that leads to far-reaching conclusions. These are two previous works, both of which were trained via supervised learning, showing it is possible to use this method. The first was showing it by showing it was able to both use its performance and evaluate its performance. The second is showing it can be used to create real-time defocus effects.",Unsupervised Deep Learning From Videos

400,400,"Sure, DeepFake Detectors Exist - But Can They Be Fooled?","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: With the ascendancy of neural network-based learning algorithms, we are now able to take on, and defeat problems that sounded completely impossible just a few years ago. A paper by the name FaceForensics contains a large dataset of original and manipulated video pairs. As this offered a ton of training data for real and forged videos, it became possible to use these to train a deepfake detector. The success rate on uncompressed videos is over 98% which is amazing, but, note that when using video compression, this success rate may drop to 58 to 92% depending on the detector. This is a cool work that gives us a more nuanced view about the current state of the art around deepfakes and deepfake detectors.

407,407,This AI Does Nothing In Games…And Still Wins!,"Researchers are trying to break machine learning systems by changing the information they are presented with. For instance, adding a tiny bit of noise to a large portion of the video input can force the learning algorithm to choose a different action than it would have chosen otherwise. In pong, a tiny fake ball to the game can coerce the learner into going down when it was originally planning to go up. The algorithm itself is able to pick up game-specific knowledge by itself and find out how to fool the other AI using it. It is not always true that we can just change these images or the playing environment to our desire to fool these algorithms. Is it possible to just enter the game as a player, and perform interesting stunts that can reliably win against these AIs? And with this, we have arrived to the subject of today’s paper. The answer is that the adversary induces off-distribution. The actions of the AI against different opponents are normal, but when we play against this adversarial agent, which is named Zoo, the actions are not. This tells us how likely it is that things are happening as expected. Things are happening in the positive region, meaning that things go as expected in the normal case, but not in the Zoo case.",Machine Learning - The Anomaly of the Anomaly of the Anomaly

411,411,DeepMind Made A Superhuman AI For 57 Atari Games!,"DeepMind worked on an incredible learning algorithm by the name Deep Reinforcement Learning. This technique looked at the pixels of the game, was given a controller and played much like a human would. It did not do well on Montezuma’s revenge or Pitfall because these games require more long-term planning. A followup work was to infuse these agents with a very human-like property… curiosity. That agent was able to do much, much better at these games…and then got addicted to the TV. And believe it or not, as impossible as it may sound, all of this has been improved significantly. This new work is called Agent57, and it plays better than humans, on all 57 Atari games. And please do not forget the first time at DeepMind scientists found a learning algorithm that exceeds human performance on all Atari games, please do the test yourself. It truly looks like science fiction. The long term part is also called a meta-controller that can decide when to prioritize short and long term challenges in short term. On the short term, we typically have something like avoiding a skull or dodging shots of an enemy ship in Solaris. If this were a school project, the Solaris game would be a brutal, merciless teacher. Would you like to know your grade? No grades, but he tells you that you failed. He won’t say.

413,413,DeepMind’s New AI Helps Detecting Breast Cancer,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: In medical imaging, a common problem is that we have so many diagnostic images out there in the wild that it makes it more and more infeasible for doctors to look at all of them. The training part takes about 14,000 optical coherence tomography scans. After the learning process, this method can reproduce these segmentations really well by itself, without the doctor’s supervision, and you see here that the two images are almost identical in these tests. And now, hold on to your papers because here comes the best part. If we compare the predictions of the AI to the human experts, we see that the false positive cases have been reduced by 5.7%. That is the holy grail! We don’t need to consider the cost of false positives or false negatives here, because it is the reason why you see so many authors on this project on this paper. Another interesting tidbit is that the AI was trained on subjects who have no vested interest in this project. It means that the results did not come from the scientists who wrote the paper, but from an independent group of scientists who came out of the project and checked the algorithm and the results. And with this, we have arrived to the central thesis of the paper.",The Best Part of the Paper
414,414,Is Style Transfer For Fluid Simulations Possible?,"Style transfer is a technique in machine learning research where we have two input images, one for content, and one for style, and the output is our content image reimagined with this new style. An earlier paper had shown that the more sophisticated ones can sometimes make even art curators think that they are real. This new work takes an even more brazen vantage point to this question. The title of the paper says Lagrangian style neural style transfer. So what does that mean? It means particles! This was made for particle-based simulations, which comes with several advantages. One, because the styles are now attached to particles, we can choose different styles for different smoke plumes, and they will remember what style they are supposed to follow. Two, it not only provides us these high-quality results, but, it is fast. And by this, I mean blazing fast. Artists are going to do miracles with this technique, I am sure. The next step is going to be a real-time algorithm, which may appear as soon as one or two more works, and you can bet that I’ll be here to cover it. Also, make sure to look at the full paper in the video, because it is beautiful and a lot of fun to read.",Lagrangian Style Neural Style Transfer
415,415,This AI Controls Virtual Quadrupeds!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Motion capture is often the go-to tool for the job. But, unfortunately, there is a problem. If we write an agent that behaves according to physics, it will be difficult to control properly. This is where this new technique shines. It gives us physically appealing motion, and we can grab a controller and play with the character like in a video game. We can also add sensors to the agent to allow them to navigate in a realistic manner. And if you have been watching this series for a while, you know what is coming…of course, throwing blocks at the AI is like taking it like a champ. Just a note on how remarkable this remarkable technique is. It is already being used by computer graphics researchers, being used to make computer graphics more realistic. And of course, being computer graphics, researchers, throw some blocks into the mix for good measure. This was the amazing technique that DeepMind used to defeat Atari Breakout. So, hold on to your papers because it enables synthesizing motion that is very robust against tough, previously unseen tough scenarios. This already sounds like science fiction. This paper proposes that in step number two, we try an architecture by the name generative adversarial network.",Motion Capture - A New Technique
416,416,OpenAI’s Jukebox AI Writes Amazing New Songs,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: There is no shortage of neural network-based methods that can perform physics simulations, style transfer, deepfakes, and a lot more. In OpenAI’s new work, they tried to fuse the two concepts together, or, in other words, take a genre, an artist, and even lyrics as an input, and it would create a song for us. It currently takes 9 hours to generate one minute of music, and is mainly trained on Western music and English, but you know, as we always say, we will always say more here, down the line. Note that it has its own video of its own, and there is so much more cool stuff in here that it would be worthy of a own video. Loved the AI-based lyrics too. Glorious! If you look in the video description, you will find a selection of uncurated music samples as well. Listen as their AI starts out from the first 6 notes of a Chopin piece and transitions into a pop style with a bunch of different instruments entering a few seconds in. Very cool! The score-based techniques are a little lacking in nuance, but can do magical genre mixing and more, whereas the waveform-based Techniques can create much more sophisticated music.",OpenAI - A New Way to Create Music
417,417,How Well Can DeepMind's AI Learn Physics?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We can create wondrous fluid simulations like the ones you see here by studying the laws of fluid motion from physics. The amount of detail we can simulate with these programs is nothing short of amazing. However, I just mentioned neural networks. If we can write a simulator that runs the laws. of physics to create these programs, why would we need learning-based. algorithms? The answer is in this paper that we have discussed about 300 episodes ago. The goal was to show a neural network video footage of lots and lots of fluid and smoke simulations, and have it learn how the dynamics work. We stop the video and it would learn how to continue it, if you will. But there is more! We can train it by showing how water behaves on these water ramps, and then, let’s remove the ramps and see if it understands what it has to do with all these particles? Yes, it does! Now, I want more ramps! And with sand too. And now, I love it even more. And we are even being paid to do this! The reason why you see so many particles in many of these views is because if we look under the hood, we see that this is a really cool graph-based method that represents the particles.",How to Create a Neural Network Simulation

This is going to be a one-off video that is longer and a tiny bit more technical. Let me know in the comments when you have finished the video. And worry not, all the upcoming videos will be in the usual Two Minute Papers format. And now, let’s dive into the paper. In a previous paper, our goal was to populate a scene with over a hundred materials with a learning-based technique, and create a beautiful planet with rich vegetation. One of the key elements to accomplish this was to use a neural renderer, or in other words, a decoder network that you see here which took a material shader description as an input and predicted its appearance, thereby replacing the renderer we used in the project. It had its own limitations, for instance, it was limited to this scene with a fixed lighting setup, and only the material properties were subject to change. But in return, it mimiced the global illumination renderer rapidly and faithfully. And, in this new work, ourgoal was to take a different vantage point, and help artists with general image processing knowledge to perform material synthesis. The whole process executes in 20 seconds.",The New Paper

423,423,This is Geometry Processing Made Easy!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Monte Carlo Geometry Processing may be the best computer graphics paper of the year. The technique can be used to create beautiful light simulations. It has lots of amazing uses in light transport simulations, so if you would like to hear more about this work, make sure to check out the video description in the description. But first, let’s discuss six amazing applications, while noting that there are so many more in the paper, which you can and should check out in theVideo description. One needs a PhD and years of experience in computer graphics to implement this work. We had a mega-episode on multiple importance sampling, so please hear more on that in the Video description. And here is a video of a 3D model of a shovelnose frog that was created using this technique. It can resolve the rich external and internal structure of this ant. For instance, it can also compute a CT scan of the infamous shoveln nose frog that you see here, and instead of creating the full 3D solution, we only have to compute a 2D slice of it, which is much, much cheaper. Five, performing a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition with this method is also possible. This is a technique that is used widely in many domains.",Monte Carlo Geometry Processing - The Best Computer Graphics Paper of the Year
424,424,Can an AI Learn Lip Reading?,"A new technique is able to produce the entirety of this speech after looking at the video footage of the lip movements. Potential applications of this could be video conferencing in zones where we have to be silent, giving a voice to people with the inability to speak due to aphonia or other conditions. With an additional speaker embedding step, it is possible to pair up any speaker with any voice. This is another amazing work that makes me feel like we are living in a science fiction world. I can only imagine what we will be able to do with this technique two more papers down the line. If you have any ideas, feel free to speculate in the comments section below. What a time to be alive!

425,425,This AI Creates Beautiful 3D Photographs!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We need not only color, but depth information in our images. With proper depth information, we can now create these 3D photographs. We can look behind objects and see things that we wouldn’t see otherwise. Beautiful parallax effects appear as objects at different distances move different amounts as we move the camera around. These photos truly come alive with this new method. And this also performs as a tool to compare images, and this also concludes that the new method is still not perfect, but witnessing this huge leap in the quality of images in such little time is truly a sight to behold! What a time to be alive! I hope that I make people feel how I feel when I read these papers, and I really hope that it goes through with this series of two-minute papers.

426,426,This AI Creates Dogs From Cats…And More!,"StarGAN 2 can generate images of photorealistic human faces for people that don’t exist. It can also translate different features, for instance, ears, eyes, noses from a cat to a dog or a cheetah in a way that makes sense. The algorithm picks up the gaze direction, so this generalizes to even animals. The key difference in this new work compared to previous techniques, is that it creates not one latent space, but several of these latent spaces for different domains. It is a simpler, often incomplete, but, more manageable representation for a given domain. This domain can be almost anything, for example, you see another technique that does something similar with material models. What do you think? What do some of you can weigh in on this?

427,427,An AI Learned To See Through Obstructions!,"A learning-based algorithm is able to find and remove obstructions from an image sequence. It can also perform reflection removal, and some of the input images are highly contaminated by these reflected objects. It even works for video outputs as well, so if you did not have a clear sight of that tiger in the zoo, do not despair! Just use this method, and there you go. It also does quite well when compared to previous methods, especially when we are able to provide multiple images as an input. If these AR glasses that we hear so much about come to fruition in the next few years, having an algorithm for real-time glare, reflection and obstruction removal would be amazing.

428,428,These AI-Driven Characters Dribble Like Mad!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We need to teach computers how the different joints and body parts of these virtual characters are meant to move around over time. He says the key challenge is that all we are given, is 3 hours of unstructured motion capture data. From this next to nothing, a learning algorithm has to learn to understand these motions so well, that it can weave them together, even when a specific movement combination is not present in this data, he says. ""Just imagine what this research area will be capable of not in a decade, but just two more papers down the line,"" he says, ""I am absolutely spellbound by this work, and I hope that now you are too"" ""I'll see you next time for your generous support,"" he adds, ""and I hope you'll see me next time!"" ""Can’t wait to see this implemented in newer games and other real-time applications,"" says Károley. ""I’m loving it. I’ve found even more surprising is that it could handle unexpected movements, which I find to be even more remarkable given the limited training data,"" says the researcher. ""And remember, this new method is also much more responsive to the player’s controls, and thus, more enjoyable not only to look at, but to play with""",Learning Algorithms to Understand Virtual Characters
429,429,OpenAI GPT-3 - Good At Almost Everything!,"In early 2019, a learning-based technique appeared that could perform common natural language processing operations, for instance, answering questions, completing text, reading comprehension, summarization, and more. This method was developed by scientists at OpenAI, and they called it GPT-2. The goal was to be able to perform this task with as little supervision as possible. This means that they unleashed this algorithm to read the internet, and the question is, what would the AI learn during this process? That is a tricky question. And to answer it, have a look at this paper from 2017, where an AI was given a bunch of Amazon product reviews. The finished neural network used surprisingly few neurons, and upon closer inspection, they noticed that the neural network has built up a knowledge of not only language, but also built a sentiment detector as well. As we grow the network, something incredible happens. Non-trivial capabilities start to appear as we approach a hundred billion parameters. Look! It nearly matched the level of humans. My goodness! This was possible before, but only with neural networks that are specifically designed for a narrow task. In comparison, GPT 3 is much more general. Let’s test that generality and have aLook at 5 practical applications together!",GPT 2: A Neural Network That Can Read the Internet
430,430,Can We Simulate Tearing Meat?,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is a weekly video series. This week, we look at a new way to simulate cracking and tearing phenomena. With this method, we could smash oreos, candy crabs, pumpkins, and much, much more. It even supported tearing this piece of bread apart.

431,431,From Video Games To Reality…With Just One AI!,"Researchers at NVIDIA proposed a new technique, that requests some additional information, for instance, a depth map that provides a little more information on how far different parts of the image are from the camera. This new technique also reuses information from previous frames efficiently, and therefore, it is finally able to create a consistent video, with much less morphing and warping, and even better, we have this advantageous consistency property. And for now, we can create consistent photorealistic videos even if all we have is freely obtained video game data. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!

432,432,How Can We Simulate Water Droplets?,"A computer graphics paper from approximately 3 years ago was able to simulate the motion of these bubbles, and even these beautiful collision events between them in a matter of milliseconds. Now, three years later, let’s see how this field evolved. The new technique that will now, simulate the evolution of two cube-shaped droplets for us. Simulating this fluid chain example took roughly 60 seconds per frame. This droplet on a plane example runs approximately ten times faster than that, it needs only 6.5 seconds for each frame. Since part of this algorithm runs on your processor, and a different part on your graphics card, there is plenty of room for improvements in terms of the computation time for a followup paper. I cannot wait to see these beautiful simulations in real time two more papers down the line. What a time to be alive!

He says the authors took a clean photo of the subject, that’s the one without the shadows, and then, and add shadows to it algorithmically. The results are not bad at all, and get this, they even accounted for subsurface scattering, which is the scattering of light under our skin, he says. The algorithm may still fail to remove some highly detailed shadows, but it is still convincingly beats previous works, he adds.

435,435,This AI Creates Images Of Nearly Any Animal!,"The research field of image translation with the aid of learning algorithms has been on fire lately. This new method offers something really amazing: it can handle multiple domains, or multiple breeds, if you will, even ones that it hadn’t seen previously. For instance, in this output, we get two dogs, which seems to be a mix of the content and the style dog. Not all cases do this well with the intermediate images, however. How do we solve that? Of course, with nuclear fission. Look! Very amusing. Loving this example, especially how impossible it seems because the owl is looking into the camera with both eyes, while, we see its backside below the head. If it looked to the side, like the input content image, this might be a possibility. But with this contorted body posture, I am not so sure, so I’ll give it a pass on this one. So there you go, transforming one known animal into a different one that the AI has never seen before. And it is already doing a more than a formidable job at that! What a time to be alive!

436,436,OpenAI’s Image GPT Completes Your Images With Style!,"Scientists at OpenAI introduced a new version of this method that tries to complete not text, but…images! The problem statement is simple: we give it an incomplete image, and we ask the AI to fill in the missing pixels. That is, of course, an immensely difficult task, because these images may depict any part of the world around us. Here are some more results, and note that these are not cherrypicked, or in other words, there was no selection process for the results. These came out from the AI as you see them, so make sure to have a link to the paper in the video description, and let me know in the comments if you have found something interesting! So what about the size of the neural network for this technique? Well, it contains from 1.5 to about 7 billion parameters. Let’s have a look together and find out what that means. These are the results from the GPT-2 paper, the previous version of the text processor on a challenging reading function. Non-rivial capabilities started to appear as we started to approach the level of human comprehension, something incredible happened as we approached the end of the paper.

It uses a crude sketch as a guide image, and out comes a nearly photorealistic human face that matches it. The objective is always to get out of the way, and help the artist spend more time bringing their artistic vision to life, and spend less time on the execution. This work is not without failure cases, but the AI is not explicitly instructed to match the eye colors, where some asymmetry may arise in the output.

439,439,Can We Simulate a Rocket Launch?,"In real production environments, these simulations often involve complex scenes with many objects that interact with each other. Computing these interactions is called coupling, and it is very difficult to get right, but is necessary for many of the scenes you will see throughout this video. This new graphics paper builds on a technique called the Lattice Boltzmann Method and promises a better way to compute this two-way coupling. And now comes my favorite part, and this is when we let reality be our judge and compare the simulation results with real-world experiments. Hold on to your papers while you observe the real experiment here on the left. And then, the algorithmic reproduction of the same scene here. How close are they? Goodness…very, very close. Love it. The technique can also undergo the wind tunnel test, and here is the real footage. And it is truly remarkable how close this is able to match it, and I was wondering that even though as someone who has been doing fluids for a while now, if someone cropped this part of the image and told me that it is real- world footage, I would have believed it in a second. Just look at all this magnificent progress in just 2 years. The quickest example was this, as it was simulated in less than 6 seconds, which I find to be mind blowing.

As a result, none of the faces that you see here are real, all of them were generated by this technique. We could also exert artistic control over these outputs by combining aspects of multiple faces together. The key here is that if we change one image, then we have a new and original image.

It also understood depth so accurately that we could use it for augmented reality applications where we put a new, virtual object in the scene and it correctly determined whether it is in front of, or behind the real objects.

444,444,AI-Based Style Transfer For Video…Now in Real Time!,"Style transfer is an interesting problem in machine learning research where we have two input images, one for content, and one for style, and the output is our content image reimagined with this new style. The cool part is that the content can be a photo straight from our camera, or the style can be an artistic painting. The main advantage of this new method, compared to previous ones is that they either take too long, or we have to run an expensive pre-training step. With this new one, we can just start drawing and see the output results right away. But it gets even better. All we need to do is change our input drawing and it transfers the new style to the video as fast as we can draw! This way we can refine our input style for as long as we wish, or until we find the perfect way to stylize the video. And there is even more. This technique also comes with some limitations. For instance, there is still some temporal flickering in the outputs, and in some cases, separating the foreground and the background is challenging. But really, such incredible progress in just one year! And I can only imagine what this method will be capable of two more papers down the line.

We start out with a really noisy image, and as we add more rays, the image gets clearer and clearer over time. The time it takes for these images to clean up depends on the complexity of the geometry and our material models, but it typically takes a while. This is indeed a notoriously difficult scene to render, even for Metropolis Light Transport, the better technique. It can do so much better in the same amount of time in the new technique.

447,447,Enhance! Neural Supersampling is Here!,"Super resolution is not the most reliable way of delivering high-quality images in many real-time applications, for instance, video games. A recent paper uses a neural network to perform supersampling at a more reasonable computational cost. This neural supersampler is significantly better at antialiasing, or in other words, smoothing these jagged edges, and not only that, but it also resolves many more of the intricate details of the image. The paper also contains a ton more comparisons against recent methods, so make sure to have a look! Like many of us, I would love to see a comparison against NVIDIA’s DLSS solution, but I haven’t been able to find a paper on the later versions of this method.

449,449,This Is What Simulating a 100 Million Particles Looks Like!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created a new particle data structure that is better suited for number crunching on the graphics card. As a result, this runs the Material Point Method, the algorithm that is capable of simulating these wondrous things you are seeing here. This means that we get crushing concrete, falling soil, candy bowls, sand armadillos, oh my! You name it. And all this, much faster than before. This was nearly impossible when I started my PhD and today, less than a minute for one frame. It truly feels like we are living in a science fiction world. What a time to be alive! I couldn’t resist it. I couldn't resist it! I’m so happy to have you with me today, my friends. I love you all so much, and I hope to see you again in a year or two.” – Dr. Zsoltai-fehér, Professor of Computer Science, University of Cambridge. “I’ll take this any day of the week,” he said, “because it’s a great deal of fun!” “This is a very exciting time for me,’ he added, ‘because I love physics.’ “",The New Particle Data Structure

451,451,"Beautiful Elastic Simulations, Now Much Faster!","Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows how a new algorithm can be used to simulate complex scenes. The algorithm is more general and can simulate this kind of interaction between liquids and granular media as an additional side effect. This leads to not only these amazingly general and realistic simulations, but they also run faster. The key to achieving these amazing results in a reasonable amount of time is that this new method is able to find these interfaces where the fluids and solids meet and handles their interactions in a way that we can advance the time in our simulation in larger steps than previous methods. Thanks  for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! Back to Mail Online home. Back to the page you came from. The Two Minute Papers series is back with a new video each week. The next video is the second in the series, this time on the subject of fluid simulations. The first video is a simulation of an elastic bear taking a bath in a pool of water. The third and final video is of a frog being lifted into the air by a ball of water, and then dropping it into the pool of sand.

452,452,"Finally, Deformation Simulation... in Real Time!","Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is a weekly, off-beat look at the latest in computer graphics. This week, we look at a new technique that can simulate fluid simulations. We also look at how well it can simulate rolling marbles on a table. At the end of the video, I will tell you how much time it takes to simulate all of the things we see in the video. Let me know in the comments if you are one of our OG Fellow Scholars who were there when this episode was published hundreds of videos ago. We don't need an all-nighter or a coffee break, we don’t need to even need to wait to even wait for the video to start! Now, let’s start the video at all! Now at the start of thevideo, I noted that the claim in the abstract is almost outrageous. It is because it is able to be able to do more than the previous techniques, and to simplify the algorithm itself. We can generate more than 3000 frames per second with it, not only do we not need an All Nighters or a Coffee Break, but we can even do it with a third of a millisecond, which means only 18 frames per frame.",Two Minute Papers With Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér

454,454,This AI Creates A 3D Model of You!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Can we reconstruct the entire 3D geometry of the model itself? That sounds like science fiction, right? Or with today’s powerful learning algorithms, maybe it is finally a possibility, who really knows? Let's have a look together and evaluate it with three, increasingly more difficult experiments. And now, hold on to your papers for experiment number two, because it can not only deal with still images of the front side only, but it can also reconstruct the backside of the person. Don’t expect miracles, at least not yet, there is obviously still quite a bit of flickering left, but the preliminary results are quite encouraging, and I am fairly certain that two more papers down the line, and these video results will be nearly as good as the ones were for the still images.

457,457,Is Videoconferencing With Smart Glasses Possible?,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has developed an algorithm that can reconstruct the frontal view of a human face. The algorithm can deal with the tiniest eye movements, twitches, tongue movements and more. It can also create arbitrary head movement, because it can simply guess what the real head movement is because we have a background of the real view of the head. The new method does much better across the entirety of  the face. It still has some trouble with the   cable and the glasses, but otherwise,  this is a clean, clean image. And the results are outstanding, especially if we compare it again  to the pix2pix technique from 2017. And it really shows in the results. About four minutes of video footage is fine and this needs to be done once again, once again knows these people and had seen them before. But in return, we get an excellent view of subtle facial expressions, and we have more control over this data. So with all that extra knowledge, what else can we do with AI?

459,459,These Are Pixels Made of Wood!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Computational parquetry is a new way of reproducing images by cutting wood slabs into tiny pieces and putting them together carefully. The key requirement is that if we look from afar,  it looks like the target image, but if we zoom in, it gets abundantly clear that the puzzle pieces here are indeed made of real wood. The authors opted to transform both  of them to grayscale, and match not the colors, but the intensities of the colors instead. The left part of the suit gets a lot of detail, while the right part, not so much. But the authors have two really cool heuristics to address this problem: First, we can start from the middle, that gives us a reasonably good solution, since the object of interest is often in the middle of the image. Or, even better, even if that does not work too well, can fill in the places where there is a lot on the image and try to fill it in for it, if there is still good pieces available for it. But look. There  is still a problem…the left part is better, less or more detail, but it needs to be a little more consistent.",Computational Parquetry - A New Way of Reproducing Images by Cutting Wood Into Pieces
460,460,What Is 3D Photography?,"A new learning-based method promises to create a 3D photo that we can rotate around. The algorithm creates a depth map by itself. This depth map tells the algorithm how far different parts of the image are from the camera. Then, with this depth information, it now has an understanding of what is where in this image, and creates these layers. After a little housekeeping, we find out that this is a battery killer, because the whole process is done in approximately one second. Holy mother of the wild! I am very excited to see this technique out there in the wild as possible! Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time! Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. The Two Minute Papers is a weekly, offbeat look at what's happening in the world of science and technology. This week, we look at a new method for creating 3D photos using an AI system.

When we capture a video, it will see…something  like this. Since it is doing the reconstruction in layers,  we know how far each object is in these scenes. This enables us to rotate these sparks and  flames and look at them in 3D. We can use our mouse to look around within the photo in our web browser. Or we can make the viewing experience even more immersive with a head-mounted display, where,   of course, the image will follow wherever  we turn our head.

465,465,OpenAI DALL-E: Fighter Jet For The Mind!,"In early 2019, a learning-based technique appeared that could perform common natural language processing operations. Scientists at OpenAI thought that if we can complete text sentences, why not try to complete images too? They called this project image GPT and the problem statement was simple: we give it an incomplete image, and we ask the AI to fill in the missing pixels. Now, in January 2021, just 7 months after the release of GPT-3, here is their new mind-blowing technique that explores the connection between text and images. The name of this technique is a mix of Salvador Dalí and Pixar’s Wall-e. So please meet Dall-e, and if you’re a light transport researcher by trade, I am happy to see that concept of low polygon count rendering, clay objects, and even an X-ray view to the Owl. And now, if all that wasn’t enough, hold on to your papers, because we also commission artistic illustrations for free, not only that, but even fine-grained control over these illustrations.

And get this, they are even able even climb things. He says the new method showcases a surface-only formulation, and a key observation here is that we don’t have to compute how the magnetic forces act on the entirety of the 3D fluid domain. And that’s not all, fortunately, this work is also ample in amazing visualizations, for instance, this one shows how the ferro fluid changes if we crank up the strength of our magnets.

468,468,This AI Learned To Create Dynamic Photos!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. A new technique can synthesize previously unseen views of a scene. It can also change the lighting, but only the lighting. And it can change the time, and the view direction...and the lighting separately. It does three things that previous techniques could do one by one, but really, how does its quality compare to these previous methods? Let’s see how it does on thin geometry, which is a difficult case for a previous one. A different technique by the name Local Light Field Fusion not only missed the halo-like artifacts to the scene, but also the top of the scene. And, as you see with this footage, there are cases where it might confuse the background with the foreground, and we kept that part hidden from the AI. Perhaps the best part is that it also has an online demo that you can try now, so make sure to click the link in the description to have a look at the video. And now, hold on to your papers, and…whoa…look at these 5 dots here. Do you know what this means? It means that all the AI saw was five images, that is five samples from the scene with different light positions, and it could fill in all the missing details with such accuracy. And all this from 5 input photos. Absolutely amazing.",New Technique Can Synthesize Unseen Views of a Scene
469,469,Episode 500 - 8 Years Of Progress In Cloth Simulations!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: In 2012, we were able to simulate the kinematics of yarn and cloth on our computers. Today, with this new technique, we can conjure up similar animations where pieces of garments tighten. The new technique can even simulate multiple cloth layers, look at the pocket and the stitching patterns here. We can also stack three tablecloths on top of each other and see how they would behave if we would not simulate friction. And now, the same footage with friction. Much more realistic. And if we look under the hood of the simulator, and…well, well, well. Do you see what I see here? Red dots. So, why did I get so excited about a couple red dots? Let’s find out together! These red dots solve a fundamental problem when simulating the movement of these yarns. The issue is that in the mathematical description of this problem, there is a stiffness term that does not behave well when two of these points slide too close to each other. This is incorrect behavior and it makes the simulation unstable. These are used as a stand-in until things stabilize. Look, the distances are large enough so that the mathematical framework can regain its validity and compute the stiffness term correctly, and look, the red dot disappears, and the simulation can continue.",The New Technique to Simulate the Kinematics of Yarn and Cloth

The method uses a neural network to create realistic motion that transitions from one stage to the next one. It can perform twists and turns, brisk walks and runs, and you will see in a minute, even dance moves. The new method outpaces the competition, so there is no wonder that this incredible paper was accepted to the ASGRAPH conference. It truly feels like we are living in a science fiction world. What a time to be alive! The value proposition of this technique is as simple as it gets: we set up a bunch of keyframes, these are the transparent figures. And the key of NPSS is that it measures how believable these motions are. And let’s see the new method…oh yes, yes it indeed…oh, yes, it does indeed…’oh, let's see thenew method… ’‘‘NPSS’ is subject to minimization, in other words, the lower the lower, the better.’ ‘“NPS’ means that it is likely that humans would also come to the same conclusion.” “’NPS is a number that we can produce in a short amount of time with a computer, and it is that that it correlates with human judgement’.",New Method for Animating Humanoids

If one day it comes to fruition, doctors could be trained to perform surgery in a virtual environment. We could train better pilots with better flight simulators, expose astronauts to virtual zero-gravity simulations. We can also organize imaginary boxes, and of course, we can’t leave out the the Two Minute Papers favorite, going into a physics simulation and playing with it with our own hands. This week, we look at a new algorithm that can deal with all of these rapid hand motions. And what’s more, it also works on this challenging hand massage scene. And now, let’S see how it does all this magic, because there is plenty of magic under the hood. And if you think “wow, that is horrific”, then you’ll need to hold on to your papers for the next one, which is…three…the geometric consistency term. And this is an excellent paper, so in the evaluation section, these terms are also tested in isolation, and the authors tell us exactly how much each of these ingredients contribute to the solution.

This kind of curriculum-driven learning can supercharge many different kinds of AIs. After learning 12 to 24 hours with this adaptive curriculum learning method, they become able to even run, deal with huge step height variations, high step tilt variations, and let’s see if they can pass the hardest exam… Look at this mess, my goodness, lots of variation in every parameter. And…Yes! It works! And the key point is that the system is general enough that it can teach different body types to do the same. If there is one thing that you take home from this video, it shouldn’t be that it takes from 12 to24 hours. It should be that theSystem is general. Normally, if we have a new body type, we need to write a new control algorithm, but in this case, whatever the body type is, we can use the same algorithm to teach it. Absolutely amazing.

With the ascendancy of neural-network based learning techniques, this previous method enables us to take and old old black and white movie that suffers from a lot of problems like missing data, flickering, and more. Now comes something even better, we have a new piece of work that performs not only restoration and colorization, but super-resolution as well! What this means is that we can take an antique photo, which suffers from an issues. Look, these old films exaggerate wrinkles a great deal, they even even darken the lips and do funny things with red colors. So with all these problems with the antique photos, our question is, what did Lincoln really look like? Well, let’s try an earlier framework for restoration, colorization and super resolution…and. Well, unfortunately, most of our issues still remain. Lots of exaggerated wrinkles, plasticky look, lots of detail is missing. Can we do better? well, hold on to your papers, and observe the output with the new technique. Outstanding. It truly feels like this photo has been rephotographed with a modern camera. And with that, please meet Time-Travel Rephotography.",Time-Travel Rephotography - A New Technique for Re-Rephotography
476,476,"Finally, Instant Monsters!","Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. A new technique that performs the impossible. All we need to do is grab a pencil and create a rough sketch of our character, then, it will take a big breath, and inflate it into a 3D model. This process was nearly 7 times faster than the classical workflow, but what   matters even more, this new workflow requires  zero expertise in 3D modeling and rigging. With this technique, absolutely  anybody can become an artist. The paper was accepted to the SIGGRAPH ASIA conference, which is equivalent to winning an olympic gold medal in computer   graphics research if you will. If you have a little polishing, this may be ready to go for artistic projects with a little bit of polishing. The code for this project is also available online, and there is also an online demo of this project. And with that said, when we can use this? Extra style points for that style of drawing that that we’s the best part right now!

He has created a computer simulation that can destroy virtual objects in a spectacular fashion. The new technique promises a technique that supports more extreme compression and deformation, and when they say that, they really mean it. All this new technique asks for is a few seconds per frame for the simpler scenes, and in the order of minutes perframe for the more crazy tests out there.

480,480,3 New Things An AI Can Do With Your Photos!,"StyleGAN2 is a neural network-based learning method by the name StyleFlow. StyleFlow can take an input photo of a test subject, and edit a number of meaningful parameters. Age, expression, lighting, pose, you name it. For instance, it could also grew Elon musk a majestic beard. But what about cars, what about paintings? Well, this new technique found a way to navigate these latent spaces and introduces 3 amazing new examples of interpretable controls. It can repaint paintings. We can change the roughness of the brush strokes, simplify the style or even rotate the model. This way, we can create or adjust a painting without having to touch a paintbrush to even rotate it. And of course, it can also do the usual suspects, growing a beard, or growing a hairstyle, or changing the shape of the eyes, or the mouth. Loving it more, for instance, and do very little collateral damage to the remainder of the image. And since the punishment for dropping your papers is not short…in fact, it is quite long…this happened. Ouch. I hereby promise to never drop my papers, ever again.

481,481,All Hail The Adaptive Staggered Grid!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows off a new technique for simulating fluid and smoke simulations. The technique is called the Adaptive   Staggered-Tilted grid, an AST grid in short. The tilted part means that cells can be rotated by 45 degrees like this. And interestingly,   they typically appear only where needed, I’ll  show you in a moment. But how much more expensive is this kind of AST grid simulation than a regular grid? +100 percent   computation time? +50 percent? How much is it worth to you? Please stop the video and leave a comment with your guess. Thanks for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! I am so far, very impressed with this technique. And now, hold on to your papers  for experiment number four.   Thin water sheets. You can see the final  simulation here, and if we look under the hood, just look at how much work this algorithm is doing. And what is even better,   it only does so where it is really needed it doesn’t do any extra work in these regions. It costs almost nothing, and adds none of those costs. And in that time, we get all of these beautiful fluid and Smoke simulations. What a time to be alive!",Simulations of Fluid and Smoke Simulations
482,482,NVIDIA’s AI Puts Video Calls On Steroids!,"Scientists at NVIDIA just came up with an absolutely insane idea for video conferencing. Their idea is not to do what everyone else is doing, which is, transmitting our video to the person on the other end. What they do in this work, is take only the first image from the video, and they throw away the entire video afterwards. But before that, it stores a tiny bit of information from it, and how our head is moving over time. That is an absolutely outrageous idea… and of course, we like those around here, so, does this work? Well, let’s have a look. There is some jumpiness in the neck movement in the output video here, and some warping issues here, but otherwise, very impressive results. And the cool thing about this was that we could pretend to rotate the head and the result is that the head appears rotated in the image. That was great. But what if we take the source image from someone, and take this data, the keypoint is that we can transfer all of our gestures to them in a significantly better way than the previous methods. Look at the output of the new technique, and here is the comparison against H.264, a powerful and commonly used video compression standard. Overall, the authors report that their new method is ten times more efficient.",Video Conferencing - A New Way to Transfer Video
483,483,An AI That Makes Dog Photos - But How?,"StyleGAN2 is a neural network-based learning algorithm that is capable of creating these eye-poppingly detailed images of human beings that don’t even exist. The new version of the method is called StyleGAN2-ADA. What does that mean exactly? This means that the new method endeavors to squeeze as much information out of these training datasets as it can. The key is that with this, the neural network sees that they are artificially increasing the number of training samples. And now comes the best part, hold on to your hand and let’s take a look at the timeline of papers that came out in December 2019, and let us know who you think is the best of the bunch.

484,484,DeepMind’s AI Watches YouTube and Learns To Play!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: DeepMind developed an algorithm that learned to play Atari games on a superhuman level. He says the algorithm is an amazing breakthrough in AI research. The algorithm has an understanding of the game,  does not just copy the human demonstrator and even tries to change the response in response to us pressing the buttons on the controller. This means that it doesn’t know what it’s doing, which is huge, he says, and it is not hooked into the state of the games it is given to play. He concludes: “I think  you will love to see how far we have some since. And with that, let’�s discuss  theState of play in AIs playing difficult   exploration-based computer games.’ “I would like to invite you for a marvelous journey to see what happened,” he says. “You see, it was so observant and took away so much  from the human demonstrations that in the end,   it became even more efficient than its  human teacher. Whoa! Absolutely amazing!”“And while we are here, I would like  to dissect this copy-paste argument.”",DeepMind - A New AI Approach

486,486,This AI Learned To Stop Time!,"In March of 2020, a paper appeared describing an incredible technique by the name, Neural Radiance Fields, or NERF in short. A followup paper appeared 5 months later, in August of 2020. And today’s paper appeared just three months later in November 2020. It offers a new take on this problem and offers quote “Space-Time View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes” The space-time view synthesis means that we can record a video of someone doing something. Since we are recording movement in time, and there is also movement in space, or in other words, the camera is moving. Both time and space are moving. And what this can do is one, freeze one of these variables, or pretend as if the camera didn’t move. Or, two, pretend asif time didn't move, or, three, generate new views of the scene while movement takes place. It is still not perfect, but we have lost some detail, but witnessing this kind of progress in just a few months is truly a sight to behold. It really outperforms all these techniques from the same year. What a sight! It is much better! Look at that! And you see, this works on some regions, but the lack of information in some regions is quite apparent. As soon as we get into a more dynamic example, we get more usable.",Neural Radiance Fields - A New Approach to Neural Radiance Fields
487,487,Soap Bubble Simulations Are Now Possible!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér will show you the progress in computer graphics research through the lens of bubbles in computer simulations. He will show how a new technique can add bubbles to a plain water simulation, but also simulate how they would sound. The key to this work is that it is modeling how the thickness of the surfaces changes  over time. This variation in thicknesses is responsible for a selection of premium-quality effects in a simulation beyond surface vortices, interference patterns, and deformation-dependent rupturing of soap films. But how well does it compare to the strictest adversary of all… reality! I hope you know what is coming. Hold on to your papers, because now   we will let reality be our judge and compare the simulated results to that. And if you ask me, I would pay at the very least double for this, at the least, double the cost of this paper, because it is more complex, with the deforming part, which is only 4 to 7% of the computation. So, how much do we have to pay to pay for this? If you have been holding on for this so far, so far I would say that this is the best part of the paper because it comes the best in the cheaper cases, because that is the part that comes the most easily.",Computer Graphics Research Through the Lens of Bubbles in Computer Simulations
488,488,"Finally, Video Stabilization That Works!","Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new method for video stabilization. The new method can estimate the motion of objects better, and removes blurred images from the videos. It also collects data from neighboring video frames more effectively, which leads to a greater understanding of the video it is looking at. The results were stunning despite at many different competing techniques, and were found to be better at the very least 60% of the time, on all three questions. In some cases, even 90% or higher. Praise the papers! Now, there is only one question: How much longer does it take to run this new method? With one exception, these new methods take from half a second to about 7.5 seconds per frame, and this new one asks one for 95 seconds. And it creates absolutely amazing results in these cases, with the exception of these one in these amazing results. It scored best or second best on 6 out of 8 tests. This is truly remarkable, especially given that some of these competitors are from less than a year ago. That is nimble  progress in machine learning research. Loving it.

489,489,Do Neural Networks Think Like Our Brain? OpenAI Answers!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we are going to cover many important questions in life. The first question today is, do neural networks also have multimodal neurons? Not necessarily. The second question is, what is the essence of someone being shocked? Well, that is a coffee person before coffee alright. And the third question is: What is Jesus Christ's essence, and it includes the crown of thorns? And the fourth question is what is Lady Gaga’s essence? We will see some images of feelings, some of you might find some of them disturbing, but I think the vast majority of you humans will be just fine looking at them. We will also try some nasty attacks involving combining the two images, it can classify them with ease, but not too crazy, now, let’t go too crazy here. We’re going to look at how this works at how a previous neural network with an image of a bus can successfully tell us that yes, this is indeed a bus. And we’ll also look at some nasty adversarial attack techniques developed to fool a neural network by adding some sophisticated noise to a nearly imperceptible image. I will present this kind of noise as an ostrich, but the kind that I will not present as any kind of stress.",The Essence of a Person
490,490,Can You Put All This In a Photo?,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Virtual Reality, VR in short, is maturing at a rapid pace and its promise is truly incredible. To be able to do anything in a virtual world, we have to put on a head-mounted display that can tell the orientation of our head, and often, hands at all times. We can manipulate objects, or even wash our hands in virtual reality. What if we wish to look at a historic landmark from afar? Well, in this case, someone needs to capture a 360-degree photo of it. This new paper is called Omniphotos, and it helps us produce this 360 view synthesis, and when we put on that head- mounted display, we can really get a good feel of a remote place, a group photo, or an important family festivity. We need to be flailing. Yes. You see, we need to attach a consumer 360-camera to a selfie stick, and start flailing for about 10 seconds. And hold on to your papers, because the entirety of this work is handcrafted, no machine learning is in sight, and the result is quite general technique, or in other words, it works on a wide variety of real-world scenes, you see a good selection of those here.",Virtual Reality - A New Paper
491,491,This AI Makes Beautiful Videos From Your Images!,"In June 2020, OpenAI published an incredible AI-based technique by the name Image-GPT. If a machine can understand that this is a splash, could it, maybe, not only finish the  photo, but make a video out of it? Yes,   that is indeed an absolutely insane idea, we like those around here. And now, hold on to your papers, because  this technique does exactly that. And it not only works amazingly well, but look at the output video. It even loops perfectly. And what I like most is that it works mostly on fluids and smoke. That is an excellent combination for us, especially given that you see plenty of those simulations on this channel. So if you are a long-time Fellow Scholar,  you already have a keen eye for them. Now, if you have been holding on toyour papers so far, now, squeeze that paper, because   here comes the best one, three, my beard works too. Yes, you heard it right. This is not any kind of beard, this is an algorithmic beard that was made by an AI, and now it is animated as if it were a piece of fluid using different AI. Of course, this sounds like something straight out of a science fiction movie, but I also like how this has a nice quality to it.

By the end of this video, you will know exactly what that means and why that matters. In 2012, researchers were able to create highly detailed cloth geometries for digital characters. Now, nearly 9 years later, we can still simulate knitted and woven materials through similar programs that we call direct yarn-level simulations. The catch is that this is not free, there is a price we have to pay for these results. And now I hope you are wondering what the best curl of the day is? Yes, here is the one that was showcased in our intro, which is Two Minute Papers curling up. Huge congratulations to Georg Sperl, the first author of this paper, who simulated this scene with a super high stitching density. That is quite an honor for us, and a big thank you to Georg for his work on this paper. It was published in 2012, and now, almost 9 years have passed, so I wonder how far have we come some since? Well, we are talking several hours, or for this one, almost even an entire day to simulate just one piece of garment. Look.

493,493,Is Simulating Wet Papers Possible?,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér will show you some amazing works in the domain of computer graphics and physics simulations. We can simulate honey coiling, baking and melting, bouncy jelly and many related phenomena. None of these techniques use any machine learning, these are all good old-fashined handcrafted algorithms. Using these, we can even simulate stretching and compression, to the point that muscle movement simulations are possible. What’s more, this work can even perform muscle growth simulations. Do not forget that the First Law Of Papers says that research is a process that is really, really, fast, and that is truly something to behold to the authors on this paper. And now, let's look at where we will be two more papers down the line, where we are looking at where the generality of this system is going to be even more amazing to be on the other side of the line. We will see them all right now through 5 super fun experiments, starting with the ball of water and ending with the dog shaking off the water. The main reason for it required near a minute per experiment is that the algorithm computes these interactions between water and water in very small increments.

This is not the first technique to do this, but this…this does them better. We take an image, embed it into a latent space, and in this space, we can easily apply modifications. It can also perform the usual suspects. For instance, it can make us older or younger, or put a smile on our face too. However, three it works not only on human faces, but cars, animals, and buildings too. And what is even cooler is that we can not only produce these still images, but even compute intermediate images between two input photos, and get meaningful results.

503,503,Can We Teach Physics To A DeepMind's AI?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We can create wondrous fluid simulations by studying the laws of   fluid motion from physics. However, if we use a neural network to perform this task,   we have to train it, which is a long and  arduous process. This earlier work from last year  absolutely nailed this problem. And now, a newer iteration of a similar system  just came out from DeepMind’s research lab. It promises to extend these neural networks for an incredible set of use cases: aerodynamics, structural mechanics, cloth simulations and more. And, apparently, the same can be said for simulations and incompressible fluid dynamics, and can inspect the same in structural mechanics and cloth. And let’'s see if it can pull off this generalization of the underlying physics to be able to pull off many more generalization experiments with shapes that the algorithm has never seen before! And now comes the second half of my Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károley ZsOlnai-fehér. The second half comes 10 minutes later, when we look at the results of an experiment on a piece of cloth. The third and final half of the two-minute paper comes from the University of California, San Diego.",DeepMind DeepMind: A Newer Iteration of DeepMind DeepMind
504,504,Intel's Video Game Looks Like Reality!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is a professor of computer science at the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of a paper called Enhancing photorealism enhancement. In the paper, he shows how an AI can create photorealistic images from video footage from a video game. The algorithm can recreate video footage better than what would be possible with Unreal Engine 4 or Unreal Engine 5. He also shows how the algorithm can make convincing images for California, and yet, it can recreate it from video game footage from California, as well as Germany and Austria. The paper is published in the open-access journal, The Journal of Computer Science and the Arts, and can be read online at: http://www.jcs.org/content/early-access/2014/01/07/enhancing-photorealism-enhancement-algorithm-for-video-game- footage-from-GTA-5-and-others-in-the-open-access-journal.html#storylink=cpy.

505,505,Can An AI Heal This Image?,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we are going to play with a cellular automaton and fuse it together with a neural network. The goal is to see if the automaton can grow, and even better, maintain a prescribed shape. And if it can recover from undesirable states, can it perhaps..regenerate when damaged? Well, here, you will see all kinds of damage…and then, this happens. The best part is that this thing wasn’t even trained to be able to perform this kind of regeneration! The objective for training was that it should be able. to perform its task of growing and maintaining shape, and it turns out, some sort of regeneration. is included in that. This sounds very promising, and I wonder if we can we apply this concept to something where healing is instrumental? Are there such applications in computer science? If so, what could those be? Oh yes, yes there are! For instance, think about texture synthesis. This is a topic that is subject to a great deal of research in computer graphics, and those folks have this down to a science. Now, get this, this new paper attempts to do the same with neural cellular automatons. We like those around here, so let's give it a try!",New Papers on Cellular Automatons

507,507,Google’s New AI Puts Video Calls On Steroids!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: New neural network-based learning methods can be applied to telepresence applications. The method recreates the image as if she was really there. The result includes high-quality specular highlights too, or the environment reflecting off of our skin. The whole method was trained on still images, yet, it still works on video too! And we don’t have any apparent temporal coherence issues, or in other words, no flickering arises from the fact that it processes the video as not a video, but a series of separate images. I think this will be a game changer. People may start to become more selective with these backgrounds, not just because of how the background looks, but, because how it makes them look. And this will likely happen not decades from now, but in the near future. And I expect that this will supercharge our meetings quite soon. My goodness, what a time to be alive!

StyleGAN2 uses walks in a similar latent space to create these human faces and animate them. A small change that creates these beautiful results is what we call an equivariant filter design, essentially this ensures that finer details move together in the inner thinking of the neural network. And not only that, but the results are much smoother and more consistent, to the point that it can not only generate photorealistic images of virtual humans. Come on, that is so 2020. So, I wonder, did the new technique also inherit the generality of StyleGAN 2? Let’s see.

Today we are going to take a bad choppy video, and make a beautiful, smooth and creamy footage out of it. With today's camera and graphics technology, we can create videos with 60 frames per second. But when we try to slow down the videos for some nice slow-motion action, this ratio becomes even worse, creating an extremely choppy output video because we have huge gaps between these frames. In this example, we are done here, we don’t need any new papers. Is that so? Well, let’s see what we have only one more paper down the line! Now, look. It promises that it can deal with 10 to 1, or even 20 to 1 ratios, which means that for every single image in the video, it creates 10 or 20 new ones. Well, those are big words, so I will believe it when I see it. So good! But wait, it is not 2019, it's 2021, and we always say that two more papers down the lines, and it will be improved significantly.

520,520,Virtual Bones Make Everything Better!,"The new method can be computed much, much cheaper. It works by creating something that the authors refer to as virtual bones. Even with only a 100 virtual bones, we get an acceptable animation. However, the technique is still somewhat inaccurate around the knee and the hips. This is linear blend skinning, a state of the art method. It takes about 5 milliseconds a hundred characters rocking out, and the technique doesn’t even break a sweat.

The paper proposes that these AI agents look at the screen, just like a human would, and engage in open-ended learning where the tasks are always changing. The goal is for these agents to learn more general concepts, and, as a result, maybe excel at a variety of different tasks. In the Hill game, the goal is to take the white floor and get the other agent to get the red floor. As they are playing this game for the first time, they have no idea where the white is. As soon as the blue agent finds it, it stays there…so far, it is not a good idea. And in this King of the Hillgame, the goals are to get as close to the purple pyramid as we can. Does that mean that? …Yes, yes it does! Great job bending the rules, little AI! In this game the agent is asked to stop the purple ball from touching thered floor. It tries to block the rolling with its body, then, look! it is much better to just push against the wall. And it gets even better. It is completely right, this needs further energy expenditure, and the ball never touches the redfloor again! Great!",AI - A New Game!

This new technique leans on a previous method  to find the boy, and the dog. It can also remove people from this trampoline scene, and not only the bodies, but it also removes their effect on the trampolines as well. And if we can find the background in a video, we can even change the colors in the video, so it keeps the flamingo, but keeps the reflection of the flaminga. And, if you think that this dust was the new algorithm at its best, then have a look at this drifting car. It grabbed the smoke and the car and removed the smoke together…and once again, nothing to see here. And now, let’s see the new method..and! Whoa  It knows about the reflections and ripples,   finds both of them, and gives us this beautifully clean result. Wow. Do you? Let me know in the comments below!

The agents learned to lunge, deflect, evade attacks, and more. The researchers didn’t quit after a 130 million steps, they just kept on and eventually, they succeeded. The agent did is perhaps the AI equivalent of hypnotizing the opponent, if you will. What does that mean for an intelligent agent? Well, it means that over time, it will learn to do that a little better. And if you have been holding on to your papers, now, squeeze that paper, because all they looked at before starting the training was 90 seconds of motion capture data. This is a general framework that also works for fencing as well. Absolutely amazing. What a time to be alive! So, this was approximately a billion training steps, right. So how long did that take to compute? It took approximately a week. And, you know what’s coming. And two more papers down the line, I bet this will be possible in a matter of hours.

The blue objects show the prediction of the multi-camera network that can do that, and things aren’t perfect, but they are significantly better the single- camera network. And, perhaps more importantly, we can also make predictions about vehicle behavior, even if it is so far away and so fast. And what else can we do if our self- Driving system has a concept of time? Much like humans do, these predictions can make predictions in terms of mapping what is likely to come, and what is going to take place in a roundabout and so on. We’re doing it Papers style. Why?

The whole concept generalizes well for other kinds of games too, he says. Dr. Zsoltai-fehér will be back next week to talk about his new book, ‘The Art of the Game’. For the rest of the papers, visit the Two Minute Papers section of our website. We’ll see you next time for a talk on the ‘Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games’, which will be held at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Science and Engineering Center. For more information, visit www.cse.ac.uk or www.academyofcomputergames.co.uk. We hope to see you back at the end of the month for a discussion about the “Art of the game”, which we’re planning to discuss in more detail in the next episode of our series, “The Art Of The Game,” which will air on November 14th.",Computer Games - The Art of the Game
529,529,This AI Makes Digital Copies of Humans!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér looks at a paper with two twists. This is the geometry of a virtual human inside a virtual world. We get tons of fine details, and the movements have improved significantly. The results are so realistic that objects the in virtual scene can cast a shadow on our model. And now, yes, you remember that I promised  two twist number two? Well,   it has been here all along for the entirety of  this video. Have you noticed? Look, all this is from 2019. From two years ago. Two years is a long time in machine learning and computer graphics research. I cannot wait to see how it  will be improved two more papers down the line.

530,530,The Tale Of The Unscrewable Bolt!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows off a new way of simulating collision. The new technique is a hundred times faster than previous methods. It can simulate intricate mechanisms for robotics and more before committing to manufacturing anything. And, if you feel the urge to build a virtual bike, do not worry for a second, because your chain and sprocket mechanisms will work exactly as you expect to. What a time to be alive! Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! The First Law Of Papers is that research is a process. Do not look at where we are,   look atwhere we will be two more papers down the line. And I am sure   even the more complex simulations will be done  in a matter of seconds. The time step size used with the new method is a 100 times bigger, which is great, we can advance the time in bigger pieces when computing the simulation. But every time we do so, we still have to compute a great deal more. The resulting computation time is still at least  a Hundred times slower than previous method. The one with the intermittent motion takes less than a second per time step, which  likely means a few seconds per frame,   while the bolt screwing scene is likely in the minutes per frame domain.",The New Method of Simulation for Robotics
531,531,NVIDIA’s New Technique: Beautiful Models For Less!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: Sometimes geometries are so detailed that they are prohibitively expensive to store and render efficiently. He explains how NVIDIA’s new system is at simplifying virtual objects. The process is truly a sight to behold, he says, and it even works for animated characters. He concludes by saying, “I hope you enjoyed it at least half as much as I did, and if you are thinking that this light transport thing is pretty cool, and you would like to learn more about it, I’m happy to teach you.’” The teachings should be available for everyone, no matter what college they go to, he adds.

532,532,This AI Stuntman Just Keeps Getting Better!,"An AI agent can look at a single clip of a motion, and can not only perform it, but it can make it better, pull it off in different environments and it can even put in a different body and still do it well. This agent is embedded in a physics simulation, and first, it looks at a piece of reference motion, like this one. And then, after looking, it can reproduce it. It also learned how to perform a shorter jump, a longer jump…and now, oh yes, the final boss. Wow, it could even pull off this super long jump. It seems that this super bot can do absolutely anything! Well…almost. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll be alive to see you next time! Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károley Zsoltai- Fehér, and today we are going to see how an AI can learn crazy stunts…from just one video clip. And if even that’s not enough, we can even do more. We can also ask it to perform the same task with more or less energy, or to even apply just a tiny bit of force for a punch, and to go full Mike Tyson on the opponent.",How an AI Agent Can Learn Crazy Stunts From Just One Video Clip
533,533,This AI Learned Some Crazy Fighting Moves!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We are going to see if a virtual AI character can learn, or perhaps even invent these amazing signature moves. The key challenge here was that we were given only 3 hours of unstructured motion capture data. From this next to nothing, it not only learned these motions really well, but it could weave them together, even when a specific movement combination was not present in this training data. And here comes the best part, you can even assemble your own signature attacks, for instance, perform that surprise spinning backfist, an amazing spin kick, and, yes! You can even go full Karate Kid with that crane kick. And as a cherry on top, the characters can also react to the strikes, clinch, or even try a takedown. So, with that, there we go, we are again, one step closer to having access to super realistic motion techniques for virtual characters, and all we need for this is a controller. And remember, all this already runs in real time! Another amazing SIGGRAPH paper from Sebastian Starke. And get this, he is currently a 4th year PhD student and already made profound contributions to the industry. Huge congratulations on this amazing achievement.

535,535,This AI Learned Physics...But How Good Is It?,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: The question is not whether an AI can learn physics. He says the question is how well can an AI learn physics? Let’s try to answer that question by having a look at our first experiment, he says. The new simulation technique runs from 30 to almost 60 times faster than previous methods, says Károley. And just think about the fact that just a year ago, an AI could only perform low-resolution fluid simulations, then, a few months ago, more kinds of simulations. And then, today, just one more paper down the line, simulations of this complexity. What a time to be alive! Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!

536,536,Watch This Virtual Dinosaur Fall Into A Cactus!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presents a new way of simulating elastic interactions. The new technique computes a reduced simulation instead of a reference simulation. The reduced simulation is 110 times quicker than the reference simulation, which is ten to fifteen times faster. This new technique can be done in seconds per frame, so we don’t need an all nighter for such a simulation, just a coffee break. The two are close to equivalent, but this is more than a 100 times quicker? Sign me up, right away! Now note that this particular scene is really suited for the new technique, other scenes aren't typically a hundred times faster, but, worst case scenario is when we throw around a bunch of furballs, but even that is at least ten to 15 times faster than the previous method. Thanks for watching and for your generous support, I'll see you next time!

539,539,Watch This Statue Grow Out Of Nothing!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We can take any shape in the real world, make a digital copy of it, and place it into our virtual world. We take a photograph, and find a photorealistic material model that we can put into our light simulation program that matches it. This work did very well with materials, but, it did not capture the geometry. This other work is from Wenzel Jakob’s group and it jointly found the geometry and material properties. Seeing these images gradually morph into the right solution is an absolutely beautiful sight. But, as you see high-frequency details were not as good. You see here these details are gone. So, where does this put us? If we need only the materials, we can do really well, but then, no geometry. If we wish to get the geometry  we can use this, but we lose a lot of detail. There seems to be no way out. Is there a solution for this? Well, a new paper also proposes an isotropic remeshing step, which does…this! On the count of one, two, three. Boom, we are done. Whoa! So good. Now, make no mistake, this is not super useful in its current state, but it may pave a way to even more sophisticated methods two more papers down the line.",The Isotropic Remeshing Step

One side is made of a spongy material, and if it starts absorbing the water, let’s see if it sinks. Experiment number three. Absorption on steroids. The beauty of building these virtual worlds is that we can have these simulations under our artistic control. The crazy three-sponge experiment used about quarter  of a million particles for the fluid, and another   quarter-ish million particles to simulate the solids.

557,557,"Photos Go In, Reality Comes Out…And Fast!","Károly Zsolnai-Fehér has created a new way to create a photorealistic video. The new technique doesn’t require a neural network, and thus trains so quickly, that it almost immediately looks like the final result. The previous technique was able to produce this after approximately 1.5 days of training. And, what about the new technique? All it needs is 8.8 minutes. And the result looks like this. Not only as good, but even a bit better than what the previous method could do in 1. 5 days. And all this after 20 minutes of processing? Bravo! And, it does not stop there. It works well on forward-facing scenes, 360 degree rotations, and we can even use it to disassemble a scene into its foreground and background elements. Such incredible improvement in so little time.

The amount of detail we can simulate with these programs is increasing every year. And, this new paper promises to be more robust and detailed than traditional techniques. But, is this really how the smoke should behave? The authors tested that too, and now, hold on to your papers, and…look! I could add the labels here, but does it really matter? The two look almost exactly the same. Almost pixel perfect. By the way, here you go. So, wow, the list of positives just keep on growing. But we are experienced Fellow Scholars   here, so let’s continue interrogating this method. Some techniques look great in a empty scene, but break down when placed into a real scene where other objects are moving around. Well, I am getting more and more convinced with each test. What is the price to be paid for all this? Let’�s get these puffs and smoke in the real-time domain in a few seconds per frame. And even if you don’t even need your graphics card, it runs on your computer, and getting beautiful puffs of smoke in real time is a real treat.",The New Paper on Spiral-Spectral Fluid and Smok Simulations

Today we are going to see how a robot doggy can help us explore dangerous areas. Well, not this one, mind you, because this is not performing too well. Why is that? Well, it is a proprioception robot. This is essentially blind. Really. It only senses its own internal state and that’s it. For instance, it knows about its orientation and twist of the base unit, a little joint information, like positions and velocities, and that's about it. It is still remarkable that it can navigate at all.

The search space for this problem is still stupendously large, perhaps not as big as playing a continuous strategy game like Starcraft 2, but the search here is much less forgiving. At about a score of 90, we can think of protein folding as a mostly solved problem. The competition gets a little harder over time, so even flat-no-no methods can be better than the previous methods. If you have been holding on to your papers, let’s squeeze on your papers now! The competition is not only flat, but it is harder and harder, and it is not even close to being as challenging as Protein folding. To demonstrate that, look, this is CASP. I've heard DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis call it the Olympics ofprotein folding. And that is true. The results are not only not too good, but they appear to get worse over time. What is going on here? Well, there is an explanation. And you will see that nothing that came before even comes close to it, and that it truly is a gift to humanity. Oh my goodness. This work is history in the making.

Once again, the results look like a nearly pixel-perfect copy of the reference simulation. And, we now  understand the limitations of the old rad Curiosity,   so, let’s strike where it hurts the most. Yes, I can hardly believe what I am seeing here. Still, I am loving it! But wait a second, yes, yes. In fact, let's look at an equal-time comparison. In that case, the reference is great, but if we have the reference, why not just use that that's right? Well, that's the reference. Well, I hear you asking. Why talk about this ancient technique? I’ll tell you in a moment. You’'ll see, I promise.",Radiosity - The New Technique

581,581,OpenAI’s New AI Thinks That Birds Aren’t Real!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. We explore what happens if we unleash an AI to read the internet. And then, ask it some silly questions and we’ll get some really amazing answers. But how? Well, in the last few years, OpenAI set out to train an AI named GPT-3 that could finish your sentences. Then, they made Image-GPT, this  could even finish your images. But, scientists at OpenAI identified that  it really isn’t great at following instructions. Here is an excellent example. Look, we ask it  to explain the moon landing to a 6-year old,   it gets very confused. It seems to be in text completion mode instead of trying to follow our instructions. Meanwhile, this is InstructGPT. This is their new method, which can not only finish our  sentences, but also, follow our Instructions. And, with round 3, we really see that it was really not meant to do this. By round 4, we see that with GPT, we can get the usual confusion. And by round 5, we even get the answer to the question, “About a wise frog’s wisdom”",OpenAI - The New Way to Read the Internet
582,582,NVIDIA's New AI: Next Level Image Editing!," NVIDIA’s Alias-Free GAN technique can morph one result into another. It can do more semantic edits to our images. Can even take an image of a bird, and adjust their beak sizes, even to extreme proportions. Can learn general concepts from very few examples. Real learning from just 16 examples. That is absolutely incredible. And this is just one year in to the progress we’ve come. And don’t forget, two more papers are coming down the line, and we will look at where we are, where we will be, in the next year or so. Do not look at the research papers, but at the supplementary materials, so, make sure to have a look at that. If you do, you’ll find that it can even take a picture of a statue, and make it look like a statue. Or, we can even ask them to look up, and I have to say, if no one would tell me that these are synthetic images, I might not be able to tell that they are. What a time to be alive! Now, on to the Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Back to the page you came from.",NVIDIA’s Alias-Free GAN Technique Can Do More Semantic Editing to Our Images
583,583,OpenAI DALL-E 2: Top 10 Insane Results!,"In June 2020, OpenAI created GPT-3, a magical AI that could finish your sentences, and among many incredible examples, it could generate website layouts from a written description. A few months later, scientists at OpenAI thought that if we can complete text sentences, why not try to complete images too? And thus, Image-GPT was born. Now, just a year later, would you look at that! Oh wow. Here is Dall-e 2! Oh my, I cannot tell you how excited I am to have a closer look at the results. So what can it do? Well, that’s not the right question. By the end of this video, I bet you will think that the more appropriate question would be “what can’t it do”? This one can take descriptions that are so specific, I would say that perhaps even a good human artist might have trouble with. And wait, it gets better, we will also see what this AI thinks it looks like. Spoiler alert it appears to be cuddly. You'll see.

584,584,NVIDIA's Ray Tracing AI - This is The Next Level!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: We are going to take a light simulation algorithm that doesn’t work too well,   and infuse it with a powerful neural network. He says we can start out using that knowledge, and make up for the differences over time. He shows us an example of a scene where the light is coming from not here, but through a door that is ajar. And, he says, we can also pick a point in space, and learn what the world looks like from this point and how much light scatters around it. He concludes by saying that we have a new way of rendering light scenes that can be used in the future to make them more realistic and more realistic in terms of color and light intensity, and that we are looking forward to the day when we can use this technique in the field of computer graphics. The paper is published in the journal Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CPR) and is available on the arXiv.org website.

586,586,DeepMind’s New AI Finally Enters The Real World!,"DeepMind’s amazing AI, MuZero that plays Chess and other games   has now finally entered the real world and has learned to solve important real-world problems. MuZero is one of the best in the world in Chess, Go, and Stacraft 2 as well. Scientists at DeepMind decided to start using their MuZero AI to create a real solution to a very important problem. Video compression is a video game. The smaller the output video, the better. That is going to be our score. And, it also uses self-competition, which is now a popular concept in video game AIs. If it can reliably do that, we can conclude that the AI is indeed improving. This concept works on boxing, playing catch, Starcraft and I wonder how this would work for video compression? Well, let’t immediately  drop it into deep waters. We are going to test this against a mature, state of art video compression algorithm   that you are likely already using at this very moment as you are watching this on Youtube. Well,   good luck little AI, but I’ll be honest, there  is not much hope here. These traditional video compression algorithms are a culmination of decades of ingenious human research. Can a newcomer AI beat it? I am not  sure.",MuZero AI - Video Compression
587,587,NVIDIA’s Robot AI Finally Enters The Real World!,"Scientists at NVIDIA are training an AI that moves a virtual robot arm to finish everyday tasks on a table. It learned to do this, and more, from only 179 image-action pairs. That, in the era of learning-based techniques, is almost nothing at all. The knowledge it learned in the simulation transfers to reality, and the AI still works wonderfully. It can move chess pieces. And, believe it or not, it can even read. This is what you see here is what researchers refer to as 2real. Teaching an AI something in a simulated world, and then deploying it into the real world is what is all good for. One example, Open Open Robotics, is already working on creating virtual worlds for self-driving cars and there are plans to use this technology in the future. Look, for an example, look, for the robot hand in a simulation to be able to rotate these Rubik cubes onto a real hand, and look! It can use this software on a robot, and it can use it on their virtual cars, and there is potential for it to be used in the car industry as well. It is already being used by Tesla to create virtual worlds and cars for self driving cars. And it can also be used to train robots in other fields, such as medicine.",Training AIs in Simulations
588,588,DeepMind's New AI: A Spark Of Intelligence!,"DeepMind’s AI can learn from humans doing silly things, like playing the drums with a comb. If this AI does something, is this imitation, or is this learning? Imitation is not that impressive, but if it can learn general concepts from examples like this, that would perhaps be a little spark of intelligence. How quickly does this AI learn, and is it as good as a human? So, learning speed. I am super happy because learning is already happening by watching humans mingle for about 12 minutes. That is next to nothing!   Amazing. And, one more thing that makes me perhaps  even happier. I don’t see a sudden spike in the growth, I see nice, linear growth instead. And if we look at the task of lifting a drum, oh yes, how nice, although at a slower pace than the previous task. And yes, yes, I love it, yes this is the corner of the internet where we get unreasonably excited by a blue line.

He says the AI is nearly an expert at almost  everything. The pace of improvement in AI research is absolutely incredible, but we are still not there yet, he says. Károley: We are steadily closing in on the human-level experts in many areas at the same time, and progress is still not plateauing. It still has more left in the tank. How much more? We don’t know yet,   but as you see, the pace of Improvement in AI  research isabsolutely incredible. We are slowly getting there, but it is still a long way to go, and it is going to take a long time before we reach the tipping point, Dr. Zsolnai-fehér says.

592,592,This AI Makes You A Virtual Stuntman!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we will try to create a copy of ourselves, and place it into a virtual world. To do this, we have to ask an artist to create   a digital copy of us, which takes a lot of time and effort. But, there may be a way out. With this earlier AI-based technique, we can take a piece of target geometry, and have an algorithm try to rebuild it to be used within a virtual  world. The process is truly a sight to behold. And, believe it or not, it has even more coolness up the sleeve. If you have been holding on to your papers so far, now, squeeze that paper, because here comes my favorite part of this work. The authors of the  paper gave us not just the blueprints for   the technique in the form of a research paper,  but they also provide the source code of this technique to all of us free of charge.

This method is 10 to a 100 times faster than previous techniques, and it also maps really well onto our graphics cards. The magic behind all this is a smarter allocation of these ray samples that we have to shoot into the scene. Imagine that you are a good painter, and you are given this task to finish it in a matter of milliseconds. That is insanity. And to be able to create something that is 10 times better in this environment? That is a very very very good thing. It is the future of computer graphics, and I am excited to see what the future has in store for us in the field of 3D graphics. I am looking forward to seeing what you all have to say about it!

For instance, OpenAI’s GPT-3 technique is capable of all kinds of wizardry, or creating plots, spreadsheets, mathematical formulae,   and many other things. But how about, endowing a real robot, moving around in the real world with this kind of understanding of language? I wonder what that could do? Well, check this out! Scenario 1. This little robot it uses G PT-3 and other language models, and it not only understands it, but it can also use this knowledge to help us. Scenario 2. It also looks around,   locates the most important objects required,  and now, it knows enough to make recommendations as to what to do. This one is as close   to a personal butler as it gets.

600,600,"NVIDIA’s Ray Tracer: Wow, They Nailed It Again!"," NVIDIA’s incredible light transport algorithm can render these notoriously difficult photorealistic smoke plumes, volumetric bunnies, and even explosions interactively. They built on a previous technique of theirs that is capable of rendering 3.4 million light sources, and not just for one image, but it can even handle animation. This technique also pulls off all this wizardry by trying to get all this information that is typically thrown away with no reuse. And…whoa! There is no contest here! We are almost there right away! It has so much less flickering than the previous technique. And it works not just on this example, but on many others as well. This is so far ahead of the previous Technique that it seems like science fiction. I absolutely love it. However, yes I can hear you asking, Károly, but these are still noisy, so why get so excited for all these incomplete results? Well, do you remember what we did with the previous NVIDIA light transport paper? We took these noisy inputs, and plugged them into a denoising technique that is specifically designed for light transport algorithms. It tries to guess what is behind the noise. And as you know, can they help so much? But you know so much.",NVIDIA Light Transport Algorithm - Rendering 3.4 Million Light Sources

This can build virtual cars,  virtual creatures, even paint the Mona Lisa! These all sound amazing, but,  evolution on a computer? How? A few years ago, a really fun online app surfaced that used a genetic algorithm to evolve the morphology of a simple 2D car with the goal of having it roll as far away from a starting point   as possible. A similar concept can also be used to design  the optimal morphology of the virtual creature to make it skip forward faster. And, in this new paper, scientists at Google Brain tried to turbocharge an evolutionary algorithm to be able to take a bunch of transparent triangles, and get it to reorganize them so they can paint theMona Lisa for us. The technique they are using is called   evolution strategies, and they say that it is much faster at this than previous techniques. These are really powerful optimization techniques that can even grow this beautiful statue out of nothing of all that in just a few steps of nothing. And yes, that is very ambitious, and yes, I will believe it when I see it. And we are not done yet. This  paper has two more amazing surprises.","Evolution on a Computer - How to Build Virtual Cars, Virtual Creatures, and Paint the Mona Lisa!"

We can make people into Witchers. For instance, Grimes. Beardyman, Skrillex, Robin Williams, Obama, and The Rock. All excellent witchers! And, five, it can not only produce these images, but even interpolate between them. This means that not only the final image, but intermediate images can also be generated. This is a research paper, not a product. Yet! But NVIDIA has an excellent record of transferring these works into real products. For. instance, they published a similar Audio2Face paper in 2017, and now, just a few years later, it is out there for everyone to use. How cool is that?

Today we learn how to take an object in the real world, make a digital copy of it, and place it into our virtual world. This can be done through something that we  call differentiable rendering. We take a photograph, and have an AI find a photorealistic material model that we can put into our light simulation program that matches it. The whole process took less than an hour, but an artist can leave a bunch of these computations to cook overnight, and by the morning, a pretty good quality virtual objects will appear.

It can also generate an image of you Fellow Scholars marveling at this paper, or in the process of reading an even more explosive paper. The AI is endowed with a diffusion-based model, which means that when we ask it something, it starts out from noise, and over time, it iteratively refines this image to match our description better. The key takeaway here is that it does no, or very little copying from this training data, but   it truly comes up with novel images. So, we ask today, after these amazing results, does it really have more surprises up  the sleeve? Oh boy. By the end of this video, you will see how much of a silly question that is. We are going to have a look at 10 recent amazing results. For instance, one this is from you. Schrödinger's cat gripping the latest research papers.

A real world computer simulates this virtual world and it can do it much quicker than that. This really has amazing potential to be used in virtual worlds, because we can even have the character face into a different direction at the same time. More detailed poses can also be specified. And, with this, we can really enter a virtual environment and strike down these evil pillars with precision. Loving it. Four, these motions are synthesized synthesized and generated by a neural network called the adversar. This means that we have a generator generator creating these kinds of motions. And we are not done yet. We like to say that we are testing whether the character can recover from random perturbations. That  sounds a little more like flying boxes. Or flying boxes, if you like. Three, these excellent AI agents are passing with flying colors. And four, this is my favorite. It has to be.

607,607,NVIDIA GTC: When Simulation Becomes Reality!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér is a weekly, academic look at the latest in AI. This week, we look at some of the latest research papers from NVIDIA's GTC event. The research papers are so advanced that they are already seeing use in NVIDIA’s AI projects. We will also learn three lessons about how AI is opening up completely new frontiers that we never even thought of, and how it is connected to the real world in a way that no one has ever thought of before. We hope to see you back at the office in a month or so for the next Two Minute Papers, and we'll talk more about the future of AI in the coming years. Back to the page you came from. Click here to watch the first two minutes of the two-minute video, or click here to go to the next part of the show. The next two minutes are the second and third minutes, and they are the fourth and the fifth minutes, respectively, and you can watch them here and here. The fourth and fifth minute is the sixth and final minute, and it is the last time we talk about AI in a real world. We’re going to talk about the fourth lesson, which is that AI is everywhere today, and that it is improving incredibly fast.",Two Minute Papers With Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér
608,608,NVIDIA’s AI Plays Minecraft After 33 Years of Training!," NVIDIA’s modern AI system they call MineDojo can learn to play and build things in Minecraft and more. It can learn practical knowledge from tutorial videos, encyclopedic knowledge from the wiki, and it can learn what makes the best creations the best that are shared on reddit. It even supported interpolation, which means that we can create one landscape and ask the AI to create a blend between different styles. We just look at the output animations, and pick the one that we like best. And, with this, we also have some artistic control over the mood of the results. It seems to me that it was able to learn the concept of encircle these llamas with a fence, and even use the correct frame to build a nether portal. Very impressive. We are getting there! Do not fall! Be careful! We aregetting there! We're getting there. We're going to see how well it fares through 5 of my favorite examples. Now let's see what this AI could learn from all this data! But wait a minute! This is a gamer AI that uses the controller to move around in a virtual world. But how do we instruct it? Do we need to speak robot? If not, well,   it doesn’t even understand English text.",Minecraft AI - Can MineDojo Learn to Play and Build Minecraft?
609,609,"NVIDIA’s Ray Tracer - Finally, Real Time!"," NVIDIA is getting closer and closer to solving an almost impossible problem. They are writing real-time light transport simulations. This could render not just an image, but an animation of it interactively. But how? Well, the magic behind all this is a smarter allocation of ray samples. This technique does not forget what we did just a moment ago when we move the camera a little and advance to the next image. And, hold   on to your papers, because all this takes about 12  milliseconds per frame. And this is where I fell off the chair when this paper was published. Of course, when this is even where we have to wait for this to be real time, it’s not too far off from the amusement park. And now, remember, remember the previous paper? The one with 23 million triangles for the geometry, and over 3.4 million light sources? And here are the raw results, and after denoising, after this looks super clean. Wow! I cannot believe my eyes. I absolutely love it. And here, let me have a check here, because this is as much changing in the lighting as anyone can ever want, and  it can’t be too far away from the park too. Again, remember that I used the word interactively  twice here.   And that is not by mistake. These  techniques are absolutely fantastic,   one of the bigger leaps in light  transport research.",NVIDIA Light Transport Simulations - The Magic Behind All This
610,610,OpenAI’s DALL-E 2: Top 5 New Results!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: OpenAI’s image generator AI, DALL-E 2, can do two things that perhaps not many of you have heard of. Inpainting means that we take an input image   or video, cut out an undesirable part, and let an algorithm fill in the holes with data that makes sense given the context of this image. But Dall-E2 does something even better! It fills  in the image with any context we can think of. If a human would have made this, it would just get crazier and crazier over time. Is that a hint of creativity in a machine? I love this one. Three, of course, we need to do that to the Mona Lisa too. And these are the prompts that were used for the image inpainting here. Note that once again, once a prompt was used to generate the theme of the theme, it was once again a prompt again, and so on. And so on, until we reach the end of the paper, let me know what you think. What about you? Let me know in the comments below! So   this is fantastic? Now hold on to your papers,   because it can also do not only image  inPainting, but image outpainting! What is that? Well, two. Ever wondered what might  be outside of this frame? well, let’S ask DALL E 2 and…that is insanity.",OpenAI Image Generator - Dall-E2

He says the AI is not told what these videos are about, it is just allowed to watch them and find out for itself. And the AI learns from these unlabeled videos to be able to learn from them too, he says. Károley: OpenAI's scientists are here with their own spin of this project, not one year later, but just one week later. They say that this is the first AI that is capable of crafting Diamond tools.

614,614,Microsoft's New AI: Virtual Humans Became Real!,"Microsoft’s previous AI technique could now identify facial landmarks of real people, but, it has never seen a real person before. Now, a new paper has emerged, and in this one, scientists at Microsoft said, how about more than 10 times more landmarks? Yes, this new paper promises no less than 700. And, we are not done yet! Not even close it gets even better! I was wondering if it still works in the presence of occlusions, for instance, whenever the face is covered by hair or clothing, or a flower. It still works amazingly well! What about the colors? That is the other really cool thing it can tell us how confident it is in these predictions. Green means confident, red means that the AI has to do more guesswork, often because of these occlusion. This is one of those success stories where training an AI in a simulated world can be brought into the real world. There is a lot of factors at play here, so let's send out a huge thank you to computer graphics researchers as well for making this happen. These virtual characters could not be rendered and animated in real time without decades of incredible graphics research works. Thank you! And now comes the ultimate question: how much do we have to wait for these results? This is incredibly important.

615,615,Microsoft’s New AI: The Selfies Of The Future!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we are going to use an AI to take a collection of photos,   and hopefully create a digital human out of them. However, not so fast! For instance, have a look  at NVIDIA’s amazing face generator AI. As you see, it can generate beautiful results,  and they even show us the illusion of these characters moving around. But this  does not have a strong concept of 3D information. These are 2D images, and 3D consistency  is not that great. So, fine details, checkmark, 3D  consistency, not quite there. But a new technique that promises one megapixel images that are also consistent. So yes, we can enter into a virtual world as a digital world from a digital collection of photographs. But it seems to be a roadblock to me that is much easier to solve than to solve 3D inconsistency. And, with the new technique, now   that is what I call consistency across the video  frames. And you already see a meaningful  improvement over that. That is perfect. Now, I don’t know for sure if hair is perfect here and we are dealing with the insanity of video compression artifacts, or whether this is still not even 100% perfect.",New Technique to Improve Video Compression Artifacts

This AI is endowed with a diffusion-based model, which means that when we ask it something, it starts out from noise, and over time, it iteratively refines this image to match our description better. Here are 5 beautiful examples of how artists are already using it. And, if we have an amazing tool called Deep Nostalgia, we can plug it into an amazing works for us that works for real people. How cool is that? What a time to be alive! The Cosmopolitan magazine made their first image from an AI that was made by No. No. 1 in the world, and it was a portrait of a person. The link to his work is available in the video description. Just imagine using the free 3D modeling tool, Blender and this plugin to create roads, and you can make it an asphalt road, dirt road, make it look like pavement in just a couple clicks. Oh my.

618,618,"Stable Diffusion: DALL-E 2 For Free, For Everyone!","This year, through OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, we are  entering the age of AI-driven image generation. Most of these techniques take a text prompt, which means that we can write whatever we wish to see on the screen. But there is a problem. All of them are missing  something. And that is the model weights,   and the source code. This means that these are all closed solutions, and we cannot pop the hood and look around inside. But now, here is a new solution called  Stable Diffusion, where theModel weights and the full source code are available. With this, we  can finally take out our digital wrench   and tinker with it. For instance, we can now adjust the internal parameters   in ways that we cannot do with the  closed solutions. And, it is possible that you can run this AI  at home yourself? You’ll find out today. We don’t get many separate images, instead, we get one coherent image instead.

He says that in order to fly into these photos, we would have to invent at least 3 things. One, image inpainting is not nearly enough. Two, completely new regions should also appear that are beyond the image. And three, as we fly closer to these new regions, we will be looking at fewer and fewer pixels. He shows how Google’s new AI puts all of these together, and lets us fly into this photo. Károley: With this concept, we are roughly where DALL-E 1 was about a year ago. And just one year later, D-E 2, which will be later, could be this kind of videos, which could be just imagine what this could do. The First Law Of Papers says that research is a process.

The next two minutes will be devoted to a test with a robot that can throw a coke can and a sponge. Click there for the second half of the show to see how a robot can throw an apple and a water bottle, and then a sponge, and how a human can do it all in one go. The third and final episode will be a test of a robot's ability to throw an orange soda and a lime soda.",Two Minute Papers With Dr. Károslav Márkényi
633,633,Google’s Video AI: Outrageously Good!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today, we are going to find out whether AI programs can also do it with video. The surprising answer is that they can be almost as detailed as real life. We look at some beautiful results, while we look at more beautiful results that we noted that we’ve never seen before. And then, we have a look at 3 of my favorite examples, and then I’ll tell you how much time this took. It is an almost unfathomably short time. And to think that this is just the first iteration of Imagen Video,   wow. By the way, if you wish to see how  detailed a real physics simulation can be, make sure to check out my Nature Physics comment  paper in the video description. Now, give me a teddy bear doing dishes! Is this real? It really feels like we are living inside a fiction movie! Now, it’s a little confused by the interaction of these objects, but if someone told me a few weeks ago that an AI would be able to do this, I wouldn’t have believed it. It not only has a really good understanding of reality, but it can also combine two previous concepts, such as washing the dishes into something new.",Can AI Programs Do It With Video?
634,634,NVIDIA’s Amazing AI Clones Your Voice!,"Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér shows you how to clone real human voices using an AI. The technique asks us to say sentences and analyzes the timbre, prosody and the rhythm of our voice. And, what can it do afterwards? Well, hold on to your papers, because Jamil, the cloned AI Jamil has a scholarly message for you that I wrote. Maybe my voice here on Two Minute Papers  could be synthesized by an AI? Maybe it already   is? Would that be a good thing? What do you think? Also, a virtual Kárly for you to read your daily dose of papers, since NVIDIA has a great track record of putting these tools into everyone’s hands. I hope that some of you will be able to try this and let us know in the comments below! Thanks for your generous support, and I'll see you next time! I'll be back next week with the next episode of Two Minute  Papers with Dr.  Károslav Mikhayl-Márkiewicz, the next guest on the show. I’m looking forward to meeting you in New York City! I hope you’ll join me for the next two weeks.",Two Minute Papers - How to Synthesize Human Voices Using an AI
635,635,Ubisoft’s New AI: Breathing Life Into Games!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér: AI-based techniques can learn to clone your voice, and then,   we can perform text to speech. But get this, what  about speech to gesture? What is that? Well, scientists at Ubisoft had a crazy idea. They said, let’s create a dataset of characters where the AI can see gestures for  agreement, disagreement, being relaxed, neutral,   scared, and more. And then, the AI would generate this. Yes,   this means that we can write something,  and the AI says it in our voice. But, not so fast. Ubisoft  is not the first to try this idea, here is a technique from just two years ago. And I have to say, it does a lot of things really well from the lowest energy level gestures, up to the highest. And as a cherry on top, even some creative control is allowed. So,  these amazing virtual worlds are going to be even more full of lifelike characters, and with this work, this process will be even easier and more accessible for all of us. What a time to be alive! Thanks for watching and for your generous support, and I'll see you next time!",Speech to Gesture - A New Way to Write a Text to Speech
636,636,OpenAI’s New AI: Video Game Addict No More!,"Károly Zsolnai-Fehér uses OpenAI’s new language model AI to get it to write our homework essays for us. The AI can even write some computer code for us, and it does all this for free. But not in the way you think, as it does not read our thoughts. It reads our comments. These are not part of the code, these are a crutch to explain what the next block of code can do. And the AI knows how it can help us out. Just imagine how much easier this makes a bunch of coding work for us! And what what we can expect from speed-up techniques like this. Mind-blowing. What a time to be alive! But wait, wait, of course, not even this technique is perfect. Sometimes it just does not know when to stop. And there is more feature that I loved more when reading this paper. You would normally need to train yourself to stop this paper, but with AI it just keeps repeating itself. You will find out in a moment why. Now hold on to your papers,   because it can also write  computer code. Let’t see. Now, let’S see. First, we write, “When I  was young, I only liked to p”. And then, ‘and that�’ is how first I got interested in AI research.’ Now that�s a scholarly completion! Excellent.",OpenAI - AI Can Write Computer Code For You!
637,637,NVIDIA’s New AI: Generating 3D Models!,"Two Minute Papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Today we are going to see how this new AI can create entire virtual worlds out of thin air. To do all that, we don’t even need to be a professional artist. This can do so   much! But how much exactly? Well, let’s give  it a hard time and see what it can do through 4 really cool examples, and then, it gets  even better, I’ll tell you in a moment why. And now, hold  on to your papers and let”s have a look at the new AI technique’‘. And, if it stopped there, that would  already be amazing, but it doesn”t stop there. There is so much more! And wait, I am stunned, I promised to tell you how it gets even better. And wait! I promised you that I would show you how. And I will show you! And, wait! You’re in for a treat!’. ‘.’ ‘”.” ”. “.  ”, “‘’, ”’,. ”,”,.  , ’”‘,’ and so on.",The New AI Technique - The New AI Technique
