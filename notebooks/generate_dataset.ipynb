Martian soil contains all of the nutrientsneeded for a plant to grow. The Martian surface is covered in soil with a key ingredient of basalt, a dark, iron-rich volcanic rock. The original Martian soil simulant was created from weathered volcanic ash from near Mauna Kea in Hawaii. But this stuff, MMS, uses basalt rock found in an ancient volcano in the western Mojave Desert, which has a very similar mineral makeup to what's found on Mars. It is missing an important component of Martian soil, though, which is toxic perchlorate compounds. These could be lethal to crops on Mars, and to the humans that eat those crops. But luckily for us there are a range of different methodsariefor getting rid of them. It's really just a waiting game now, even if these things grow, they wouldn't really be keeping me full. If we're going to stay on Mars for extended periods of time, we need to generate some high-calorie food, like pea-sized plants, that will just be too heavy to bring to us with us. And we've got four varieties of micro green plants, essentially just plants that could be harvested early on.\"}"
